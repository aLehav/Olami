Like me, you might get a good laugh when a friend wakes up after a long night out only to realize that he left a tab open at the bar and ran up a bill he can’t afford. Our leaders in Congress seem to have done much the same thing. But it’s much less funny when you consider that we will be the ones paying for their drunken spending.
In 2008, the federal government’s obligations – that is, the money it has promised citizens who qualify for programs including Medicare, Social Security and veterans’ benefits – ballooned to $56.4 trillion. Each individual’s share of that bill is $184,000. Having maxed out the national credit card, members of Congress are now seeking a higher national debt limit as they go out on yet another binge. Before they do, it’s about time young people said something.
Over the last decade, our government has turned steady surpluses into monstrous deficits, doubling the national debt, which now exceeds $12 trillion. In 2009 alone, our budget deficit hit a record $1.4 trillion. We had to borrow about 40 cents on every dollar we spent. And the $383 billion we paid in interest on the national debt is enough to have covered the entire war in Afghanistan to date. At the same time, our representatives failed to address what the Government Accountability Office predicts to be a $62 trillion long-term fiscal gap created by unfunded liabilities in programs including Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The consequences of this recklessness will soon be magnified.
Consider that, within the next 10 years, the amount of money our federal government brings in will barely be enough to pay for mandatory spending on our main entitlement programs and debt interest – and that spending won’t even include the other main functions of government, from defense to education. As the red ink continues to rise, our dollar will decline, and we will be at the mercy of foreign creditors like China, who will determine interest rates and own an even greater stake in our country.
Two things are clear. First, our current fiscal path is dangerous and unsustainable. Second, as the GAO recently wrote, “the longer action to deal with the nation’s long-term fiscal outlook is delayed, the larger the changes will need to be, increasing the likelihood that they will be disruptive and destabilizing.” Now is the time to act.
On Jan. 20, the Senate is expected to vote on a measure to raise the federal debt limit – or the amount of money our government can borrow to pay its bills – by some $1.8 trillion. It will be the fifth such vote in less than two years and an opportune time to hold our leaders accountable. We must demand that they begin taking action to address our fiscal challenges – from re-establishing budget controls to managing entitlement spending. But it seems the regular order of our current legislative process, marked by institutionalized partisanship and myopia, is ill-equipped to handle such a task.
A proposal by Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) – to be offered as an amendment to the debt increase bill – will solve that problem by creating a bipartisan fiscal commission. Comprised of 18 members – legislators equally divided between chambers and parties, the Treasury secretary and a presidential appointee – the commission would study the problems before us and make recommendations that would be fast-tracked for a vote in Congress. The commission model has been effectively employed before, most notably under President Reagan in 1983 when Social Security’s solvency was successfully extended through a series of reforms.
Young people have the most to lose from continued inaction and should urge their senators to support this proposal. No longer can we accept more of the same bipartisanship – or Republicans trading their tax cuts to Democrats for their spending programs – as we dig ourselves deeper into debt. Being good stewards of our nation and the American dream requires making tough choices and working together in a sensible and productive manner.
As Thomas Jefferson often noted, one generation passing trillions of dollars of debt on to another is not just irresponsible – it is also immoral. Our elected officials have no right to squander the security and prosperity of citizens not yet enfranchised or not yet even born. It’s time for the millennial generation to organize and take a stand on this issue – not just for ourselves, but for our own posterity.

At rare moments in American history, the stars align in favor of events so dramatic that they would seem absurdly contrived if manufactured by a novelist or a Hollywood screenwriter. Take, for example, the coinciding deaths of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams – former adversaries-turned-confidants – on the nation’s 50th anniversary. Or consider the living allegory that was the Scopes trial, or even red-baiting Richard Nixon’s journey to China in 1972.
Enter Perry v. Schwarzenegger.
This week in San Francisco, oral arguments began in a case that – if ultimately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court – could make same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states. The case is made even more distinctive by the team that is representing the plaintiff. Ted Olson – arguably the most successful Republican attorney in America and the man whose argument in Bush v. Gore delivered the White House to George W. Bush – has joined with his liberal adversary in that case, David Boies, to challenge California Proposition 8, which outlaws gay marriage.
Despite its transformative potential, the case has elicited criticism from some gay rights organizations and skepticism from a myriad of legal scholars. Many believe Olson and Boies are reaching too far, too fast.
At best, commentators approach the case with ambivalence, almost as if they are already preparing themselves for an inevitable setback. Given the bitter disappointment of the gay rights community in the aftermath of Prop 8’s passage and the ballot defeat of gay marriage in Maine, this impulse is understandable.
Yet I refuse to believe that gay rights supporters do not feel, at some level, excited about the potential of the case. This exhilaration does not have to be rejected as irrational or unrealistic. For several reasons, Perry is just what the marriage equality cause needs.
First of all, the legal prognosis for the case is not as dire as many analysts suggest. If Perry is ultimately taken all the way to the Supreme Court, recent casework has set a clear precedent for the Court to decide Perry in the plaintiffs’ favor. The task at hand is to make the justices feel comfortable about striking down laws in as many as 45 states. Having a staunch conservative leading the case, especially one so admired as Olson, is the best way to do so.
But even if the dire outlook of the case proves accurate, Perry is still laudable. The marriage equality movement is at a crossroads. The state-by-state strategy has largely run its course, achieving full equality in only five states and Washington, D.C.
Each rendition of statewide voting on same-sex marriage reinforces the notion that it is acceptable to subject gay rights to majority rule. Continuing to rely on this limited strategy poses greater risk than the road taken by Perry. Issues of equality before the law belong in the courts, not at the voting booth.
The case’s greatest political potential may lie in the imagery provided by Olson’s involvement. Every conservative who reads or hears about the case will take notice that the attorney who made Bush’s presidency a reality is carrying the banner of gay marriage.
One of the most pernicious characteristics of American society is that many people live completely isolated from those who disagree with them politically. Sometimes all it takes to disrupt herd mentality is one person of a similar political disposition voicing disagreement. Not all – or even many – conservatives are likely to be immediately swayed by Olson’s role. But all conservatives will have some thinking to do.
Furthermore, the case provides a platform for Olson to begin to break down rigid ideological identities and provide a new vocabulary for the discussion of gay marriage. Many Americans conform to pre-set categories, like “social conservative,” and are not even cognizant of the language to identify themselves as conservatives who support gay marriage. Just last week, however, Olson penned an essay for Newsweek entitled, “The Conservative Case for Gay Marriage.”
On the other side, members of the gay rights movement must not consider themselves immune to the herd mentality of their conservative opponents. Perry should be a wake-up call that there is potential to find supporters in unlikely places. Doing so will require the recognition that walking lock step with the Democratic Party is not the most viable strategy to advance marriage equality. Vigorously supporting the rare Republican candidate who supports gay marriage should be a priority of gay rights organizations.
The legal journey of Perry v. Schwarzenegger may last for much of this new decade. In the meantime, however, it can provide just the shot in the arm the marriage equality movement needs to regroup, redouble its efforts and fundamentally reshape American political discourse.

On Tuesday Robert Kimmitt, former deputy secretary of the Department of the Treasury under President Bush, discussed the general employment trends as well as the global economic environment in a lecture in the Rafik B. Hariri building.
At the lecture, “Operating at the Intersection of Business, Finance and Government,” which was organized by the Distinguished Leaders Series, Kimmitt commented on the numerous jobs he has held in his life and how this has become a trend among working-age people in the United States.
“Your generation doesn’t have a concept of a single employer,” he said. “The average American worker . will have 10 different employers in the first 20 years in the workforce.”
He identified this as an accelerating change in employment habits in the United States that is based on flexibility, mobility and education.
“[The McDonough School of Business’] focus on leadership and [willingness] to operate at that intersection between business, finance and government sets you apart,” Kimmitt said.
He proceeded to discuss the growing involvement of government in business decisions, focusing on the role of the G20 in world politics, particularly since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
Kimmitt referred to the World Economic Forum recently held in Davos, Switzerland, and the G20 meeting held in Washington, D.C., in November 2008 during his discussion of the international economic situation.
“The global imbalances are principally three: the twin deficits in the United States, both fiscal and trade, the misaligned currency in China and low-demand growth in Europe and Japan,” he said.
He added that deficit reduction in the United States is imperative for improving global conditions, as the country accounts for 25 percent of the world economy. He cited this as the most significant challenge facing economic improvement and job reaction.
“Deficit reduction [is very important] to relieve pressure on economic growth,” Kimmit said.
He concluded the lecture by offering advice to graduating students about to enter the workforce, and later answered a number of questions regarding U.S. business relations with China and the European Union, among others.”

*As world leaders assembled in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December for the UN Climate Summit, three Georgetown students were also in attendance. One of them was Jessica Robbins (SFS ’12), a Science, Technology and International Affairs major with a concentration in energy and environmental studies. In addition to her course load, Jessie is an intern for Earth Policy Institute, a member of Delta Phi Epsilon and involved in the International Relations Club and its upcoming North American Invitational Model UN Conference, for which she is the director of registration. *
 
**What motivated you to go to the Copenhagen climate conference?**
 
I expected it to be a true turning point in international climate change, and I wanted to be there to study it and examine it and be there as closely as I could. I was ready to participate as a civil society [member], which is just voluntary participation by average citizens. Just to be a part of this was important to me.
 
**Did you travel alone to the conference or was it a group effort? How long did you stay?**
 
I left Dec. 10, 2009 and flew to Copenhagen with three other undergraduates: Julia Shindel [COL ’10], Olivia Chitayat [COL ’10] and Kathryn Padgett [SFS ’11] . We have a project that came out of this conference, and the project is not going to look at what happened at the conference, specifically with the policy, but will look at it holistically. The final product will be a documentary. We have already completed one panel, which was composed of people from Georgetown that went to the conference. Another panel is planned for the spring, most likely in March after the documentary comes out. We are also working on a blog, bluegrayandgreen.blogspot.com. This published everything that we did there from day-to-day events to things that we saw as well as bigger issues. Some of the things we saw were marches and activists, and a lot of pre-emptive arrests were made while we were there. Copenhagen is known to not be too friendly to civil society due to riots in previous years, so it was really intense and at times violent. Kathryn was able to see Al Gore speak, which was a highlight of the trip.
 
**What is significant about the Copenhagen conference?**
 
It’s not significant for its outcome, which was a nonbinding treaty that the [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change] said that [it] would take note of, but wasn’t adopted wholeheartedly as hoped. The accord was not that strong. But it is significant because of the attention that it got. Heads of state got together, which is major. It shows that climate change is important to everyone. President Obama demanded to meet with [the] Chinese delegation when he heard that things were not going as planned, and he took action. This conference gave climate change the attention it truly deserves.
 
**Describe your experience at the conference.**
 
It was an overwhelming, exciting, exhilarating, intense experience. It was easy to feel insignificant there because there were so many people, as well as the scope of the conference. The negotiations were closed to the public, so it was hard to tell what was going on even if you were there. The people who were involved in those negotiations had to feel comfortable talking freely, so that’s why it had to be private.
 
**What was your favorite part of the conference?**
 
It was really incredible. The people that I met, such as students from around the world, Africans who saw this final decision at the conference as life or death, really made the experience memorable. I remember in particular an old Indian guy who wrote poems about climate change. Just those kinds of experiences changed my viewpoint. Coming in as a Georgetown student, I had a narrow perspective, and I didn’t realize how easy I have it. I can return to my home easily, but some people who were there have to go back to their places and worry if it will still be there in the coming century because it might be underwater by then. I came into it as a student, but meeting people who took the conference as something emotional for them, as something that could truly affect their own life, opened my eyes. It was inspiring. Beyond the negotiations, it was nice to be able to just talk to people. It was incredible-the amount of dialogue that occurred- just talking and learning about each other.
 
**What did you do at the conference?**
 
It’s a pretty formal meeting. We watched a working group go over a document and they looked at the text very carefully to make sure that everything was how it should be, focusing on even the minute details such as using words like “shall” or “should” and which is the best to use. Many of the big decisions were made by the bigger nations. Some of the bigger issues were finance, transparency and targets. With finance, the concern was, “Who will pay and how much?” The [European Union] pledged money, and the [United States] hadn’t made a big pledge because they didn’t want to give money to China, since they thought China truly didn’t need it. In the end, everyone wanted to put forth as little as possible and still get the best deals. Finally, the [United States] decided to pledge a lot; [Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton came forward and said she would propose a fund, and although it wasn’t [clear] how much would be contributed, it was still a huge step.
Transparency was with regard to how much control and knowledge people would have about the use of the money being put forth. China didn’t want to let inspectors in or have people poking around their factories, and China is known to give accurate reports. With targets, people wanted to know who would commit and to what. Late Friday night, people began to run out of time for bargaining. The first week and a half I didn’t know what they were doing. We were able to get together, but the big open meetings were empty in substance because it was kind of a repeat of things that were already known.
 
**If you could change one thing about the conference, what would it be?**
 
I wouldn’t change too many things. In a perfect world, it would have been more open to interests of countries it represented, such as those most affected but who had the least political platform. If these were involved, their input would have been great. Usually the bigger countries with more influence such as the [United States] and China were most involved in the negotiations, while all of Africa was shut out. The most tragic result of the conference was that these countries had no say. I think that people [were] too caught up in the little details. As a whole, people were too ambitious, and this led to a weak agreement. We need feasible actions to reverse deforestation and establish better technology benchmarks to increase energy, and these would be beneficial to both the environment and the economy. I think they got hung up on the hard things so they couldn’t formalize an agreement.
 
**Do you think the conference was a success or failure?**
 
Both. It was a failure because it didn’t produce a strong agreement as hoped. However, the dialogue and attention from heads of states all around the world made it a success. The fact that it failed spurs people on to try harder. I think if we did get an agreement, it might have gotten people to feel complacent, as if they were off the hook. More things need to be fixed on a smaller scale, and I think people are starting to realize that. The situation isn’t hopeless, but we’re running out of time.

Examining communism’s grasp on post-war Poland, last night former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) screened his new film that recounts Pope John Paul II’s pilgrimage to the country and the visit’s role in restoring Polish national identity.
Addressing a packed auditorium in the Intercultural Center, Gingrich said the film, “Nine Days That Changed the World,” offered a powerful demonstration of religious faith’s power over tyranny. The Catholic Students Association sponsored the event along with the College Republicans.
“I think the concept of freedom through faith is central to the original reason that Georgetown was founded. It’s essential to the establishment of the United States. I think it is central to the struggle going on today in Cuba and China and Iran and Russia, and so many places around the world,” Gingrich said.
The documentary interviews Polish academic, political and religious leaders who discuss their memories of the visit. The sources’ emotions often bleed into the interviews, offering additional evidence of the visit’s mark on Polish hearts and minds,
While the event was co-hosted by College Republicans and featured a former Republican congressman, Melinda Reyes (SFS ’12), co-president of the Catholic Students Association, stressed that the event was nonpartisan.
“Anyone at the event would note that there was no mention of anything related to [Gingrich’s] career as speaker or his political affiliations. It was focused entirely on the role of John Paul II,” Reyes said.
Reyes added that the College Democrats were initially sponsors of the event, but they removed their sponsorship before the screening.
History professor Andrzej Kaminski said that John Paul II mixed intelligence and stubbornness with an ability to listen to his adversaries. This ability made the pope a particularly powerful force against the communist rule, he said.
“It really said a lot about the faith of the Polish people and how it united them,” Stephen McDonald (SFS ’13) said. “It showed the events from people who were actually there. [The emotion] added to it, because it’s difficult to look at those sorts of things without the emotional aspect to it.”
Reyes said at the screening that the film’s message tied closely to Georgetown’s Catholic identity.
“It is a good reminder of what role our faith as a Catholic university, and on an individual level, can have in international affairs,” she said. “There’s something inherent in faith that leads you to yearn for freedom and vice versa, and I think John Paul II really embodied that.”

World Bank Group President Robert Zoellick unveiled a new research plan and slogan for the World Bank in Gaston Hall on Wednesday morning before an audience of students and faculty.
School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster introduced Zoellick to a less-than-full Gaston, though more students trickled in throughout the lecture.
In her introduction, Lancaster noted the importance of Zoellick’s role in world affairs, especially in the buildup to the World Bank meetings set to take place in Washington, D.C., Oct. 8 to 10.
The World Bank, according to its mission statement, seeks to reduce poverty worldwide by furthering what their website characterizes as sustainable and inclusive globalization.
Zoellick invoked George Bernard Shaw, playwright and co-founder of the London School of Economics, at the outset of his speech. “If all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion,” he quipped.
“Economics has contributed significantly to how we understand our world,” Zoellick said. “But economics doesn’t always get it right.”
Zoellick emphasized the need for a global economic dialogue.
“One of the things we’re trying to do more broadly at the [World] Bank is capture [much] of the knowledge and experiences we have from people in the developed world but broaden the set of people asking these questions and how we think about them,” Zoellick said.
He added that he believed the need for an economic agenda that includes the input of people from across the globe was accentuated by the pressures of today’s economic crises.
“Indeed, [economics] can get things spectacularly wrong,” he said, pointing to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis as an example of just how flawed economics with a limited scope can be.
Zoellick framed his argument and the basis of the World Bank’s new strategy in the history of development economics and its recent failures, which he attributed to too narrow a focus in the field.
For example, he said, in the 1950s,
economists believed that all emerging markets needed was an injection of capital and even today, China and India have serious concerns regarding agriculture and infrastructure even though they are becoming market leaders. He also cited the likely failure to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, quantitative measures adopted by world leaders in 2000 to eradicate world poverty by 2015.
These shortcomings, Zoellick said, require a radical re-examination of some of the most basic principles of development economics, including a better understanding of “economic transformation,” a push for inclusive development, and a comprehensive plan to deal with economic risks.
The speech also revealed a new slogan for the World Bank’s research: “Open Data, Open Knowledge, Open Solutions.”
The bespectacled Zoellick became markedly more animated after he had finished his prepared remarks, and he responded first to a question from Lancaster about the “revolutionary” nature of his speech, which advocated a fundamentally different and ostensibly controversial open-source approach to developmental economics.”

In a brief yet personal account of her experience immersed in Pakistani flood recovery over the summer, Morial Shah (SFS ’13) shed light on the victims’ suffering to an audience in McShain Lounge Thursday evening.
“In the last week, 250 villages – 1,400 homes – were evacuated,” she said.
Shah spoke at a panel discussion sponsored by the International Relations Club that aimed to address where Pakistan stands since floods first began to ravage the Indus Valley in July. Today, flooded areas remain in the region, a sign of political and economic tension in the South Asian nation, according to Ambassador Howard Schaffer, former diplomat, former deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia and a senior counselor in the School of Foreign Service.
“The devastation could not have happened in a worse time or in a worse place,” he said.
Schaffer highlighted the perceptions of the civilian government and the military in response to the disaster. According to him, the incompetence of the civilian government in responding to the floods has weakened support for the Asif Ali Zardari administration, and the military response has generally been more effective.
Schaffer concluded that the military wants no authority as the insurgency in the country increases in tempo. Forces would prefer to let civilians take the blame for any failures, he added.
oderated by Paula Newberg, director of Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, the panel also featured Allan Jury, director of the U.N. World Food Program’s U.S. relations office, who provided information on the ongoing humanitarian relief efforts. He emphasized that the level of response varies in different areas of the country, especially as the WFP seeks to overcome three challenges: logistics, funding and security.
“It’s a massive logistical problem,” he said. The WFP has banded with other U.N. organizations, non-governmental organizations and the Pakistani government in successfully distributing food to 6 million people. It is expected that 7 million will be reached by the end of October.
aggie Ronkin, School of Foreign Service professor and a scholar from the American Institute of Pakistan Studies, spoke on the humanitarian situation in Pakistan as a result of the flooding.
“Flood waters destroyed the health care infrastructure,” she said. Ronkin also stressed the loss of vast agricultural lands and products, the increase of petty crimes, as well as problems of sanitation, disease and a lack of access to clean water – problems that existed in some areas well before the disaster.
“Food is needed for 8.2 million,” she said. “Water is needed for 7 million.”
Ed Dunn, foreign service officer on the State Department’s Pakistan Desk, rounded off the discussion with a talk on how the United States has contributed to the relief efforts in the wide-reaching disaster. The Pakistani floods have affected more people than the 2004 tsunami, the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir and the 2010 Haiti earthquake combined, according to Dunn.
Twenty-eight U.S. military helicopters as well as a number of civilian helicopters are currently carrying out the relief efforts. The U.S. government has also been working with private enterprises as well as on-the-ground contributors from Japan, China and the United Arab Emirates. Nevertheless, Dunn stressed the need for boosted coordination.
“It is still ongoing,” he said. “We’re still doing emergency relief.”
Engaging with audience members, the panelists emphasized the need for donations and better coverage to narrow the trust deficit that Pakistanis have for Americans.
IRC Chair Eitan Paul (SFS ’12) expressed his satisfaction with the event.
“I think it’s very important to start this conversation at Georgetown,” he said, “about arguably the most serious humanitarian crisis in the world today. It was nice to have a variety of perspectives.”
Information for donations as well as a donation box was made available to guests.
The event was run by the International Relations Club and held with the support of the South Asian Society, UNICEF Georgetown and the GU Task Force for Pakistan.

In a dramatic decrease from last year, only two students in the School of Foreign Service scored high enough on the Oct. 7 exam to place out of the SFS’s required Map of the Modern World course.
Last October, 65 SFS students tested out of Map of the Modern World, which was a significant increase from that of previous years. The high passing rate added fuel to student criticism of the changes James Reardon-Anderson, senior associate dean of the SFS and a Sun Yat-Sen Professor of Chinese Studies, made to the course when he took over the helm from Keith Hrebenak, a professorial lecturer in the SFS, beginning last fall.
Drew Peterson (SFS ’10), who chaired the working group established by the SFS Academic Council to examine the new course, said the exam result may not in and of itself be a means to judge the nature of the exam.
“It is impossible to evaluate this year’s exemption exam on the pass rate alone,” he wrote in an email, “though it does seem more fitting that [two students], rather than 65, be exempted from the School’s mandatory geography requirement.”
Student concerns about the class’s focus linger in response to Reardon-Anderson’s revisions, which placed greater emphasis on physical geography and earth science.
“The new passing rate means nothing. … The same concerns about the class still exist from last year,” said Josh Mogil (SFS ’11), president of the SFS Academic Council. “It is my perception that everyone in the dean’s office is hoping that this [student response] just goes away.”
Reardon-Anderson, however, maintains that last year’s changes were sensible shifts in the syllabus in the first place.
“I believe that physical geography is an approach to international affairs that has largely been neglected, to the detriment of students who are going out into the world,” he said.
The previous version of the course, he said, had other flaws as well.
“[The previous version] was really designed as a course in the map of the colonial and post-colonial world,” he said. “It paid virtually no attention whatsoever to North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. I thought that was not in the students’ best interest.”
He added that about three-quarters of student comments from the past year’s course evaluations were positive, and that he had added more specific case studies in response to the criticism.
Students’ interest in the changes to Map has faded somewhat since last year, when Reardon-Anderson’s move drew complaints that he was damaging a curricular institution and ignoring student concerns; more than 700 students joined a Facebook group named “Take Back Map of the Modern World.”
In a viewpoint in THE HOYA, Tom Zuzelo (SFS ’11) explained one of the strands of criticism.
“Judging from Reardon-Anderson’s lecture notes and his own comments,” he wrote at the time, “this survey course has been watered down and transformed into a `Rocks for Jocks’ crash course on earth sciences.”
But concerns persist among Mogil and other students in the SFS.
“It’s not about the old class versus the new class anymore,” Mogil said. “It’s about what the best Map class would be. . I look forward to addressing this issue with the deans in a cooperative and constructive way.”
The working group of students and alumni organized last year is continuing to study the changes. According to Peterson, the group is waiting for the SFS administration to distribute a survey it has prepared to the students who took the new Map course last year. If the Office of the Dean does so within the next month, the team should be able to release its final report before the next group of students begins to take the 1-year-old class next semester.
The reaction of new freshmen to the emphases they saw on the exemption exam were mostly favorable.
“I think the vast majority of what was on the test made sense,” Evan Smith (SFS ’14) said. “I think, though, that there was undue emphasis on some topics, like trade winds. . If you didn’t know the Tropic of Capricorn from the Tropic of Cancer, you were guaranteed to miss five questions.”
He added that he had heard about last year’s high pass rate but was not aware of the disputes over the curriculum.
Mary Oeftering (SFS ’14) said that she was satisfied with the test, although she added jokingly that since she planned to major in science, technology and international affairs, she might not be representative of most SFS students.
“I’m not completely aware of what was on [the exam] before, but it seemed to me that everything on there was basic, fundamental ideas that everyone going into foreign service should know,” she said.

Amid tenuous U.S.-China ties, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke opened a policy conference on the two countries’ commercial relationship on Thursday morning in the Lohrfink Auditorium with a keynote address stressing the need for cooperation.
“We’re here to discuss how we can nurture and improve the most heavily scrutinized bilateral commercial relationship on Earth – one in which our disagreements get all the headlines,” Locke said. “The United States is the most open major economy in the world, and we are committed to forging a future in which China can take full advantage of the opportunities that come with economic liberalization.”
The discussions at this conference will serve as a preamble to the next U.S.-China joint commission on commerce and trade, which will be held later in December. Panelists at the day-long conference came seeking a deeper understanding of the underlying issues between trade agreements.
Introduced by Dr. Resat Kasaba from the Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington and by McDonough School of Business Dean George Daly, Locke kicked off a day-long discussion on the economic trends and trading patterns of the United States and China, two key players in the 21st century’s global political and economic arena.
Jessica Holland (SFS ’11), a regional and comparative studies major who has been actively studying Chinese relations, said Locke gave a thoughtful presentation.
“I noticed his careful use of language,” Holland said. “He was praising China’s economic growth, but he also underlined the United States’ desire for more Chinese consumption, but he said this all in a careful way and welcomed discussion from the panelists.”
The panels were divided into four topics: China’s changing economic landscape; science and technology innovation trends in China; energy and environmental cooperation; and the impact of developments in China’s commercial legal system. Each panel had three discussants and one moderator.
Professor Robert Sutter, a Georgetown visiting professor of Asian studies in the School of Foreign Service, served as a moderator for the science and technology panel.
“This conference is a very good exercise for better insights,” Sutter said. “We need a better understanding of the economic relationships because they are subject to a lot of one-way thinking. The variety of perspectives we hear from [the panelists] is very important.”
Locke urged the panelists and moderators, who ranged from professors to representatives from the U.S. Department of Commerce, to address issues such as U.S. exports in China and mutually beneficial trade on a providence-to-providence level.
“I thought that the regional focus about Cambodia and Southeast Asia was interesting, like how they adjust to this new economic norm and model. It was helpful for me that the panelists focused in on specific areas,” Gabriel Ruth (GRD) said. Ruth works for Tailored Solutions & Consulting, and she plans to go to China next summer for a global residency program.
While panelists did acknowledge the growth of trade between the two countries in the last decade, there was much discussion about the cultural challenges and the potential ability of Chinese companies to become lucrative trading partners for the United States.
Panelist for “China’s Changing Economic Landscape,” Courtney Gregoire, director of the National Export Initiative at the Commerce Department, recalled her interactions in a trip to China for the U.S.-China legal exchange.
“There was a lot of robust dialogue between us and the Chinese officials about how to administer the National Export Initiative and the free trade agreements,” Gregoire said. “While a lot of U.S. companies see the nine to 10 growth rate and are excited to trade in China, only 1 percent of small medium-sized companies are exporting, and 58 percent of those are exporting to Canada and Mexico.”
Panelist Shang-Jin Wei, professor of finance and economics at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business, echoed Gregoire’s concerns, but from the Chinese perspective.
“China is one of the few places that will allow U.S. exports to double once every five years. The key to increase U.S. net exports is not micro, or firm-level competitiveness, but a macro, country-level savings-investment balance,” Wei said.
Overall, the conference seemed to explore the struggle with China’s changing political, social and technological trends, and how they might align with those of the United States in the future. The relationship between these two major global influences has already improved in the past decade, and Locke assured speakers and attendees of the conference that more collaboration will fuel global economic prosperity.
“As recently as 40 years ago, a commercial relationship between the United States and China barely existed,” Locke said.
“Successful engagement between the Commerce Department’s scientific agencies and Chinese research institutes, government labs and government agencies are essential parts of us creating a more integrated economic relationship.”

As Chinese President Hu Jintao visited the White House Wednesday, first lady Michelle Obama stepped on stage at Howard University to encourage students to study abroad in the dignitary’s home country.
“Studying in countries like China isn’t only about your prospects in the global marketplace,” Obama said. “It’s not just about whether you can compete with your peers in other countries to make America stronger. It’s also about whether you can come together and work with them to make our world stronger.”
Obama discussed major commitments to Chinese cultural exchange as part of the 100,000 Strong Initiative announced by her husband in 2009. In her opening remarks she stated that private sector pledges would provide more than $2.25 million to support an increase in the numbers of American students who study in China by 2014.
China, which is one of the top five host countries to American students, has offered more than 10,000 scholarships funded by the Chinese government called bridge scholarships that cover all in-country costs. The 100,000 Strong Initiative aims to bolster this effort, and also expand it to included even younger students.
“[Studying abroad is] how, student by student, we develop that habit of cooperation,” Obama said.
Some students said that they were inspired by Obama’s remarks.
“As an exchange student from China to America, I have seen that cultural exchange is the only way to get closer for sure, because you learn so much more than just in books of the subtle cultural differences,” Yifei Zhao, a student from Shanghai currently studying at the Sidwell Friends High School, said. “That is part of the educational exchange: if I could express the relationship between the ways we attend class, go out, or just live, then I wouldn’t be here right now.”
Other students, however, prioritize finishing college as soon as possible above living in foreign countries.
“Maybe after I get a job I’d go abroad for a year,” Howard University student Daniel Jacques said.
Empathizing with students who feel that studying abroad is not an option for them, Obama recalled her college experience, which she felt focused on earning a degree quickly above study abroad experiences.
“Maybe [students] may feel like study abroad is something that only rich kids do, or maybe kids who go to certain colleges; they’re the only ones who do that,” Obama said.
The panel following Obama’s speech, which consisted of four high school and college students who had lived in China, sought to curb these fears and discussed the possibility of studying abroad without high costs. Panelist Lyric Carter, a junior at the Phelps Architecture, Construction and Engineering High School, went on a six-week program in Beijing partially funded by the State Department’s National Security Language Initiative for Youth.
“It encouraged me to go out and try anything now,” she said of the program.

Metropolitan Police Department officers identified 14 underaged drinkers, mostly Georgetown students, in the popular bar Third Edition shortly after midnight on Friday.
According to Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner and Representative to the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Bill Starrels, those identified had used false identification, but he was unsure whether or not any arrests were made.
While the university’s Department of Public Safety was not involved in the operation, the names of students charged with underage drinking and use of false identification were reported to the university, according to Associate Director of DPS Joseph Smith.
Starrels said that D.C. area university students in general were the focus of the MPD bust, even if the majority were from nearby Georgetown.
“Thirds is an easy target for many college students, not just from Georgetown,” he said. “Georgetown students weren’t the only ones in the establishment at the time, but most of them were.”
According to an affected student who wished to remain anonymous due to the legal implications of her case, police officers were inside Third Edition asking patrons for their IDs.
She said she was approached by an officer asking for the identification she had presented when requesting entry into the establishment. The officer told the student that if she did not want to be arrested, then she needed to provide information about where she had obtained the identification. The officer then asked the student for her campus address and cell phone number when she could not provide the source of her fake ID.
A second student in Third Edition Thursday who also wished to remain anonymous had a similar experience. A male police officer in plain clothes approached her and asked to see her ID. He threatened to arrest her if she did not cooperate. He did not ask where she had obtained her false identification, but did ask her where she was a student.
Neither student has heard from MPD or the university about the incident.
One Third Edition patron admitted to obtaining false identification from a China-based website, Id Chief, according to the DCist.
According to Starrels, Third Edition may face penalties after a hearing before the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration.
Starrels said that Third Edition will most likely be punished with a suspension of its liquor license, as has occurred in the past. He added that while previous suspensions of the license have occurred on weekdays, Third Edition would most likely have its license suspended on a weekend this time around, significantly impacting business.
Starrels indicated that the establishment was at fault and any punishment will be justified.
“Obviously students were wrong to be going in there to drink, but there is a responsibility by the establishment to do what it takes to keep a young person out of there,” Starrels said. “It’s been suggested multiple times by the ANC that they ask for two IDs automatically.”
The Office of Student Conduct, MPD, the ABRA and Third Edition could not be reached for comment.

University President John J. DeGioia has racked up frequent flyer miles this academic year, visiting Britain, Singapore, India, Switzerland, Qatar and Mexico since July.
As his travels take him across the world to speak in scholarly settings and economic forums, DeGioia seeks to propel Georgetown onto the global academic scene.
“What I have tried to do in each of my talks is raise a key theme, which is that we have allowed globalization to be defined in market and economic terms,” DeGioia told The Hoya. “The real contribution of the academy is to bring characteristics of the ethos, the characteristics of the university, to bear on globalization.”
To kick off his summer travels, DeGioia visited Wales in July. There he received an honorary fellowship from Owain Glyndwr University.
During his trip to Singapore in August, he delivered the second annual S.T. Lee Distinguished Lecture on Universities for a Global Society at the National University of Singapore. Lee Bollinger, president of Columbia University, delivered the speech for its debut run last year.
Touching on his broad international experiences, DeGioia explained that every place he visits teaches him something new.
“Each place has its own distinct character and culture with a unique set of questions,” said DeGioia. “The lens in which I explore the different countries and cultures is through the lens of higher education. I tried during my travels to engage my colleagues to discuss the contributions higher education can make to expand the meaning of the term ‘globalization.'”
In November, DeGioia devoted a week to developing higher education in India, heading a delegation of university leaders visiting New Delhi to study the educational infrastructure and seeing the Child Rights Information Center in Badarpur.
Presenting the keynote address at the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, DeGioia spoke on reforms in Indian higher education. Yale University President Richard Levin, Oxford University Chancellor Chris Patten and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers delivered the past few keynote addresses.
DeGioia’s mission to improve higher education abroad is not without reason. The president said that there is a need for 40 million new jobs to meet the demographic trends across the Arab world, for example. In order to meet job demands, higher education has to expand not just in the Middle East but everywhere.  In India, there has been a calculated need for 600 new universities, DeGioia explained.
“What I have tried to do in each of my talks, and there are some similarities and some differences between them, is raise the key theme that there is a need for more higher education,” said DeGioia.
January took him to Davos, Switzerland, where he participated in the World Economic Forum annual meeting. The president also launched his Facebook page that month, and followers could read about the sessions he attended at the conference including “Yes is More: The Architecture of Inclusivism” and “Insights on China.”
On Feb. 15, DeGioia was in Mexico for the board of trustees meeting at the Monterrey Institute of Technology, one of the largest universities in Latin America. There he joined former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, President of Arizona State University Michael Crow and President of the Monterrey Institute of Technology Rafael Rangel Sostmann to discuss the impact of globalization on higher education.
“We must recognize the urgent need to deepen and expand our opportunities for access,” DeGioia said at the conference. “We must leapfrog, using technology to ensure all of our people have access to the learning necessary for participation in a global economy.”
In true jet-setting fashion, DeGioia had arrived in Mexico after coming from Doha, Qatar, where he had celebrated the official opening of the new Georgetown School of Foreign Service-Qatar building in Education City.
The travels forge connections not only with other universities but with Georgetown alumni as well. International alumni clubs, such as the ones in Singapore and New Delhi, have welcomed DeGioia around the globe and 50 members from the New Delhi alumni center honored him with a reception ceremony.
DeGioia’s Facebook page serves as a hub for students and alumni to keep track of the president’s travels. On the page, he writes of his intention for students to “learn more about the privilege I have of representing Georgetown in many different contexts, whether here on the Hilltop, in the city of Washington, D.C., or in various locations around the world.”
The territory covered is vast, in terms of both geography and the topics on tabs, but DeGioia summed up his travels succinctly.
“It’s been a conversation.”

When at a business mixer, where should you stick your name tag? Is it appropriate to have an alcoholic beverage during a job interview in a restaurant if you’re over 21? Is it all right to introduce yourself in a professional environment with only your first name?
Students from Georgetown’s professional foreign service sorority Delta Phi Epsilon received the answers to these questions — on your right side, probably not and never — and more at an etiquette and protocol training session by hospitality consultant Alexandra Kovach Sunday afternoon.
Kovach, a former Georgetown program manager who ran the Baker Scholars Program, heads Alexandra & Company, LLC, a company that offers event planning and hospitality consulting services.
Kovach’s lecture was the first of several events and speakers DPE has lined up for the semester.
Her presentation “How to Hold a Fork,” focused on proper etiquette in professional settings. Kovak offered DPE sisters a range of advice on how to conduct themselves to make a favorable impression on potential employers or future business associates.
“More and more now, job interviews are happening at the dinner table or they’re taking you out to lunch. And I can promise you that if you have the most fabulous resume, you’re extremely well educated, top of your class and you drink out of the guy’s water glass, you’re not going to get the job,” Kovach said.
DPE Vice President Wendy Wang (MSB ’11) said that while some might consider the information presented common sense, it is important for students looking to become professionals to educate themselves on etiquette specific to their fields.
“I spent one summer interning in China, and even though my parents are Chinese, I didn’t know how to behave in a professional environment,” Wang said.
Professional Chair of DPE Dena Sholk (SFS ’13) said she found the lecture particularly relevant to Georgetown students trying to secure a spot in today’s highly competitive job market.
“All of us do internships, we’re all very good students, we’re all very motivated and accomplished in our own fields, and I think there’s very much that [question of] how do you market yourself and how do you work on little things like etiquette that you don’t think of but that are actually incredibly important,” Sholk said.
Sholk said that she thought the lecture provided DPE members with important insights that they could apply to many professional situations, whether at an event on campus or while pursing career opportunities abroad.
“People, let’s be honest, they judge you,” she said. “You’re making a first impression, and knowing these things [makes a difference]. I think everyone got a lot out of it today.”

The Department of Education hosted the first ever Voices in Action: National Youth Summit on Saturday to discuss how to make U.S. college graduation levels the highest in the world by 2020.
The summit gave high school and middle school students from around the country the chance to engage in discussion and listen to leaders in U.S. education.
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who gave the keynote address, said that the White House believes that improving post-secondary school graduation rates and increasing the percentage of Americans with degrees are vital to the country’s future economic success.
“[Today’s young Americans] are competing for jobs with people from India, China, South Korea, Finland,” Duncan said.  “The President believes the countries out-educating us today will out-compete us tomorrow.”
Duncan and other government officials offered up solutions to potential obstacles facing this goal.
One concern revealed in surveys collected during the National Youth Listening Tour in 2010 was the affordability of higher education.
Low-income families who participated in this Education Department initiative expressed frustration with the steady rise of college tuition fees across the nation, according to a video summary of the results shown at the opening of the summit.
In the past decade, many universities, both public and private, have had to increase the price of tuition to deal with inflation and to increase the quality of their programs.
Georgetown’s tuition rate rose by 3 percent from 2010 to 2011 and will increase again by 2.9 percent from 2011 to 2012, according to a Feb. 11 press release. The total cost for two semesters of an undergraduate education, complete with room and board, will reach $53, 910.
Duncan said that students who cannot pay the tuition at traditional four-year universities do have other options. Students might pursue less expensive degrees at three-year programs, community colleges or trade schools.
“I can’t tell you how critically important it is that you make sure we are invested in education, because education is not an expense — it is an investment,” Duncan said.
Other speakers at the event said that to reach the president’s goal, college education and skills advancement must become popular among the nation’s youth.
Kalpen Modi, a well-known actor and the White House liaison to Young Americans, the Arts and Asian American and Pacific Islander Communities, said that today’s students have the power to improve the U.S.’s current educational ranking.
“With the Democrats and Republicans [in Congress and the government] going back and forth, it is easy to forget how young people can change things,” he said.
Modi and Kaya Henderson, interim chancellor of D.C. public schools, both told young people to be unafraid to express their ideas to government leaders and to enact change themselves.
“You know who the best teachers are. You know what curriculum is meeting your needs and getting you ready for the world of college and careers,” Henderson said to the summit. “Demand that from [the government and educators].”

In honor of the 12th anniversary of the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, experts visited Georgetown on Tuesday to discuss the impact of the agreement and the continuing efforts to obtain the United States’ signature.
Professor and Director of the Center for International Stabilization and Recovery Ken Rutherford, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jody Williams and Director of Human Rights Watch’s Arm Division Stephen Goose participated in the panel, sponsored by Lecture Fund and the School of Continuing Studies.
The treaty, largely achieved through the efforts of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines  led by Williams, includes 132 countries worldwide and requires signatories to both halt mine production and destroy existing antipersonnel mines.
Throughout the evening, Williams stressed the importance of citizen involvement in putting pressure on the United States. She cited her organization’s success as the culmination of small commitments from many advocates.
“The ICBL really was a grassroots campaign of ordinary citizens,” she said.
Referencing the incredible strides made by the agreement — the fastest implemented multilateral treaty in history at just 15 months — Williams encouraged students to take an interest in international policy.
“Being a part of a democracy is not simply voting every four years,” she said.
Despite some dismissal of the relevance of landmine injuries, 90 percent of  the average 20,000 land mine victims per year are civilians.
Rutherford, (CED ’91, GRD ’00), provided an account of these deadly weapons. His vehicle struck a land mine — costing him both of his legs — while he was serving on an international rescue team in Somalia in 1993. According to Rutherford, he has utilized the event as the foundation for his advocacy work.
“The experience fundamentally altered my life and crystallized my vision,” he said.
One of the strongest proponents of a land mine ban in the United States, Rutherford also leads the Mine Action Information Center at James Madison University.
Despite President Obama’s creation of the Land Mine Policy Review in 2009, the U.S. still has not agreed to sign the Mine Ban Treaty. The agreement, if signed, would require the U.S. military to destroy a stockpile of over 1 million mines.
Goose expressed his frustration on the topic, saying that the United States’ obstinacy is both hampering the dangerous process of de-mining and persuading countries like China and Russia to ignore the treaty as well.
The United States has not used antipersonnel mines since the Gulf War in 1991, trivializing the need to stockpile the weapons and further complicating the matter according to panelists. Goose believes that despite written support from 68 members of the Senate and the pressure of the international community, the United States military is delaying the process because it is unwilling to reject the possibility of future land mine use.
While the United States has tried to renegotiate terms of the treaty to include smart mines, temporary explosives that do not remain in the ground for long periods of time, the international community has rejected anything aside from a complete ban.
As the ICBL and treaty members continue to up the pressure on the United States, Goose, Williams and Rutherford were optimistic that Obama would sign the treaty sometime during 2011. For now, the trio seemed mollified by the 12th anniversary.
“The treaty demonstrates what human beings can do when they care,” Williams said.

While most students begin courses at Georgetown just months after graduating from high school, some accepted students are opting to take a gap year before embarking on their university careers.
The Wall Street Journal reported in December that a Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles found that 1.2 percent of freshmen at four-year colleges waited a year before enrolling in school.
The choice to take a gap year can reflect a desire to relax after high school, to give meaning and direction to later classroom experiences or to break away from a traditional or limited academic trajectory, according to Georgetown students who took the leap.
For Anne Jamison (SFS ’14), a gap year was a necessary break after four years at an intense high school.
“I really needed a break. … If I’d come to Georgetown straight from high school I would have been burned out,” she said.
After a year abroad as an outdoor education teaching assistant in Australia’s Victorian Alps, Jamison is taking 19 credits per semester in a curriculum inspired by her gap year.
“I had time to decompress and now I’m so excited to work. I came back so excited to start learning again,” Jamison said.
Gabriel Pincus (SFS ’14), who split his gap year between an Israel-based environmental studies program and a backpacking tour of Europe, said that a gap year was a way to break free of the life path students in the United States are expected to follow.
“America sets up this track that’s like a race. When you’re expected to stuff your résumé, go to college, go to law school and get your first job, when do you live anymore?” Pincus said.
Jake Sneeden (SFS ’12) devoted his time in between graduation and convocation to traveling in Australia and New Zealand.
“I knew I wanted to take a gap year my junior year in high school when I was reading Conrad’s ‘Heart of Darkness,’ and it sort of struck me that my experiences that I had had were not raw or powerful, but rather just repeating an old pattern, a worn path,” he wrote in an email.
Some who took gap years said their experiences have provided valuable insights that have enhanced their studies at Georgetown.
Zander Rounds (SFS ’14), who participated in an international development program in Ecuador, China, India and South Africa, said that his experiences have helped him contextualize what he is learning in the classroom.
“Let’s say I’m in [Map of the Modern World] and we’re talking about an issue in India. I’ve been there and seen it and worked with people and talked to people there. Having that context to draw on has enriched my academic experience,” Rounds said.
Pincus said that his year abroad sparked a new interest in sustainable international development, inspiring him to pursue the Science, Technology and International Affairs program at Georgetown.
“It’s very different from what I would have been doing, and I’m so glad for that,” he said.
Greg Miller (SFS ’14) spent a year in Blagoveshchensk, Russia, studying Russian at the local university. He said that his gap year instilled an intrepidness that has helped him to maximize his time at Georgetown.
“The most valuable thing I learned was to never say no, to always go out there and try new things. This has meant that at Georgetown I’ve taken advantage of so many opportunities and lived life to the fullest,” Miller said.
While students who took gap years were positive about their experiences, they highlighted several challenges and said that gap years may not be a good choice for every student. Pincus highlighted the obstacles of his living situation.
“Being a guest for months is a really hard thing. I had to be on my game all the time. It’s dangerous not to be,” Pincus said. “I think it’s true that gap years aren’t for everyone.”
Sneeden said that the wide array of challenges posed by different gap year experiences means anyone can select an experience that will keep him or her comfortable — but only those who want to make the most out of their gap years should take them, he said.
“I think gap years are for anyone who wants to do them, because there is so much variety to what you can do, but if you aren’t ambitious, plan poorly and just lose the year doing nothing, you’re obviously going to be miserable and not take anything away from it,” he said.
While students said the transition from their gap year to the freshman class at Georgetown went more smoothly than expected, they cited certain challenges.
Ivy Otradovec (COL ’14), who visited every continent but one during her gap year, found it difficult to adjust to the structured, regimented lifestyle at Georgetown after a year of freedom.
“I wasn’t used to having any routine or regime. If I loved it somewhere, I could chill there for a month. Suddenly I come here and there’s a random institution trying to enforce deadlines and routines and hours, right down to when the dining hall is open and closed. It seemed insane,” she said.
Pincus said that the contrast between the experiential learning of his gap year and day-to-day classroom life at Georgetown can prove
challenging.
“I get bouts of feeling that I’m not doing anything important here,” he said. “But there’s an absolute value in being in an academic setting, and I see classroom learning in a completely different way.”
Rounds said he was nervous about coming to Georgetown after a year spent without tests or exams, but the transition was smoother than expected because of the intensive nature of his gap year program.
“While I was traveling I had a pretty rigorous curriculum. I was reading as much as I am at Georgetown now, so I was prepared for the academics here,” he said.
Pincus expressed concern that gap years are presented as a less safe path than the traditional one, especially by high school guidance counselors, even if they yield positive results.
“What concerns me is that there are many more people who could manage taking a gap year and could benefit tremendously but don’t do it because guidance counselors in high school present it as a risk,” he said.
While Georgetown supported his decision to take a gap year, Pincus said universities should be more open in backing the option.
“Georgetown should recommend that incoming freshmen do gap years. It definitely doesn’t detract from the college experience at all. It actually adds to it so much,” Miller said.

“The most valuable thing I learned was to never say no, to always go out there and try new things. This has meant that at Georgetown I’ve taken advantage of so many opportunities and lived life to the fullest,” Miller said.
While students who took gap years were positive about their experiences, they highlighted several challenges and said that gap years may not be a good choice for every student. Pincus highlighted the obstacles of his living situation.
“Being a guest for months is a really hard thing. I had to be on my game all the time. It’s dangerous not to be,” Pincus said. “I think it’s true that gap years aren’t for everyone.”
Sneeden said that the wide array of challenges posed by different gap year experiences means anyone can select an experience that will keep him or her comfortable — but only those who want to make the most out of their gap years should take them, he said.
“I think gap years are for anyone who wants to do them, because there is so much variety to what you can do, but if you aren’t ambitious, plan poorly and just lose the year doing nothing, you’re obviously going to be miserable and not take anything away from it,” he said.
While students said the transition from their gap year to the freshman class at Georgetown went more smoothly than expected, they cited certain challenges.
Ivy Otradovec (COL ’14), who visited every continent but one during her gap year, found it difficult to adjust to the structured, regimented lifestyle at Georgetown after a year of freedom.
“I wasn’t used to having any routine or regime. If I loved it somewhere, I could chill there for a month. Suddenly I come here and there’s a random institution trying to enforce deadlines and routines and hours, right down to when the dining hall is open and closed. It seemed insane,” she said.
Pincus said that the contrast between the experiential learning of his gap year and day-to-day classroom life at Georgetown can prove challenging.
“I get bouts of feeling that I’m not doing anything important here,” he said. “But there’s an absolute value in being in an academic setting, and I see classroom learning in a completely different way.”
Rounds said he was nervous about coming to Georgetown after a year spent without tests or exams, but the transition was smoother than expected because of the intensive nature of his gap year program.
“While I was traveling I had a pretty rigorous curriculum. I was reading as much as I am at Georgetown now, so I was prepared for the academics here,” he said.
Pincus expressed concern that gap years are presented as a less safe path than the traditional one, especially by high school guidance counselors, even if they yield positive results.
“What concerns me is that there are many more people who could manage taking a gap year and could benefit tremendously but don’t do it because guidance counselors in high school present it as a risk,” he said.
While Georgetown supported his decision to take a gap year, Pincus said universities should be more open in backing the option.
“Georgetown should recommend that incoming freshmen do gap years. It definitely doesn’t detract from the college experience at all. It actually adds to it so much,” Miller said.

Nightly Noms, a bakery staffed entirely by students, is trying to satisfy the cravings that O’Donovan Hall late night and The Corp’s cookies cannot.
Since its launch a year ago, the company co-founded by Elizabeth Sabol-Jones (COL ’13) has since developed the variety of goods it offers as well as its operation schedule.
The company delivers homemade treats around the campus community every Wednesday night. Nightly Noms largely operates from orders through the company’s website, which also features reviews and original recipes.
“I wanted to give the students an opportunity to utilize their resources, as well as to not feel so restricted to the on campus dining options,” Sabol-Jones said.
Customers generally order online, and Nightly Noms’ small staff delivers the treats to all Georgetown campus buildings every Wednesday night between 10 p.m. and 12 a.m. Student customers said that the local focus of Nightly Noms was part of its appeal.
“Ordering is really easy, and everything is delicious. I know for a fact that everything is always really good,” James Pickens (COL ’12) said. “It’s great because you order something warm, and it is still warm by the time it is delivered to you.”
A portion of each week’s profits is donated to Operation Smile, a charity devoted to performing reconstructive surgery for impoverished children born with facial deformities. Nightly Noms recently funded two “smiles” from the profits made during the fall semester.
“It is wonderful to be able to participate in the fundraising for an operation that these children would otherwise not be able to afford,” Sabol-Jones said.
Nightly Noms’ customers have also used the company’s services for philanthropic means.
“One boy last week ordered two dozen cookies for me to distribute to all of the late-night swipe desk guards,” Sabol-Jones said.
Sabol-Jones was inspired to found  the bakery after receiving high praise for the banana bread that she brought to a meeting of the Compass Fellows, a campus social entrepreneurship group.
“Not only did I enjoy the creative part of throwing things together to make something new and delicious, but I also loved the way that food and my baking brought people together to socialize and enjoy whatever I had decided to make on a whim,” Sabol-Jones said.
She established Nightly Noms as a company after deciding that she could not continue to fund her baking hobby independently.
Sabol-Jones plans to re-structure the company’s blog in order to share new elements of cuisine she will experience in China, where she will be studying abroad in the fall. She is also hoping to increase the size of her company by employing two new bakers and developing new recipes to become a larger presence on campus. The company is currently staffed by Sabol-Jones, Sarah Fox (COL ’13) and Rachel Hochstetler (COL ’13), and all three have been integral in the delivery process.
Nightly Noms also hopes to break into the tech savvy market on the Hilltop by placing CR codes, digitalized blocks that smart phones can recognize as a website, around campus for students to order on the spot.

Each of the District’s eight wards will be redrawn by Dec. 31 based on recently released census data.
Discussion about the redistricting and plans for shifting ward borders has already begun.
Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses, D.C.’s Ward 2, which is home to Georgetown as well as The George Washington University and Dupont Circle, experienced the greatest population spike in the District, gaining 11,046 people according to data recorded from the 2010 census. Washington, D.C. as a whole gained 29,664 people, marking a 5.2 percent population increase.
According to the website of the U.S. Census Bureau, census data are used specifically for redefining state legislative districts.
Kevin Stogner, a member of Ward 2 D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans’ staff, said that as of now there are many ways in which the redistricting could occur.
“Right now, there are dozens and dozens of scenarios. The only real rule is that boundaries have to be contiguous with themselves along with being no more than 5 percent above or below the median numbers,” Stogner said.
The D.C. Office of Zoning specifies that each ward should contain the same number of residents. Redistricting of each ward will follow due to changes in the population’s distribution demonstrated by the 2010 census. According to Stogner, Ward 2 will need to shrink while Ward 7, the easternmost part of the city, and Ward 8 in the southeast, must expand.
D.C. Council Chairman Kwame Brown announced that Evans and at-large Councilmember Michael Brown will co-chair the committee charged with redrawing ward boundaries, according to the Washington Examiner.
Formal hearings about redistricting will be held at least once during the day and once in the evening during the week of April 21, Stogner said. The purpose of these is to allow the public to contribute to the redistricting process.
“At this point the goal is to see what the positions are and get public input. We’ll start making decisions after we see what the options are,” Stogner said.
Stogner declined to comment on the reason for Ward 2’s growth in population, but Evans told The GW Hatchet that he wasn’t surprised about the ward’s population jump due to the rising popularity of the Dupont, Chinatown and Logan Circle areas.
Ward boundaries must be redrawn by July 14, according to the Hatchet. After that, the committee will begin working on altering the areas of the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, single member districts and voting precincts, and the whole process must be finished by Dec. 31, according to The Hatchet.

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke called for an uptick in federal funding of high-priority scientific research in an address Monday morning.
His remarks, delivered to a packed Lohrfink Auditorium, kicked off a two-day conference titled, “New Building Blocks for Jobs and Economic Growth,” which was sponsored by the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Athena Alliance, The Conference Board, the Kauffman Foundation and United States National Academies.
The conference addressed the government’s role in research and development and supporting American innovation.
“The tendency of the market to supply too little of certain types of research and development provides a rationale for government action,” Bernanke said.
His remarks set the tone for the conference’s panel discussions on topics like job creation, economic development and the future of American competitiveness.
Bernanke said that government support tools such as direct funding to research centers, grants to universities and individuals, contracts for specific studies and tax credits should be tailored to the projects they are supporting to obtain the best results.
Since the 1980s, the level of public spending on this type of research in the United States has fallen in comparison to the private sector’s efforts. More money has also flowed to applied research than to basic research.
Bernanke cautioned against neglecting the latter, as this results in an environment that lacks basic catalysts for change.
“The Internet revolution of the 1990s was based on scientific investments made in the 1970s and 1980s, and today’s widespread commercialization of biotechnology was based in part on key research findings developed in the 1950s,” he said. “Governments that choose to provide support for [research and development] are likely to get better results if that support is stable and long-term oriented, avoiding a pattern of ‘feast and famine.'”
According to Bernanke, the impressive impacts of innovation on economic growth and the many successes of government funding in research and development justify a call for increased spending in this area.
“Studies suggest that technological progress and the accumulation of intangible capital have together accounted for well over half of the increase in output per hour in the United States during the past several decades,” he said.
Bernanke also focused on the ever-increasing need for highly skilled, highly educated workers in today’s research-driven economy, advocating for greater government support for students pursuing science and engineering degrees.
The Fed chairman also addressed the effects of globalization on innovation.
According to Bernanke, the United States has been the global leader in innovation in research for much of the last century and, despite rising research and development spending by nations such as China and India, he sees American dominance in the field continuing.
At the same time, Bernanke emphasized the cooperative nature of research.
“In a globalized economy, product and process innovations in one country can lead to employment opportunities and improved goods and services around the world,” he said.

Beneath the famous Friendship Archway at H and 7th Streets lies the entrance to one of the District’s mostwellknown and culturally inspired neighborhoods, Chinatown. Only blocks away from the Verizon Center, the district is most visited for its restaurants and annual parade commemorating the Chinese New Year.
Each year, Chinatown celebrates the new year holiday with a parade, Chinese Dragon Dances, live musical performances and a host of other activities. The Chinese New Year is a 15-day celebration which begins with the New Moon on the first day of the new year and ends on the full moon two weeks later. This year, the new year will fall on Feb. 3. Keep in mind that during the festivities, it is customary for both performers and spectators to wear red, a color which is believed to aid in warding off evil spirits.
Chinatown spans nearly five blocks and contains approximately 20 Chinese, Asian and Asian-inspired restaurants, all within walking distance. While the neighborhood has recently played host to an increasing number of American chains such as Starbucks, Hooters, McCormick & Schmick’s and Legal Seafoods, it still maintains a firm grip on its Asian roots.
Today, many of its Asian restaurants are family-owned and operated. Of note is Ping Pong Dim Sum on 7th Street. Despite the restaurant’s seemingly informal name, Ping Pong is actually an upscale venue, offering an extensive menu of dim sum or, in Ping Pong’s words, “little steamed parcels ofdeliciousness.” These range from traditional dishes such as spicy pork and seafood dumplings to those better suited to the more intrepid, such as black prawn dumplings in black squid ink pastry.
Wok & Roll is another restaurant worth a visit, representing both them area’s Asian culture as well as the American history that D.C. is known for: The restaurant occupies a house which once served as the meeting place for John Wilkes Booth and his fellow conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in nearby Ford’s Theatre. Alongside this heaping slice of Americana, the restaurant serves the best of both Japanese and Chinese cuisine, including Peking Duck, Soft Shell Crab and a variety of sushi during happy hour from Monday to Friday from 4 to 7 p.m.
After a basketball game this season, stop in for happy hour at Wok & Roll, dim sum at Ping Pong, or try any one of the Chinese dives beneath the famous Friendship Archway. A couple caveats: dining in this area can be pricey, and the surrounding neighborhood is dicey, especially at night. The unique culinary and cultural delights to be found here outweigh whatever reservations you may still have, however. Forget it, Jake. It’s Chinatown.

It’s Tuesday night, and Geraldine Miranda (SFS ’13) waves goodbye to the van that has dropped her off in front of the small apartment in Chinatown where she tutors twice a week.
She knocks on the door, and her two tutees, Johnny, age seven, and Danny, age nine, run to open it; shouting her name as she enters the apartment.
As part of the D.C. Schools Project, one of the title programs of the Center for Social Justice, Miranda is just one of the 200 Georgetown students who go out into the District weekly to tutor students in need of extra help. In the 27 years since its inception, the program has risen in popularity, exploding from 15 students to its current membership. For volunteers, the program has become an invaluable part of their lives as they teach — and learn — from their tutees.
“I’m making a personal and tangible difference in my tutees’ lives that the D.C. public school [system] does not provide,” Rebecca Yang (SFS ’12) said.
Offering academic support for kids from low-income backgrounds who need support beyond what their public schools can offer, Georgetown students can provide the extra tutoring to kick-start these students’ academic success.
“Schools love us,” DCSP’s Interim Director Carlos Ojeda (MSB ’11) said. “They want us to keep coming.”
Ojeda pointed out, however, that Georgetown students themselves have a lot to gain from the program.
“Georgetown is a bubble. It’s very, very different than the outside world. Going out and seeing the rest of D.C. will not only raise your awareness of social issues, but can prepare students for the real world,” he said.
Student Coordinator Liliana Pichardo (MSB ’12) echoed his sentiments.
“[The program] is a great way to get off campus and really learn about immigration issues, the public school system, and what’s going on in other cultures. It’s an eye-opening experience,” she said.
But the program has its share of complications, mainly stemming from its lack of transportation resources. Ojeda said that the program shares buses with the entire Center for Social Justice, which limits the number of buses available exclusively to DCSP.
“If [the buses] are full, we just can’t help more people,” he said. “I think with the right leadership and more resources, we can continue to grow.”
Miranda herself ran into transportation issues her first two years in the program.
Though she was eager to take part in DCSP when she arrived on campus her freshman year, Miranda, who uses a wheelchair, was disappointed to find that the CSJ did not have a handicap accessible van in light of their van shortages. For her first two years at Georgetown, Miranda could only take part in the project’s on-campus programs.
Still, she was determined to work with her tutees in their own homes.
“I really wanted to go out and teach students in their homes, where they feel comfortable. I wanted that to be possible,” she said.
Last year, at Miranda’s urging, university officials secured the wheelchair-accessible van that transports her to Johnny and Danny’s apartment each week.
At Tuesday night’s session, both boys competed fiercely in a game of vocabulary bingo. Afterward, she read to them from “The Magic School Bus” and assigned them vocabulary exercises for the following week.
On the ride home, Miranda boasted about the boys’ improvements, visibly excited as she described the advanced material that Johnny was reading and Danny’s growing confidence in his abilities.
Just like Miranda, Yang spoke to the visible impact she sees in the kids’ academic progress.
“A lot of my students get lost in the cracks, and I feel like I can bring them back up again, little by little.”

John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79) stepped modestly up to the podium a decade ago to address over 2,000 faculty, staff, students and alumni gathered there to honor him.
“Good afternoon, and thank you. It is a profound honor to accept this responsibility today as the 48th president of Georgetown University,” the newly inaugurated president said.
Ten years later, DeGioia has overseen the largest expansion of campus facilities in university history. From establishing auxiliary campuses both across the river in Virginia and halfway around the globe in the Middle East, to overseeing an over 50 percent growth in the university endowment and strengthening many of its academic disciplines from business to regional studies, DeGioia has left his mark on the past decade.
“President DeGioia’s leadership has built upon the foundations of excellence and strategic growth that his predecessors have laid down,” said Dan Porterfield (CAS ’83), a close friend to DeGioia and former senior vice president for strategic development.
LOOKING OUT FROM WITHIN
Much about DeGioia is unique in Georgetown history. He is the first lay president of a Jesuit university in America, breaking the line of 47 ordained predecessors. Consequently, he is the first to have a family of his own, with his wife, Theresa, and young son, J.T.
“He really was a major forerunner in showing the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities that a layperson could lead a Catholic institution with fidelity to its religious mission,” Porterfield said.
Despite the non-traditional choice by the board of directors, DeGioia gained the backing of the majority of the community almost immediately; his reputation as a deft administrator preceded him.
Porterfield recalled that there was unanimity among the Jesuits on the board of directors about the choice.
“Fr. Brian McDermont, S.J., said at the time, speaking for the Jesuits on the board of directors, that they believed Jack DeGioia was a ‘providential decision for the next president,'” Porterfield said.
Before his appointment, DeGioia had spent his entire professional life on the Hilltop. After receiving his diploma in 1979, he took a job as hall director in New South Hall. In 1982, he began work as an assistant to former University President Timothy S. Healy, S.J.
He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming dean of student affairs as a 28-year-old in 1985. He was appointed associate vice president and chief administrative officer for the main campus in 1992.
In 1998, former University President Leo J. O’Donovan, S.J. (CAS ’56), put him in charge of fixing the finances of Georgetown University Medical Center, giving DeGioia the title of senior vice president.
Three years later, when it came time for a search committee to choose the next president of the nation’s oldest Catholic university, its members settled on DeGioia. Leaders were impressed with his work negotiating a complex financial deal to sell the clinical operations of GUMC to MedStar while retaining the academic institution of the medical school.
DeGioia’s long tenure on the Hilltop also made him a logical fit for a leader.
“He came to the job with exquisite experience. … I think at the time of his election he knew more about Georgetown University than anyone but God,” Fr. Otto Hentz, S.J., said.
In-depth knowledge of his alma mater gave him the ability to manage and transform the institution effectively. But Special Assistant to the President for China Affairs Dennis McManus, S.J., commented that over 35 years at Georgetown has not boxed in DeGioia’s perspective. Hentz agreed.
“People wondered that since all his years had been at Georgetown, he might be narrowly focused, but the opposite is just the case,” Hentz said. “His vision is very broad.”
According to Hentz, one of DeGioia’s greatest strengths is his hiring of quality staff to manage the complex operations of the university.
“My impression is that he’s an effective administrator because he hires effective administrators. What amazes me is how much he is on top of all that’s going on at the university,” he said.
PRESERVING A JESUIT IDENTITY
Ten years later it seems that any question of DeGioia’s commitment to the university’s Jesuit and Catholic identity has all but disappeared. According to McManus, of all the achievements the president has made over his 10 years, one of the greatest has been the strengthening and rejuvenation of Georgetown’s Jesuit character.
Current Vice President of Mission and Ministry Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (COL ’88), agreed that DeGioia has carried on the founding principles of the university.
“He has been very intentional about promoting the Catholic and Jesuit character,” O’Brien said.
Hentz explained that, being Jesuits, many of DeGioia’s predecessors became complacent with the school’s identity.
“In the ’50s and even the ’60s, we sort of took it for granted. There’s no cruise control in these matters,” he said. “In some ways, his commitment to the Catholic, Jesuit identity of Georgetown is more impressive precisely because he is not a Jesuit.”
As the first lay president, DeGioia engaged actively in promoting the ideals of the order. He instituted seminars on Ignatian spirituality for senior administrators and the Board of Trustees to help teach the leaders of Georgetown what it meant to be a Catholic and Jesuit university.
In 2003, DeGioia instituted the Office of Mission and Ministry to augment his efforts to preserve the university’s spiritual heritage. He has consistently chosen a Jesuit to fill that role — the singular priest in the senior administration hierarchy.
Those close to DeGioia emphasized that he personally is deeply ingrained in the Catholic spirituality of the order. He has twice made the full 30-day journey of the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises, the backbone of Jesuit spirituality, according to O’Brien.
Out of his active pursuit of the university’s traditional heritage has come an enhanced commitment to interreligious dialogue. Under DeGioia, multiple conferences have drawn religious leaders from around the world to campus to discuss global faith interactions and understanding.
He also makes a trip to Rome every year to meet with the superior general of the Society of Jesus, the leader of the Jesuits, as well as leaders from the Vatican. Stemming from his conversations with Jesuit leaders have come some of his plans for Georgetown’s international engagement.
“Our education must be put in service to the world,” O’Brien said. “It is both our goal and our way of operating.”
LEADING AN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
The extension of the university into the global sphere has been one of the most significant developments of DeGioia’s term. Porterfield drew a connection between DeGioia’s work worldwide to former President Healy’s work nationally. Healy is credited with transforming Georgetown from a local institution to a national center of higher education. Porterfield said DeGioia engineered a similar change from a national to international university.
The past 10 years have seen an unprecedented increase in international engagement. Georgetown opened a branch of its School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar in 2005. It has made key investments in partnerships with both India and Israel, as well as in China, a process that culminated in a high-profile trip by the men’s basketball team to that country this summer.
McManus noted that DeGioia’s work in the international sphere presented a vastly different set of challenges from Healy’s national development.
“It’s a very different world. It’s a very diverse world,” McManus said. “When you try to go global you not only have the issue of languages, but you have discrepancies in levels of socioeconomic development.”
Porterfield postulated that the university still had a lot to discover about its international engagement.
“It’s not clear what will define institutions as global,” Porterfield said. “Out of a sheer force of conviction that it would empower Georgetown … for future generations to develop global relationships now … he was committed to building the relationship because he saw the long-term strategic value.”
“A different president might not have chosen to do that work,” Porterfield added.
GROWTH ON THE HOMEFRONT
Back on the main campus, DeGioia has overseen impressive growth on the Hilltop. With the building of the Southwest Quad, Rafik B. Hariri Building, Davis Performing Arts Center and the under-construction New Science Center, Georgetown will complete the largest expansion of campus facilities in university history.
Overall university property has also expanded significantly with the opening of the Qatar campus, the Clarendon location for the School of Continuing Studies and the groundbreaking for the Calcagnini Contemplative Center in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Porterfield said that the new space has drastically improved student life on campus.
“[The expansion of facilities] drastically enhances the university’s competitiveness,” he said.
Under DeGioia’s leadership, the U.S. News and World Report ranking has stayed fairly constant from 23 in 2001 to 22 in 2011, rising to 21 at its highest. He also worked extensively to shore up university finances in order to facilitate the university’s growth.
“Clearly his focus in stabilizing the financial platform of the university has been a priority,” said Erik Smulson, vice president for public affairs and senior adviser to the president. “It gave confidence to some of our alumni and donors that we would be a good manager of the funds that they were willing to give us.”
In 2004, the university created the Investment Office and appointed a the first chief investment officer to oversee the growth of Georgetown’s endowment.
Since DeGioia took office in 2001, the endowment has grown over 50 percent to top $1 billion. This remains modest with respect to peer institutions, but growth continues to offset operating costs and provide additional financial stability.
Under DeGioia, a $1 billion fundraising campaign was completed in 2003. At the end of this month, another $1.5 billion capital campaign, which has already hit its halfway mark, will enter its public phase.
Solidifying the financial base was necessary for one of DeGioia’s other main priorities to become possible: Meeting the full need of all applicants, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
“The first pillar of the [capital] campaign is scholarships,” Smulson said. “He recognizes that making institutions of higher education affordable for students from all economic backgrounds is a key priority.”
ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY
Amid the turmoil of the ongoing campus plan battle, DeGioia has experience on his side.
This is his second time as president encountering opposition from the surrounding community. He inherited a contentious situation with the 2000 Campus Plan, which was ultimately resolved in court in 2003. He also played a significant role in his position as a senior administrator during the 1990 Campus Plan proceedings.
The DeGioia administration has made a conscious effort to play a positive role in the District and its surrounding areas. “Our engagement in the city … has never been greater,” Smulson said.
According to Smulson, both the construction of the Southwest Quadrangle, which allowed more students to live in campus residences, and the Ward 7 initiative, which is a partnership between Georgetown and the Meyers Institute for College Prep, have been significant investments in improving neighborhood relations.
But for all his work at Georgetown and around the globe, many administrators emphasize a single point: DeGioia’s commitment to the undergraduate experience.
“His ability to translate to faculty and senior leaders why we value the development of undergraduates … has very significantly affected choices that senior leaders make in how to respond to student needs,” Porterfield said.
DeGioia has remained active in the academy, teaching an Ignatius Seminar for freshmen in the College. According to Smulson, who served as his chief of staff for four years, his class and weekly office hours are some of the most important events on his calendar.
However, some students feel that DeGioia could engage more on campus.
Brad Hilson (COL ’12) echoed that sentiment. “I never see him on campus. I’ve been here for three and a half years now and I never see him … I don’t think he’s a very student-oriented person.”
A JUGGLING ACT
For a university president, however, the job is much more than just community relations and fundraising campaigns. Those close to him say that the non-stop commitment takes its toll and that DeGioia doesn’t give an inch.
“There is no person in this university, not one, who would ever tell you that when they were working with President DeGioia, they worked harder than him,” Porterfield said. “He has been a servant-leader in the role of president in support of Georgetown University and its people.”

While thousands of Georgetown hopefuls finalize their applications, over 5,000 members of the Alumni Ambassadors Program are gearing up to interview prospective members of the class of 2016.
“The interview adds another layer to the application and gives us a bit more insight into the applicant,” said Colleen Miltenberg, assistant director of undergraduate admissions and one of the program’s coordinators.
AAP, founded in 1964 with fewer than 400 interviewers, now includes members from all 50 states, ranging from six in Wyoming to the multitudes in the D.C. area.
Since its inception, the program has grown to become an integral part of Georgetown’s admissions process. In its founding year, AAP’s members interviewed 32 percent of the total applicant pool. But last admissions cycle, according to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, alumni interviewed more than 90 percent of applicants. AAP expects to match that number this year.
Robert Adelberg (C ’59), who has been involved with AAP interviewing since its inception, said that the program’s growth has not diminished its core mission — to bring the best students to the university.
“That was the way we, as alumni, could give back in the finest measure,” he said of the group’s founding. “We were picking the next generation to succeed us at Georgetown.”
Since joining the program, he has interviewed at least four applicants a year. In some seasons, his interviews number in the dozens.
 
MAKING THE CUT
According to Miltenberg, the AAP keeps alumni involved with their alma mater while fulfilling the university’s need for admissions interviewers.
“The AAP gives alumni a chance to stay connected to their communities, to local high schools and to us,” she said.
Most alumni who express interest in interviewing are assigned to a local chair. In regions with many more applications than interviewers, the admissions office actively seeks out alumni who can interview.
While Miltenberg said that no official criteria are used for selecting interviewers, undergraduate alumni are preferred over those who earned graduate degrees at Georgetown.
Interviewers are organized into 170 domestic and over 50 international committees. In the United States, committees are organized by geographic location and population. If the university receives many applications from a certain region, the AAP may create several committees in that area. In other locations, such as North Dakota and Wyoming, a single committee may serve the entire state.
Though Miltenberg could not provide the exact number of interviewers in each committee, she said that those in New York and Washington, D.C., are the largest, due to Georgetown’s high concentration of alumni in those regions.
She said the AAP committees in Dallas-Ft. Worth, Texas, Princeton, NJ., South Orange County, Calif. and San Jose, Calif., completed the largest number of interviews last year with over 240 applicants apiece.
Of all the international committees, the groups serving Great Britain and China interviewed the most prospective students in the Class of 2015 cycle.
HOYAS THROUGH AND THROUGH
AAP members span a broad range of age and experience: Some are well-established members of local communities and hold senior-level jobs in business, law or medicine, while others, like Elizabeth Griffin (COL ’05), are more recent graduates who wish to maintain their ties with the Hilltop.
After moving from Georgetown to Syracuse, N.Y., Griffin signed up for the program online when she heard last year that the committee in her region needed more interviewers.
“It’s definitely a great way to stay connected to your alma matter and talk to young people,” she said.
As a new member, Griffin said that she was required to attend an informal training session, where she was given sample questions to ask and informed of new programs on campus that she could discuss with applicants.
Kyle Pietrantonio (COL ’03) is entering his seventh season as an alumni interviewer in Atlanta. He plans to meet between five and seven applicants during this cycle.
According to Pietrantonio, the OA’s regional liaison for his area, Lia Glavin, visited the Atlanta committee to update them on changes to the admissions process and to review last year’s admissions results.
Pietrantonio said that the university’s support for AAP has grown since he first joined the organization.
“I would say that the level of support and guidance from the admissions office has improved,” he said, adding that the process is faster now that interviewers are authorized to submit reports over the Internet.
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INTERVIEW
Kimberly Snow (COL ’77), co-director of the Orlando, Fla. committee, said that members do not use a set script or list of questions when conducting interviews.
“We’re not really given any [detailed] training. They just showed you a couple sample interviews, and that was it,” she said. “You really had to mold your own way of interviewing from there, and some interviewers are better than others.”
Snow, who has been an AAP member for almost 30 years, said that interviewing is not as easy as it might seem.
“It’s particularly difficult here in the South, because not many people get accepted,” she said. “I have interviewers in my committee who have been working for 15 or 20 years and have not had one of their applicants get into Georgetown. It’s very frustrating for them.”
For many alumni, like Shana Bynon (SFS ’93), this frustration is eclipsed by a sense of service and commitment to the university.
“I find it pretty rewarding, doing the interviews,” she said. “I really enjoy being connected to campus through the applicants every year.”
Bynon, who volunteers for the Baltimore committee, said the five to seven interviews that she completes a year allow her to promote the university’s ideals.
“I remember my alumni interview. It was one of the things I really liked about applying to Georgetown,” she said.
After 45 years of interviews, Adelberg said that he still finds the process to be incredibly enriching.
“If you believe in what your school stands for, it’s the finest form of salesmanship for the next generation that comes along,” he said.

It was intended to be an easy, diplomatic trip to promote goodwill between the world’s two superpowers and to provide the Georgetown men’s basketball team with some early exhibition games.
Instead, the journey proved as difficult as scaling the Great Wall.
A violent, bench-clearing, game-ending brawl in a contest against the Chinese Basketball Association’s Bayi Rockets cast a massive shadow over the Hoyas’ tour of China this summer. Fists, feet and chairs flew as the sporting representative of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army came to blows with one of the United States’ premier college teams.
The brawl raised doubts about everything from Georgetown’s toughness to the stability of Sino-Americanrelations in the 21st century. And while Head Coach John Thompson III and the Hoyas realized the seriousness of the situation, most found a silver lining.
“Being a part of that, going through that experience, I do think that has helped expedite the coming-together process of this team,” Thompson III said. “Quite literally, they realize that you’ve got to have each other’s back.”
Thompson III was not the only one to recognize the potential benefits of an otherwise ugly situation. Senior center Henry Sims was among several Hoyas who echoed the coach’s assertion that the fight had, in fact, brought the team closer together.
“It’s good to know somebody’s in your corner if something goes down,” Sims said.
Many questions remain about the nature of the fight. The grainy internet videos leaked from the event seem to expose the Rockets as the primary instigators of violence, and the foul shot numbers indicate a game blatantly refereed in favor of the home team. Still, the situation was resolved rapidly and diplomatically with Georgetown extending an olive branch the morning after the melee.
Although the brawl was handled as well as could be expected from a public relations perspective, it still overshadowed an otherwise successful tour. The Hoyaswon every game they finished — no small feat, considering that they played exclusively professional teams — by an average of nearly 20 points per game.
The Blue and Gray showed off a balanced scoring attack with several players posting double figures in each game but no one eclipsing the 20-point mark. Seasoned veterans like junior forward Hollis Thompson and senior guard Jason Clark shared the scoring load with two highly touted incoming freshmen, forward Otto Porter and guard JabrilTrawick. Perhaps the most impressive performance came in the Hoyas’ first game, when they played against the ShanxiZhongyu Brave Dragons. Porter led six players in double figures with 16 points, and Georgetown nearly reached the century mark in a 98-81 victory.
The team appeared to enjoy themselves off the court, touring the Great Wall, Old Shanghai and Tiananmen Square, among other sites. Thompson also hosted a clinic for Chinese high school coaches at the Nike Festival of Sport.
“It was fun,” Clark said. “It was an experience. We had a good time together, a good time spending time with each other.”
The Hoyas undoubtedly wish the fight with the Rockets hadn’t marred their trip, but the bonding experience against China’s physical professional teams will help to prepare them for play in the Big East — which, at least for this season, is still the toughest conference in basketball. For a young team missing several key players from last year, that experience was essential.
“We’re going to be much different this year, and we’re going to lean on the incoming guys a lot,” Coach Thompson said. “From that perspective, the trip was invaluable.”

Panelists, including Chinese pro-democracy dissident Wei Jingsheng, discussed the country’s human rights record and the implications of the university’s relationship with Chinese governmental organizations Wednesday night.
The panel, which took place in McShain Lounge, was cosponsored by the International Relations Club, the Lecture Fund and the Georgetown University Students Association. GUSA is spearheading an initiative for Georgetown to engage in dialogue with Chinese human rights activists and the Chinese government.
The event included Huang Ciping, a human rights activist who translated for Wei, as well as Amnesty International Director of Advocacy T. Kumar and Director of Georgetown’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, & World Affairs and associate professor Tom Banchoff. Fr. Steven Fields, S.J., monitored the spirited discussion.
Wei, who spent 18 years in Chinese prisons before being exiled to the United States, voiced criticism of his home country’s approach to human rights.
“In China, there is only one political party — the Communist Party — and no one can compete,” he said. “With only one party, human rights cannot be well respected,” he said.
Kumar added that half a million people are currently detained by the Chinese government, some for up to 40 years. Religious minorities are especially targeted, according to Kumar.
“No religion is allowed. Only the state-sponsored religion is accepted,” he said.
The most controversial topic of the evening was the Chinese government’s denial of a visa to Georgetown professor James Millward related to his contribution to a book concerning a Muslim area in China. Wei, Kumar and Huang criticized Georgetown’s lack of action on behalf of professor Millward.
“You do not have to be champions, but you must not do damage,” Kumar said. “Georgetown has damaged its own reputation.”
Banchoff defended Georgetown’s handling of the situation and relationship with Chinese governmental organizations, such as the State Administration of Religious Affairs.
“Principles are important, but we live in a complex world,” he said. “We shouldn’t put the relationship [between Georgetown and China] at stake for one scholar’s visa.”
Student opinions were somewhat divided about Chinese-U.S. relations. One student demanded to know what Wei had done for the Chinese people, aside from making speeches.
“You have mentioned that I have often criticized the Chinese government,” Wei said. “That is what I have done for the Chinese people.”
Other students came away with warmer feelings toward Wei.
“I thought he was hilarious,” Sophia Weng (MSB ’15) said. “He’s hoping for a change, and you can tell it through his words.”
The panel concluded on an optimistic note, when Wei was asked about the future of the regime in China.
“If they don’t reform, Chinese people will uprise,” Wei said. “The final conclusion is, China will change.”

Chinese fervor for American education is growing rapidly.
In the past year, the number of Chinese undergraduate and graduate students at Georgetown has jumped 35 percent to a new high of 342.
Coming from a country where education is highly prized, many students hope a Georgetown degree will gave them an edge in the competitive Chinese economy.
“There is definitely this talk in China that American education is better than Chinese education,” said Yongle Xue (COL ’14), who graduated from a Chinese high school.
“If you graduate from an American university, especially a prestigious American university, you will have more job opportunities.”
But for these students, the road to the Hilltop and their time on campus are strewn with unique difficulties. Whether they are struggling with immigration concerns or navigating a new social scene, these students face challenges that are both strikingly familiar and utterly foreign.
 
GETTING IN
In the last five years, the number of Chinese students applying to Georgetown as undergraduates has jumped from fewer than 100 in 2006 to more than 350 in the admissions cycle for the Class of 2015, according to James Colman, senior associate director at the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
In recent years, admission rates for students applying from Chinese high schools have ranged from the single digits to 20 percent, Colman said. But the overall trend is towards increasingly competitive rates as the applicant pool expands while the number of spots for Chinese applicants remains roughly the same.
“Although the number of applicants from China continues to grow, we are not seeking to change the mix of students admitted and enrolling at Georgetown,” he wrote in an email.
Language difficulties can be a major barrier to Georgetown hopefuls applying from high schools in China, who often have to compete with peers who attended English-language schools in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
“For those whose English language skills are sufficiently strong, I suspect that the admit rate has not changed dramatically,” Colman wrote. “The larger number of applicants coming from China often do not yet have the language skills needed to thrive at Georgetown. This may change over time, but there remains much headway to be made in English language instruction on the mainland.”
In addition to language issues, the idiosyncrasies of the application process may also present challenges.
The application’s personal statement can be difficult for Chinese students who may never have written such essays in school.
“Writing the essay is difficult because it’s different from the way we are used to writing,” Xue said.
Diana Bao (SFS ’15) re-wrote her statement seven or eight times before she felt comfortable submitting it. Bao turned to an agency for guidance in the application and essay-writing process.
“The agent that helped me is mostly like a college counselor at a U.S. high school,” she said.
But Xue said that for other students, there is a stigma associated with using outside resources to get help with applications.
“I don’t want other people to control my decisions,” she said. “Students who do their applications themselves don’t like those agencies.”
Applying to Georgetown from overseas poses logistical challenges, as well.
Letters take about two extra weeks to go through the international postal system, so even after Xue had been notified by schools via email, she was still waiting to hear whether she was accepted to Georgetown.
When her acceptance letter finally arrived, Bao wrote on the Chinese equivalent of Facebook, “I feel closer to my dreams.”
 
FINDING THEIR WAY
Accepted Chinese students lack many of the resources Americans take for granted. They can’t log on to their class Facebook page to connect with peers before the year begins, for example, because the social networking site is blocked by the Chinese government.
But they often have more pressing matters on their minds.
“They’re always worried about being stopped at the border and not being allowed in [to the U.S.],” said Helene Robertson, director of the International Scholars Division at the Office of International Programs. “Immigration status is a huge concern.”
Though this issue is beyond the scope of what the typical Georgetown student deals with, other challenges facing Chinese students are more familiar.
Many applicants struggle to pay Georgetown’s tuition, especially because the university does not provide substantial financial aid to international students.
According to Xue, many Chinese parents will spend a great deal of their savings to allow their children to come to America.
“Most Chinese parents are willing to give everything to their children,” Xue said. “But then you still have the psychological stress that you’re taking their money. It’s very unsettling.”
Bao had a similar experience. When another university offered her money, she almost gave up on her dream of going to Georgetown.
“[Financial issues] are the biggest thing for me and my family,” she said.
Students continue to struggle with finances even after they’ve made the decision to attend Georgetown.
“I know of some Chinese students who live multiple people to an apartment,” Robertson said. “It used to be they really struggled with the cost of living [in D.C.]”
Some Chinese students seek employment in the United States to ease the financial burden.
According to Robertson, a number of scholarship programs created by the Chinese government in recent years can help alleviate students’ financial concerns, and may help explain the recent enrollment spike.
“There is a huge official push to create partnerships with American universities,” she said.
MAKING A HOME ON THE HILLTOP
Once students arrive at Georgetown, the university provides a number of resources to help international students, including international pre-orientation and global living communities.
“We try to match them up with international ambassadors [and] that has become one of the best things that we offer,” Robertson said. “Even before they come here they have a chance to connect.”
Xue said these programs make a difference.
“The OIP definitely provides a lot of help,” she said. “They introduced us to American life and … resources on campus that we can use.”
Given that the number of Chinese students studying at Georgetown is larger than ever, the OIP is also considering developing a program to meet their specific needs, according to Robertson.
“It’s something that different offices on campus have started talking about to see what challenges we’re facing and how we can best help some students…fit more smoothly into the GU community,” she said.
But Robertson is concerned that many Chinese students don’t take advantage of the resources the university already offers.
“When they run into difficulty they don’t reach out for help,” she said.
Roberston also hoped that additional programs could help Chinese students adjust to the American style of teaching — a hard transition for some students.
“The way of education is really different,” Bao said, recalling how difficult it was to transition to Georgetown from Chinese classrooms, where students are not expected to voice their opinions.
“One reason more kids apply to study abroad … is because we don’t like the Chinese education,” she said. “But suddenly, when you are encouraged to talk, you don’t know what to say.”
The altered expectations can be difficult for many.
“Because participation counted in the grade, I had to raise my hand and talk. So for my English class, I always had my hand up and I just didn’t know what to say, but I knew I had to talk or I [would] have a bad grade,” Xue said.
Chinese students also face considerable challenges in adjusting to social differences across the cultures. While some mix easily with American students, other Chinese students find it easier to befriend others from China.
“There are a lot of cultural differences that need to be unpacked,” Robertson said.
“It’s easier for us to make friends with American students who are interested in Chinese culture,” Xue said. “Some of my best American friends speak fluent Chinese or are really into Chinese culture.”
Bao agreed.
“It is natural for us to have closer Chinese friends. We are from the same background. We can easily makes jokes to each other that nobody else understands,” she said.
But Robertson expressed concern about this phenomenon.
“They are an amazingly supportive community. They take care of each other … which is a way of finding a bit of home here, but it also keeps them from interacting with others.”
Yet in many ways, Chinese students face the same obstacles as their American peers.
“They struggle with the same things any Georgetown student struggles with,” Robertson said. “They’re a long way from home. They have the expectations of their families.”

The School of Foreign Service announced Tuesday that it will introduce two new Master of Arts degrees in hopes of giving students an edge in changing industries.
The Global Human Development and Asian Studies degrees will both begin to enroll students next fall and will be awarded for the first time in 2014.
The Global Human Development graduate program, which was approved last summer, will be open to 20 students.
“The program is trying to look forward [to] what the development challenges are going to be over the next 40 or 50 years,” Ann Van Dusen, interim director of the Global Human Development degree, said.
The program intends to help foster the practical skills needed for global development.
“It is a very applied and practitioner-oriented degree, which distinguishes it from many others,” Van Dusen said.
She added that she believes that businesses will begin to view an understanding of global development as crucial to success.
“It is going to be a relatively quick change from businesses looking at work in developing countries as sort of corporate responsibility — one step beyond charity — they are moving from that to seeing this as part of their business strategy,” she said.
The requirements of the program include courses in the economics and politics of development, project design and evaluation, financing, management and technology.
According to Van Dusen, one of the unique features of the degree, which is targeted at those who already have professional experience in development, is the required international work project between a student’s first and second year in the program.
“It will build [students’] skills as well as their networks,” she said.
The Master of Arts degree in Asian Studies will be housed at the National Resource Center for East Asia, which is funded by the U.S. Department of Education.
Victor Cha, the director of the new degree, believes the university can benefit from reaching out to China. University President John J. DeGioia has also made outreach to the region a priority.
“Georgetown is very interested in expanding its national and international profile on Asia,” Cha said. “The best way to do that is by having  a serious graduate degree program.”
According to Cha, the curriculum will give students a broad knowledge of Asia in addition to a focus on one or two of three specializations — politics and security, political economy and business or history and society.
Students will also learn Chinese, Japanese or Korean and, if they choose, a sub-regional specialization.
Cha believes the new degree is long overdue.
“So many people were coming here for years surprised that we didn’t have a graduate program on Asia,” he said. “We’re very happy to get this through the university.”

In the dead of night of May 2, 2011, two Blackhawk helicopters touched down outside a dilapidated house in the small city of Abbottabad, Pakistan. Upon landing, the team of Navy SEALs aboard moved quickly to execute their mission. In just under 40 minutes, the SEALs had completed their objective and vanished into the darkness.
Hours later, President Barack Obama addressed the nation, sharing the news that Osama Bin Laden had been killed. Families sat awestruck in front of their televisions, District-area students rushed to Pennsylvania Avenue to cheer, and collectively, the nation breathed a sigh of relief.
Steven Cortes, an analyst for CNBC’s “Fast Money,” graduated from Georgetown in 1994 and was one of the many surprised by the mission. Yet, as he sat at his home in Chicago that summer night, Cortes didn’t remain in awe for long. He reacted swiftly and bought up United States currency.
Most of Cortes’ financial colleagues and acquaintances quickly branded his investment as risky. The dollar’s Euro exchange rate hovered at a paltry .673, not far off historic lows precipitated by the 2008 financial crisis, and recent economic data had done little to assuage investors’ fears over the weakness of the nation and of its currency.
Cortes was defying mass opinion; he was going against the herd.
This was not the first time Cortes had invested against prevailing Wall Street sentiments, and it would certainly not be his last.
Ten months later, Cortes still holds the dollar, which has risen to an exchange rate of roughly 0.76 against the Euro. He took a risky chance and in less than a year, his investment had grown by nearly 15%.
“What SEAL Team Six did was remind the investing world that the reserve currency does in fact default to the world’s strongest military, and the United States pulled off an exercise that night which no other country on earth could even fathom,” explained Cortes to a Georgetown audience on Feb. 28. “Going secretly into a sovereign country that far from home, hitting a target, removing it and doing all of it successfully.”
Upon leaving the Hilltop in 1994, where he was a defensive lineman on the football team, a Baker Scholar and a candidate for the Rhodes scholarship, Cortes entered the world of investing.
For four years, Cortes worked for Prudential selling government bonds before branching off on his own to found Veracruz LLC in 1998. Today, he provides investment strategy for individual investors, contributes regularly to CNBC’s “Fast Money” and, most recently, he writes. This past December, Cortes published his first book — Against the Herd: 6 Contrarian Investment Strategies You Should Follow.
After years in the financial sector, Cortes began to see an alarming pattern. He explained, “The mainstream media, the financial press and Wall Street were often wrong in their thinking and leading investors down a dangerous path.” He believes this cohesion of opinion pushed investors to a dangerous herd mentality that was responsible for devastating financial bubbles, seen most recently in the U.S. housing seen most recently in the U.S. housing and technology sectors.
“As human beings, we are evolutionarily wired to seek safety in numbers,” he said. “And while that made a lot of sense while we were in some jungle or some forest trying to escape from predators, that psyche, that ingrained predilection is a serious problem when it comes to investing.”
Cortes soon developed into a self-described contrarian investor. Often at odds with the majority of financial pundits, his calculated skepticism over conventional wisdom has led Cortes to financial success, giving him experience that he now hopes to share.
Cortes visited Georgetown to lecture on his contrarian investment strategies discussed in his book Against the Herd. While he presents six contrarian challenges, Cortes’ focuses on what he perceives as a financial bubble in emerging markets.
Most analysts see emerging markets such as China as a prime area for growth in the coming decades. China has a strong government, ranks second in number of global billionaires, and boasts a massive population which provides inexpensive labor.
To Cortes, China’s “power” is a slowly crumbling facade. He believes investors are wrong in viewing China as a growing economic superpower and instead urges them to invest in a United States that is only beginning its reign of economic dominance.
While China is a wealthy country, as a whole it is an incredibly poor country akin even to parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Per capita, American income is over 10 times greater than Chinese and in a recent poll of China’s wealthiest citizens, 60% revealed plans to leave in the near future.
Cortes argued that China’s authoritarian government, once instrumental in economic success, has already started to inhibit growth. Inefficiencies in central planning are no more evident than in demographics. Because of China’s one child policy, a young female population necessary for continued demographic growth is nearly nonexistent.
Though China certainly does provide inexpensive labor, Cortes believes it lacks a more important component of growth: innovation. He argued, “There is no interest to protect property because they’re not creating any to protect. It is a culture of conformity not creativity.”
While Cortes’ arguments against Chinese supremacy were quite powerful themselves, one graduate student in the audience, who emigrated from China in the 1980s with his wife and children, boosted them even further. The student praised Cortes for his understanding of China’s reality and hoped that the author’s book and lecture would be a wake-up call for American policymakers and investors.
The truth about contrarian advice is that it is often only considered once it is too late.
Cortes hopes that these mistakes will not be repeated with China and other potentially destructive popular opinions. He expects that his book will allow his contrarian opinions to reach the right audience and create skepticism. From here though, it’s up to the American consumer to run with the herd or not.

Although Georgetown’s season ended in an all-too-familiar fashion — at the hands of a double-digit seed in the NCAA tournament — the feeling was undeniably different from past years.
Picked to finish 10th in the conference by Big East coaches in the preseason poll, the young Hoyas went 24-9, finishing fifth in conference thanks to a 12-6 record in Big East play. The reward for their stellar regular season was a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament’s Midwest Region and a matchup with Belmont, which the Blue and Gray won handily. The win broke an embarrassing three-game tournament losing streak for the program and was arguably the crowning achievement of a season that saw the Hoyas exceed the expectations of all but the most optimistic Georgetown fans.
And precisely because of the team’s relatively surprising success, the Hoyas’ heartbreaking 66-63 loss to NC State in the next round of the tournament was less disappointing than the upsets of years past. In the moment, as time expired and senior guard Jason Clark’s off-balance attempt at a game-tying three sailed past the rim, the result was upsetting. After all, the loss marked the fourth time in Georgetown’s last four tournament appearances that Head Coach John Thompson III’s team had been sent packing by a double-digit seed. But, in the big picture, the Hoyas had a season that can only be judged an unqualified success.
The Blue and Gray crushed their preseason expectations for the first time in five years, and got the tournament win that Clark and fellow senior Henry Sims so richly deserved. Beating the No. 14 seed Bruins before falling in the next round might not be a noteworthy accomplishment for most teams, but this year’s Hoyas were no ordinary No. 3 seed.
The burden of repeated postseason failures weighed heavily on the team, and this year’s iteration of the Blue and Gray wasn’t expected to even earn a chance to get rid of that baggage. So when the Hoyas finally won, the sense of relief was palpable.
“I think [there] was definitely a sense of urgency, not just for me but [for] the whole team,” Clark said after defeating Belmont. “We’ve known what we’ve done in the past. So it was a big thing for us to get this win today.”
“[We] finally got the monkey off our back,” said sophomore guard Markel Starks.
The groundwork for the success of the season was laid in China, as the team and the media noted throughout the year. The ugly preseason brawl with the Bayi Rockets may have gotten the Hoyas into the headlines for all the wrong reasons, but it bred a toughness and togetherness that no amount of practicing could have.
The regular season started normally enough, as Georgetown crushed Savannah State and UNC-Greensboro by a combined 70 points. A four-point loss to then-No. 14 Kansas in the first round of the Maui Invitational was the first indication that these Hoyas might be a little better than initially thought. When they beat then-No. 8 Memphis in the fifth-place game two days later, that suspicion was confirmed. Sims’ 24-point, eight-rebound, five-assist performance against the Tigers was an early sign of things to come for the Hoyas. The senior center enjoyed a breakout season after three largely ineffective years on the Hilltop.
Sims and the rest of the Hoyas kept rolling when they returned to the continental 48, ripping off nine straight wins after returning from Maui. By the time the winning streak ended on Jan. 7 against West Virginia, the Blue and Gray were no longer sneaking up on anyone. Ranked No. 9 in the country, thanks to impressive wins over top-25 foes Alabama, Louisville, Marquette — ranked No. 12, 4 and 20 respectively at the time of their losses to the Blue and Gray — plus a second defeat of Memphis, Georgetown had arrived on the national scene.
Unsurprisingly, the strength and depth of the Big East took its toll on the Hoyas, as they won ‘just’ nine of their last 15 regular-season games after taking 13 of their first 14. Arguably the worst moment of the season came during this stretch, when Seton Hall blew out Georgetown by 18 points in February. Worse still, Starks and Thompson III were reportedly involved in a heated argument as the team walked off the court. Starks was benched for the entirety of the next game — a 21-point thrashing of Villanova — and came off the bench for the rest of the year.
Starks’ replacement in the starting lineup in some ways epitomized the Hoyas’ year. Freshman forward Otto Porter came out of seemingly nowhere to lead the team in rebounds (6.7 per game) and contributed nearly 10 points per contest, providing an unexpected source of offense for Thompson III’s team. Porter’s considerable defensive impact was at least matched by freshman forward Greg Whittington, whose offensive capabilities became obvious only at the end of the year but who served as a defensive stopper for the Hoyas from day one. Those two, along with fellow freshmen Jabril Trawick and Mikael Hopkins, displayed maturity well beyond their years throughout the season and were vital to the team’s overachievement.
As for next year, they’ll be looked at to contribute even more, as the team’s three leading scorers are departing the Hilltop. Junior forward Hollis Thompson has declared for the NBA draft, while seniors Sims and Clark are set to graduate. Their leadership and scoring will be sorely missed next year, but, if nothing else, the returning Hoyas will have ample experience in defying expectations. If they duplicate the formula that brought them success this year — a swarming, stifling defense coupled with timely, efficient scoring — this space next year could very well be recapping a season that includes more than just one NCAA tournament win.

The School of Continuing Studies will consolidate its programs in a new center in the Gallery Place-Chinatown neighborhood scheduled to open in late 2013.
The university signed a lease today for four stories in an office building at 650 Massachusetts Ave., NW, which will house all of the SCS’s programs. The programs are currently spread between the main campus and a satellite location in Clarendon, Va.
In the past three years, the SCS has increased its enrollment by about 360 percent. A new location for the SCS has long been a goal of the university and will allow it to continue to expand in the coming years, beginning with the addition of two new master’s programs in 2013 in urban and regional planning and emergency and disaster management.
“For nearly two years SCS has worked to find a new home that achieves our vision for a state-of-the-art learning environment for our community of students and professionals,” University President John J. DeGioia wrote in an email to the university community. “This milestone for SCS reflects our commitment to providing an education marked by rigor, excellence, collaboration and innovation.”
The university also committed to finding a new location to house 1,000 SCS students as part of the negotiations regarding the 2010 Campus Plan.
According to a university statement, the 91,000-square foot property, termed “Georgetown Downtown” by the university, is slated to include administrative offices, classrooms, group study rooms, meeting spaces, a contemplative space, media and library resource centers and a cafe. The university is working with New York-based firm STUDIOS Architecture to redesign the space.
The university’s most recent financial plan estimated that the new space would cost about $11.5 million between fiscal years 2011 and 2013, but it is unclear what the lease will cost.

KAYLA NOGUCHI/THE HOYAJames Mann (pictured) and Tom Hamburger, both writers and former journalists, spoke about the fast-evolving dynamics of the presidential race at an event in the Mortara Center Tuesday.Author James Mann and The Washington Post correspondent Tom Hamburger discussed politics, foreign policy and the presidential race in Georgetown’s Mortara Center for International Studies Tuesday afternoon.
Hamburger, a reporter for The Post’s national desk and a former writer for the Los Angeles Times, summarized the presidential campaign and explained why it has become a closer race in the most recent weeks.
“A few weeks ago, there was a feeling that Mitt Romney was so full of bombast and had been so successfully caricatured as a greedy titan of Wall Street, and the economic numbers were trending Barack Obama’s way, that political reporters began to wonder if the presidential election was really over — that we should put our attention more to Congressional races,” Hamburger said.
However, Hamburger noted that during the final month before the presidential election, there often is an October surprise, a pivotal development that occurs late in the race.
“This year, the October surprise was what some were referring to as the ‘Obama no-show’ in the [first] debate,” Hamburger said. “I think that the Obama performance in that debate contributed to what I would call a sense of unease.”
Hamburger argued that despite some signs of economic recovery, such as the drop in the national unemployment rate, there is still a sense of anxiety among Americans about the nation’s status internationally.
 “It’s rather not a specific economic unease as much as a subtle and diffuse one that does relate to America’s place in the world,” he said.
According to Mann, an author-in-residence at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, a former reporter for the Los Angeles Times and author of several books on politics and foreign policy, the renewed focus on international issues is a Romney campaign strategy.
“My own theory is that [Romney is] talking about foreign policy now as a stand-in for leadership,” Mann said. “He’s talking about these issues in a way that will show he is a strong leader, and people can then transfer [that idea] over to the economy.”
Mann added that domestic issues still hold sway with the electorate.
“I’m certain that the polls show that the public cares multiple times more about the domestic economy and jobs than it does about the consulate in Benghazi,” Mann said, referring to the attack on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya last month that killed American Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
Mann also spoke about his most recent book, “The Obamians, which explores President Obama’s prediction of the country’s long-term future. In his book, Mann divides the Obama campaign team into three different generations: the post-Vietnam generation, the post-Cold War generation of the 1990s, and the “Obamians” — those who came of age in the 2000s.
“The Obamians represent an effort to redo American strategy, to have a lighter footprint in the world, to no longer act assuming that America is and always will have a position of primacy in the world,” Mann said. “That the day will come when the United States is not necessarily the most powerful nation in the world, and … the country needs to start getting ready for it.”
Both speakers discussed the importance of China as a debate topic.
Mann noted that both President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wanted to label China as a currency manipulator during their presidential campaigns in 2008 but did not follow through once in office.
“They took office, and they passed up one chance after another to do that because the belief was that China would take umbrage and there would be a trade war,” Mann said.
In Tuesday’s debate, Gov. Romney reiterated his promise to label China a currency manipulator. However, Mann challenged the effectiveness of his proposed action.
“What [Gov. Romney] doesn’t say is that actually, for all this talk from three candidates, declaring China a currency manipulator does not by itself change anything,” Mann said. “There is no action required as a result of declaring China a currency manipulator. Effectively, what Romney is saying is, ‘I won’t change anything, but I’ll stick it in China’s eye.’”
Hamburger linked the idea of China as a problem or threat to the concept of American unease.
“U.S. trade relations with China, as well as a fear of China as a risen power, reflect this concern about where we’re going,” he said. “The foreign policy issues that Romney is now raising … are an attempt to fire up this concern about America’s place in the world and also instill doubts about Obama’s ability to lead.”

Pinstripes, a restaurant chain that also offers bowling and bocce, may be among the new tenants of the soon-to-be-renovated Shops at Georgetown Park.
The restaurant has submitted a proposal to the D.C. Board of Zoning Adjustment to build a new venue in the mall and hopes to open within a year.
Pinstripes locations’ fine-dining atmospheres, complete with a wine cellar and upscale decor, set them apart from the traditional bowling venue, according to founder and CEO Dale Schwartz.
“We’re very, very different. We’re just a … quality venue that is unlike any other out there,” Schwartz said.
Schwartz said that he seeks to replicate the ambience of high-end hotels such as the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton.
According to Schwartz, Georgetown is an ideal location for Pinstripes because of the nature of the neighborhood.
“We tend to look for high-quality markets with residential communities that have an appreciation for sophisticated fun,” Schwartz said.
Not everyone shares Schwartz’s enthusiasm for a bowling alley in Georgetown, however. As reported in local blog DCist, some residents, such as David Miller, are concerned with the consequences of developing a bowling alley in Georgetown.
“As recreation, it’s a great idea. But there are three main concerns: noise, noise and noise,” he told DCist. “I don’t believe there’s any concern at all about the who, what, where it is in that mall and the impact it may have on the residents above it.”
In particular, many residents who live in the condominiums in the upper levels of the Shops at Georgetown Park worry about the noise and the vibrations from a game of bowling.
“In every one of our locations, we get concerns,” Schwartz said. “It’s mostly people that really don’t initially fully understand how different we really are from any bowling or, for that matter, entertainment venue. In every location we’ve done, after we’ve simply talked to the local residents and anybody else about the issues, we’ve in every case been able to get people very comfortable with what we are doing.”
Currently, Washington only has one bowling alley open to the public: Lucky Strike in Chinatown. Unlike Pinstripes, Lucky Strike offers the more traditional bowling alley staples of pizza and tacos.
If the BZA approves the proposal, the Georgetown location will be Pinstripes’ fifth venue in the United States. Pinstripes currently has three restaurants in Illinois and one in Minnesota.
Schwartz also indicated interest in expanding to multiple locations in the metropolitan area.
“Over time we would consider doing one other, maybe two other, locations in the Virginia-Maryland-D.C. area,” Schwartz said.

According to Peter Beinart of The Daily Beast, neither President Obama nor Governor Romney won the recent foreign policy debate. The real winner was George W. Bush because “the framework for understanding the world that he put in place after Sept. 11 still holds.” He describes this framework as the viewing of foreign policy almost through an exclusively military lens.
I would actually argue the opposite. The reason why there was so little conflict in the debate is because both candidates envision a world where American power is driven more by economics and relationships than boots on the ground.
While much of the debate was focused on Afghanistan and Iraq, what stood out was the level of agreement between the two candidates on significant military withdrawals.
For instance, both Obama and Romney support keeping the United States out of Syria as well as removing an American military presence from the country by the end of 2014.
On the issue of China, both candidates appreciate that the country is quickly becoming a global superpower, if it is not already. Moreover, Obama and Romney both understand the increasing sensitivity on the issue of China in many parts of the United States.
For his part, Romney has pledged to label China a “currency manipulator” and to generally push a tougher line. Obama has responded by using the power of incumbency to press trade cases against China at the World Trade Organization.
Most of Romney’s criticisms of Obama’s foreign policy are relatively broad, centering on the theme that the president has apologized too much for the United States’ actions. These relatively minor grievances are just another indication of how the differences between the two candidates are sometimes more based on tone than actual policy.
Even though the GOP has been dominated for most of my own life by neoconservatives who support military interventions internally by and large, the Republican Party also has a substantial isolationist component embodied in some ways by Rand and Ron Paul.
The era when Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) were emblematic of the GOP foreign policy establishment are fast dissolving. In its place are an increasing number of Republicans who are asking whether Americans can afford as many commitments abroad, especially as the deficit becomes a greater and greater risk to long-term American vitality.
The reality is that it is difficult for Republicans to criticize the president’s record, as under the Obama administration the United States has had a slew of victories abroad, such as bringing Osama Bin Laden to justice. Obama has also finally ended the disastrous war in Iraq and set a timetable for American soldiers leaving Afghanistan.
At the same, the United States has worked to shift its focus towards Asia, which is fast becoming the center of global geopolitics. Obama has worked to expand upon historic relationships with countries such as South Korea and Japan while broadening American military presence in the region to countries such as Australia.
While foreign policy is traditionally an issue that benefits Republicans, it appears to be the opposite in this election. In the instant CBS polls after the recent debate, viewers selected Obama as the winner by as much as 30 points. Couple this with the fact that Secretary of State Hilary Clinton has a stratospheric 66 percent approval rating, her highest in almost 15 years.
These relative successes have resulted in the GOP and Romney adopting policies similar to those of the president.
In the end, regardless of who is elected president, the United States will end up with a roughly similar foreign policy. In contrast to what Beinart argues, this country will increasingly view the world through an economic, rather than military, perspective.

Former and current members of the State Department discussed the future of the United States’ role in Asia in Gaston Hall Thursday afternoon.
The event,“Forging Consensus: U.S.-Asia Policy in the Next Administration,” was organized by the Korea Economic Institute, the School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program and Georgetown’s Office of the President.
University President John J. DeGioia introduced the panel, which was comprised of Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell and three of his predecessors — Richard Solomon, Winston Lord and Christopher Hill. The panel was moderated by Georgetown Director of Asian Studies Victor Cha, a former member of the National Security Council.
The discussion focused on the members’ experiences in the State Department, particularly with respect to U.S.-China relations, but panelists also spoke more broadly about their perceptions of the balance of power in Asia.
According to Winston Lord, who was assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs between 1993 and 1997, each of the panelists had worked to bring China into the spotlight, but Campbell has been the most effective at elevating the country’s profile.
“The real challenge of my period as assistant secretary was trying to salvage this relationship,” he said. “I don’t think we could succeed, certainly not in the way Kurt Campbell has succeeded.”
“I … believe that the 21st century will be seen as the Asian-Pacific century,” said Abraham Kim, interim president of the Korea Economic Institute, and panel moderator.
The members all agreed on the importance of cooperation within the United States to maintain its influence abroad.
“Bipartisanship is not just important in election season. It’s important always,” Campbell said.
“If we get our act together politically and economically, that is the single best thing we can do for our China policy and our foreign policy in general,” Lord agreed.
The panelists also emphasized the importance of China’s own domestic policy.
“I think the issues in China are driven by domestic issues in China,” Christopher Hill, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs from 2005 to 2009, said. “It’s not all about us.”
The event concluded with SFS Dean Carroll Lancaster’s presentation of the “Georgetown Asia Award” to Campbell for his service to U.S.-Asia Relations
Ying Sun, a first year student in Georgetown’s new Master’s in Asian Studies Program, said he found the discussion interesting but is not sure how much of it will be applied in U.S. foreign policy.
“I think it’s going to be hard because there are issues within the United States,” she said.
“It’s so obvious that the United States has a lot of a role in Asia,” said Hyeon Young Ro, also a first year student in the Asian studies program.

I t’s Monday morning, and Zach Ashenfarb (COL ’15) is sitting in a too-small chair in a classroom at Beers Elementary School in Anacostia. Across from him sits Robert, a third grader struggling to complete a worksheet on adjectives.
“He couldn’t even read the instructions, so it was very stressful,” Ashenfarb, a volunteer for D.C. Reads, said. “I finally explained to him what the sheet was about, and when he figured it out, he said, ‘You’re smart,’ and I said, ‘No, you’re smart.’ … I really cherished that moment.”
Ashenfarb is one of nearly 500 Georgetown students who volunteers in classrooms and community centers across the city on a weekly basis through D.C. Reads and the D.C. Schools Project, the university’s two main volunteer programs promoting educational outreach in the District.
Though the nation’s capital is home to several successful universities, the District’s public education system is notorious for its shortcomings. The local government spends more money per student than any state in the nation, but the results aren’t there. According to the National Center for Educational Statistic, the city’s fourth graders underperform on math and reading tests by a margin of about 20 points below the national average.
Disparities exist across the District as well. Wards 1, 2, 3 and 4, which include Georgetown, The George Washington and American Universities, are the most affluent and home to the highest-performing public schools. Ward 2, for example, where Georgetown is located, has a poverty rate of 15 percent, just below the city-wide average of 18 percent. By contrast, Ward 7 and Ward 8 have rates of 26 and 35 percent, respectively.
According to a report released by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education, students at schools in the more affluent areas can drastically outpace peers at schools in Wards 5, 6, 7 and 8 on standardized texts after just one year. The study looked at students with similar numbers on standardized tests after a year in their respective schools and noticed a large disparity in growth.
These disparaties are reflected in the resources available to schools in Southeast D.C. According to The Washington Post, just 10 percent of the city’s teachers designated by the government as “highly effective” work in these areas, home to 41 schools. Meanwhile, 20 percent work in the 10 Ward 3 schools alone. Wards 7 and 8 are where programs like D.C. Reads and D.C. Schools Project step in to try and bridge the achievement gap.
“Students aren’t necessarily given the tools or resources that they need to perform at the level that the District is asking them to perform at,” said Cat Skolniki (COL ’13), a coordinator for D.C. Reads.
The program, which is run through the Center for Social Justice, sends about 250 Georgetown students to elementary schools and community centers in Ward 7 and reaches roughly 400 schoolchildren on a weekly basis.
Skolniki began working with D.C. Reads as a freshman and became a coordinator the following year.
“As I came to learn about all the issues and as I built relationships with students and parents and families, I became highly engaged in … education in D.C.,” she said.
Elisa Manrique (COL ’14), another D.C. Reads coordinator, added that the program is about more than improving reading levels.
“There are other things we can do to complement [reading efforts] — creating relationships that are durable with the kids and helping in their personal lives,” she said.
The D.C. Schools Project, another student-run tutoring organization, focuses specifically on serving the city’s immigrant community. Tutoring both on and off campus, DCSP’s 300 members work with about 100 adults and 150 school children to help them improve their grasp of the English language.
Hui Min Cao (COL ’13), a DCSP coordinator who works with adult groups, explained that the program was started in 1984 to aid children from Sudan but now features one-on-one tutoring in people’s homes and the more community-based approach of helping adults. Cao, a first-generation American whose parents emigrated from China, was inspired to get involved by her own experiences.
“I missed my parents and understood the mission of the program,” she said. “The tutees are almost exactly like my parents.”
Though the two programs are hugely popular on campus — about one in 20 students participates in one of the groups — the work they do is no easy task. Much of the success of campus tutoring organizations depends on the dedication of tutors and their ability to work successfully with students who can sometimes be uncooperative.
“Dealing with the children can be a little rough,” D.C. Reads tutor Marcus Byrd (NHS ’15) said. “They’re not really paying attention, they’re playing around or they’re asking to go to the bathroom. They’re always so distracted.”
Byrd also explained that some of the students served by D.C. Reads deal with learning and attention disabilities.
“I know a lot of the tutors will get frustrated because their tutee has a slight learning disability, so it can be hard to get over that hurdle and reiterate things.”
Many of the students also come from families that face economic hardships, and as a result, tutors must manage the stereotype of the affluent Georgetown student.
“What we have to do is go in there without any notion of privilege,” Manrique said. “As Georgetown students, we carry a certain label with us within the D.C. community. … Walking into these schools and presenting ourselves in a way that we don’t seem condescending is a challenge.”
But perhaps the most daunting challenge of working with the District’s struggling public schools is the absence of tangible progress.
“The system isn’t very good, and that’s why we tutor,” Byrd said. “But I personally haven’t seen a huge change.”
Byrd added that it can be hard to see progress, given that he has only worked with only one student per semester. He added that the system itself doesn’t always seem conducive to students’ learning.
“Standardized test scores are sometimes posted for all the class to see, [which can cause] morale issues when students know they aren’t performing up to standards.”
Ashenfarb deals with many of the same concerns and sometimes questions his work.
“Am I even doing anything? Am I making a difference at all? Am I going to finish this problem, and they’re going to forget it completely by the next time I come?” he said. “In [these] situations … I feel powerless.”
But Manrique believes that while the programs may not be creating widespread, systemic change, there is value in impacting individual students.
“It’s hard to say we are improving literacy for the whole community. We would need triple the number of people,” she said. “We take it school by school and child by child, and it comes down to looking at each child as an individual. Within the arbitrary standards given by standardized testing, we are definitely creating the change we want to see.”
While D.C. Reads tutors labor in individual classrooms, the D.C. public education system at large is in the midst of substantial change.
Before 2007, the education system was governed by the D.C. Board of Education, which would often become entangled in ward politics. When the District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 was passed, it made the mayor the ultimate executive over the system, in an attempt to bypass the long delays that the council had inflicted on reforms.
When Adrian Fenty took office that year, he appointed Michelle Rhee to the newly created position of chancellor of public schools in the District. In her first year in office, Rhee, who had previously run a non-profit that trained teachers for urban schools, shut down 23 schools, cut over 120 administrative positions and fired 36 principals. During her term, she also renegotiated teacher contracts to eliminate tenure and allow for removal of teachers based on student performance on standardized exams.
The administration was criticized by parents, members of teachers’ unions and councilmembers for lack of transparency and fairness, and Rhee resigned her position in 2010 after Mayor Fenty lost his primary bid for re-election. She was replaced by Kaya Henderson under current Mayor Vincent Gray.
Skolnicki expressed frustration with both administrations.
“There is a common misconception that once Michelle Rhee left, a lot changed or improved,” she said. “What a lot of people don’t know is that Kaya Henderson worked directly under Michelle Rhee during her term, and [Henderson] actually proposed a lot of the reforms that went into place when Rhee was in office. There really hasn’t been that much of a change since Rhee left. It’s still in a really bad state.”
This year, a new round of budget cuts has put a serious dent in the funding provided for afterschool programs like D.C. Reads and DCSP.
The city recently cut the contact person these groups used to coordinate their efforts, instead giving each employee three schools to watch over.
“We don’t have as easy communication with our programming,” Skolnicki said. “It forces us to reach out to other administrators and community members to make sure we can still operate.”
The lack of stability proved problematic for both tutors and their students.
“We saw a lot of pushback because the coordinator was eliminated and [we] had to forge new partnerships,” Manrique said. “We had trouble with new school coordinators’ thinking they could shift kids around. It was a battle for kids.”
Despite the students’ continued struggles, Skolnicki considers D.C. Reads to have had a positive impact.
“I’ve seen the program grow and have been with a lot of the students because I have been able to follow students and their siblings throughout these four years,” she said. “I’ve seen how they react to D.C. Reads, and it’s — for the most part — entirely positive.”
While Skolnicki is optimistic about D.C. Reads’ long-term prospects, for Manrique, it’s the small victories and day-to-day progress that make her work worthwhile.
“If a kid you were working with reads a word he couldn’t read two weeks ago, it’s a big deal,” Manrique said. “If a kid jumps three reading levels, it’s a big deal. If we pull off a successful advocacy event, it’s a big deal. There are amazing things happening every day, and they are all different and all rewarding.”

U2 frontman and social activist Bono spoke about the fight against global poverty and AIDS in Gaston Hall Monday evening.
The event was co-sponsored by Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan and the Global Social Enterprise Initiative at the McDonough School of Business.
Bono criticized the prevalence of attack ads in the presidential campaign, joking about a scenario in which universities ran attack ads.
“Hello, we’re Georgetown and we approve this message. … Syracuse: a school whose mascot is a fruit,” he said in a mocking, baritone voice.
More seriously, he called for Americans to focus their energy on global health issues rather than partisan politics.
“I’d like to hear an attack ad on malaria,” he said.
Bono went on to speak about the effects budget cuts have on populations that depend on foreign aid for famine and AIDS relief.
“Cuts shouldn’t cost lives,” he said. “We must not let the economic recession become a moral recession.”
He discussed the efforts that are necessary to make a difference, challenging the idea that social change can be affected through a one-dollar donation at the grocery store.
“If you want to turn the world right-side up, it’s not going to take a minute or an hour or a day. It’s going to take your whole life,” he said.
Bono emphasized the importance of fostering independent economic growth and investment in developing countries and the pitfalls of reliance on foreign aid, comparing growth in China to growth in Africa.
“We used to talk about Asian tigers … but this is not an African tiger. This is a lion,” he said, predicting that Africa’s future economic development would mirror China’s recent rise to prominence.
Bono closed his speech with an appeal to the American ideals of equality and the pursuit of happiness, saying that support for global health and development initiatives is an extension of these values.
“These aren’t just American ideals anymore. … These truths, your truths, they’re self-evident in us,” he said.
Students said they appreciated Bono’s advocacy efforts in addition to his stage presence.
“It was very inspiring. Obviously he’s very passionate about what he does and really believes that all of us can make a change,” Nadeen Hussain (NHS ’15) said. “He encouraged us to think outside the box and make change.”
“He was very personable. He was both a rock star and innovative,” Lee Stromberg (MSB ’13) said. “He had the charisma of a rock star but the ability to connect with people very easily.

While most students were baking pumpkin pies and watching football in the comfort of their own homes Wednesday, those who remained on campus were invited to take part in a Georgetown tradition: University President John J. DeGioia’s annual Thanksgiving dinner in O’Donovan Hall.
DeGioia and his wife began the tradition his first year as president to provide students who were unable to go home with a proper Thanksgiving.
“[The first year,] we didn’t know if anyone would come, but a few hundred people came,” DeGioia said in this year’s opening remarks.
Georgetown Catering and Leo’s staff decorated the second floor of the dining hall with mood lighting, linen tablecloths, fall-themed centerpieces and a three-piece band to create a festive atmosphere.
To add another personal touch, DeGioia stood at the front of the room and personally greeted each student who walked in. The event drew students from the Georgetown University Medical Center and Law Center in addition to those from the main campus. Many of those who attended were international students.
“It’s a great way to introduce our international students to a truly American Thanksgiving,” DeGioiasaid.
While many students attended with friends who also remained on campus, Min Xiong (GRD ’15), went alone. Xiong, an international student from China, found herself at a table of complete strangers but spoke comfortably with a research assistant and with a professor and his family.
“We [international students] appreciate Georgetown sharing the spirit of the holiday with us. It’s a great way to have a taste of an American Thanksgiving,” Xiong said. “And what a great atmosphere — there’s live music.”
Other international students were equally grateful for the invitation.
“I was really thankful that President DeGioia gave us this opportunity.” Yui Ota (LAW ’13) said. “It shows so much hospitality. Events like these help create a sense of community and help teach us American traditions.”

The House of Representatives passed a bill Nov. 30 that would grant green cards to graduates of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, also known as STEM, masters and doctorate programs.
The STEM Jobs Act reallocates 55,000 visas from the Diversity Visa program that served people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.
While the measure did not make it past the House when it was originally proposed in September, the most recent attempt garnered support from both Democrats and Republicans.
The legislation, however, is not expected to be debated in the Senate until the new Congress forms early next year because of the debate surrounding the fiscal cliff.
Among math and sciences at Georgetown, a significant number of graduate students are foreign.
In the mathematics and statistics department, about 20 out of 80 students are international while approximately half of the chemistry department’s 70 doctoral candidates are from other countries.
Professors in STEM fields have mixed opinions about the legislation.
YuYe Tong, head of the chemistry department, said that the bill failed to address the difficulties of the visa application process itself. According to Tong, graduates can apply for an EB-2 visa that guarantees permanent residency to those who have employment offers, but he said that the process is time consuming. In addition, the company-sponsored H-1B visa has a quota and is rendered void once the worker quits or is fired.
Ken Shaw, director of graduate studies for mathematics and statistics, agreed that the sponsorship portion of the visa is a problem for STEM students.
“Nearly all [of] the international students want to stay in the U.S. and find permanent employment. And nearly all seem to have some trouble finding a position that will sponsor them for residency,” he wrote in an email. “Persistence pays off but many have to return to their home countries.”
Although Shaw wrote that the bill would help many math and statistics graduates get jobs in fields that typically require citizenship, Tong said that providing visas would leave a surplus of scientists.
“You don’t want to keep those people who can’t find jobs so what I would say is that you should automatically give people green cards if they can find a job,” Tong said.
Other professors, however, say that not all graduates want to stay in the U.S.
“The times have changed now: a lot of students come now and return to their home countries,” saidMakarand Paranjape, co-director of graduate studies in the physics department. “A lot of the students from China have a desire to learn here and return to China. It’s not necessarily true now that they flock to the U.S. because it’s the land of opportunity, because they have chances in their home countries.”
He stressed that the government must weigh the costs and benefits of the visa allocation system.
“You’ve got to be wary about how the green cards would be allotted, if they’re going to be add- on, additional or if they’re going to be taken away from other places,” he said.

European immigration experts Olga Gulina, Sarah Perret and Olivier Vonk led a panel discussion on immigration policy and reform in Europe and the United States Wednesday afternoon.
The talk, co-sponsored by the BMW Center for German and European Studies and the Institute for the Study of International Migration, covered policies in France, Russia, Germany and the United States.
“I think having a comparative perspective on immigration is always valuable, particularly for those of us in the United States who will be moving into a very intensive round of new debate on immigration reform,” ISIM Director Susan Martin said.
Vonk, an ISIM visiting fellow, began the discussion by introducing the European Union Democracy Observatory Data Centre, a database that compares immigration standards and procedures in countries around Europe.
“We provide country profiles on 47 countries in Europe, in which we also include country reports where we discuss the historical and political backgrounds of nationality laws in Europe from the 20thcentury up to the present,” Vonk said.
EUDO is a work in progress and hopes to expand to the United States, Caribbean countries and other countries around the world, possibly enlisting Georgetown’s help to do so, Vonk added.
Perret, a BMW Center visiting fellow, then spoke on immigration reform in France, Germany and the United States, focusing on naturalization and securitization.
“For me, naturalization is the transition from ‘them’ to ‘us’ and the final step of an immigrant’s journey,” Perret said. “This process goes both ways as it [involves] the will of an individual to belong to a community but also the community accepting this individual.”
Perret said that the United States began to fear immigrants after 9/11, viewing them as a possible threat. Perret added that President Obama’s recent immigration efforts would decrease thesecuritization of the American immigration process.
Gulina, a visiting fellow at the Kennan Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, contrasted the immigration policies of Germany, Russia and the United States. Gulinadeemed the United States’ immigration policy the clearest of the three countries’.
Attendees appreciated the scholars’ views on international immigration and recognized immigration as a multi-faceted topic.
“I thought the talk was very interesting, and these are extraordinarily complex issues,” Mike Gelner, who worked in the Foreign Service in China for many years, said. “Different countries have different things that they ask of their citizens … there’s really a lot to immigration. After all, millions of people are moving around the world.”

Georgetown’s regular decision undergraduate applicant pool for the Class of 2017 was almost identical to that of the previous year, which bucks a trend of application growth in previous years.
A total of 20,025 students applied in the early and regular decision cycles, down just 0.1 percent from last year’s 20,050. Of those, 13,289 were regular decision applications, down slightly from last year’s 13,351. The Class of 2016 continued a trend of year-to-year application increases, with a jump from the previous year’s 19,228 applications.
Although the College received the largest number of applications out of the university’s four schools, with 11,714, this figure marked a 2.5 percent decrease from last year. The School of Foreign Service had the second largest pool, with 3,690 applicants, marking an increase of 1 percent.
A record number of students applied to the McDonough School of Business and the School of Nursing & Health Studies, with the MSB experiencing an 8 percent increase, with 3,370 students applying, and the NHS receiving 1,251 applicants, a 4.2 percent increase.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said these figures, which reflect national trends, have stemmed from ongoing concerns about the economy.
“Students are more concerned with job security,” he said. “They are gravitating to science and pre-med tracks.”
While the total number of applicants remained consistent with last year when a little over 20,100 people applied, this year, the diversity of the student body continues to expand, Deacon said. African Americans made up 7.6 percent of the applicants, Asian Americans 15 percent and Hispanic Americans 11.8 percent.
International students also made up 12.8 percent of this year’s applicant pool. Between 2,200 and 2,400 applicants applied from China and India.
“We are not doing anything new to attract students from those areas,” Deacon said. “There is just a sort of natural momentum.”
As has been the trend in the past few years, the most applicants have come from California, with 2,500 applicants, and New York, which had 1,800 students apply.
Although the early acceptance rate for the Class of 2017 was a record low at 13 percent, Deacon said he expects the overall acceptance rate to remain consistent at about 16 percent.
Citing a report by the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education, which indicates that the number of high school graduates peaked in 2010 and will decline until 2020, Deacon said he was pleased with Georgetown’s continued success in attracting students to the university.
“Since the total pool of possible applicants is declining, Georgetown has had to, in effect, increase its market share just to stay even,” he said.
Maintaining the same levels of applicants has proved to be a challenge for some schools this year. Boston College’s decision to add a 400-word essay to its Common Application supplement this year caused the number of applications to drop from 35,000 in 2012 to 25,000 this year, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Other peer institutions that use Common App had mixed results. According to a report in The New York Times, Dartmouth College had 23,052 applicants in 2012 but 22,400 in 2013. At Vanderbilt University, 30,870 students applied this year, which marked an 8.9 percent increase over last year when 28,348 submitted applications.
Georgetown is among a small group of universities, along with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that do not use the Common App. That Georgetown maintains such a high number of applicants without using the application system is a point of pride for Deacon.
“If 10,000 students didn’t apply because of one essay, how good can your numbers be?” Deacon said. “Georgetown’s are real.”

Martin Iguchi, dean of the School of Nursing and Health Studies, will travel to Japan as a member of the U.S.-Japan Council’s 2013 Japanese American Leadership Delegation from March 8 to 13.
Since 2000, the JALD program has sent delegations of 10 Japanese Americans, all of whom are leaders in their respective fields, to meet with Japanese leaders to exchange ideas and strengthen the relationship between the two countries, both important trading partners to one another.
“I see this as an opportunity to highlight the work that we are doing globally as well as looking to develop additional opportunities,” Iguchi said. “The mission really is to build stronger ties with one of the primary trading partners with the U.S.”
Iguchi was selected for this year’s delegation in December 2012 because of his track record of leadership and knowledge in medical research. His research has special relevance because of the challenges Japan is facing after the 2011 earthquake and ensuing nuclear crisis.
“He was a great bridge between education and health,” U.S.-Japan Council Senior Communications Manager Laura Hayes said. “He has really expressed interest in forming partnerships down the line with Japanese counterparts in the area of health.”
For the first time this year, the delegation will travel to Fukushima Prefecture, the region most affected by both the 2011 nuclear crisis and earthquake. Arriving on the second anniversary of the incident, the delegation will participate in a symposium about recovery efforts, disaster management and revitalization of the region.
In addition to U.S.-Japanese relations and energy policies following the 2011 nuclear disaster, the delegation will address rising tensions with China and South Korea over disputed islands, immigration policy, economic policy and the growth of nonprofit business in Japan.
“I think it’s a really positive step for any entity, governmental or business, to speak with individuals from other cultures to better understand how their world views might be different,”
Iguchi said.
Iguchi said that the delegation was helpful to Toyota during its mass recalls in 2009 and 2010.
“The politicians and business leaders find that the feedback from a diverse group of Japanese Americans is useful in understanding how Americans are thinking about their country,” Iguchi said. “A few years ago during the crisis at Toyota, with their sudden acceleration, there was a lot of very frank discussion. They were able to help Toyota better understand how the American consumers were perceiving their response to the issue.”
Apart from his role as dean of the NHS, Iguchi is an adjunct behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, where he formerly served as the director of the Drug Policy Research Center. He has conducted extensive research about drug addiction, drug policy, the criminal justice system, health disparities and HIV transmission.
The delegation will also meet with Japan’s political and business leaders in Tokyo, including ShinzoAbe, the new Prime Minister, and members of the Japanese National Diet, the country’s parliament.
“The whole point of this program is to go to Japan and while they are meeting with high-ranking individuals from all sectors of society … [and] to build people-to-people connections,” Hayes said. “It’s a two-way street; we want them to bring lessons home from Japan and share knowledge for the U.S.”
The JALD program allows members of the delegation to gain a better understanding of how each country is viewed by the other, according to Iguchi.
Hayes said that the U.S.-Japan Council hopes the delegates will maintain their relationships after returning from the trip.
“I think we both believe Japanese Americans play this unique catalytic role in maintaining a strong and vibrant U.S.-Japan relationship,” Hayes said.
Iguchi added that he hopes the trip will not only strengthen ties between Japan and the United States, but also allow him to promote Georgetown and the NHS abroad.

Economics professor Garance Genicot is exploring the possibility of a starting a Georgetown branch of the Food Recovery Network, a program that supplies the large quantities of food waste produced by campus dining halls to local shelters.
Since its founding at the University of Maryland, the program has expanded to universities across the country, including Brown University, University of Texas at Austin, University of California at Berkley and Pomona College.
According to Leo’s Marketing Manager Kendra Boyer, Leo’s uses a computerized menu management system to accurately calculate the amount of food required for a full menu each mealtime. Leo’s cooks smaller amounts of food throughout an extended time period rather than cooking a large batch at the beginning of the meal to prevent waste. Unused portions are also sometimes worked into other recipes.
“This allows us to provide a continuous supply of fresh cooked food and minimize the amount of overproduction,” Boyer wrote in an email.
Using these methods, Leo’s produces two pounds of usable food waste along with an average of 240 pounds of unusable food waste per day.
GUSA Senate Subcommittee on Food Service Co-Chair Sam Greco (SFS ’15) added that a recent poster campaign encouraged students to take only what they can eat.
In addition, although Georgetown has worked with nearby shelters and food banks to donate food waste in the past and sponsored a canned food drive in November, Greco noted that specific types of food are commonly wasted.
“There is an opportunity to donate … bread, but Leo’s hasn’t identified a food bank that will take it,” Greco said.
But for Genicot, any food waste is a matter of personal concern.
“My grandmother was in Belgium during the war, and the idea of throwing food away is something I absolutely hate. As much as I can, I try to give away extra food and not throw it away,” Genicot said. “If you are exposed to anyone who lived during those times, then throwing food in the trash seems like such a waste.”
To solve this problem, Genicot proposed a partnership with Martha’s Table, a local nonprofit that provides food and nutritional programs for D.C. residents in need, but said that Georgetown’s relatively small size could be an obstacle in establishing this program.
“Georgetown is much smaller [than the University of Maryland], and I don’t know what the level of waste is here and at what level it makes sense to organize food recuperation,” Genicot said. “This is something that is worth exploring.”
Martha’s Table depends on donations from academic groups, charities and other informal organizations for volunteers and donations. Martha’s Table Food Programs Assistant DirectorDemetrios Recachinas, however, said that the organization is selective about food donations.
“We are being more selective about things that people donate,” Recachinas said. “Going through some of the product tends to be more laborious. While some product does really well, some product takes much more effort and is not worth the cost. But we are all about developing partnerships.”
Recachinas did not specify what steps would have to be taken for Leo’s to partner with Martha’s Table.
Boyer stressed that Georgetown Dining is also open to new partnerships, and Greco added that the Georgetown student body’s commitment to social justice suggests it would be an effective partner of Food Recovery Network.
“Georgetown students are incredibly committed to helping others, the environment and social justice,” Greco said. “We are in a better situation than Maryland, but if a group of students wanted to work with Leo’s to initiate a similar program I’m sure students would rally around that and take that initiative.”

Edmund Burke III, a research professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz, analyzed the significance of the Mediterranean’s geographic location in the development of the region during the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies’ 2013 Annual Symposium Wednesday.
This year’s conference focus is “The Mediterranean Re-Imagined” in honor of late Georgetown professor Faruk Tabak, author of “The Waning of the Mediterranean, 1550-1870: A Geohistorical Approach.”
Burke’s keynote address, “Models of Mediterranean Modernity: The Perspective from the Longue Durée,” emphasized the Mediterranean’s centrality to a broader world history.
“In this talk, I seek to reexamine against the background of world history how the Mediterranean came to modernity,” Burke, who is also director of UC Santa Cruz’s Center for World History, said. “Middle Eastern problems are not just Middle Eastern problems.”
Ecologic and economic factors were key in shaping the history of the many regions that surround the Mediterranean, Burke added. In particular, the Little Ice Age, a period of significant cooling in temperatures that affected Europe from the mid-14th to 19th century, precipitated to a great decline in the continent’s relative prosperity.
“The Little Ice Age cumulatively devastates Mediterranean agriculture,” Burke said.
The Mediterranean’s population, which was equal to China’s population in 1000 CE, was only one-fourth of the Chinese population by 1800, he added.
Despite the negative impact of the Little Ice Age, Burke said, Europe achieved preeminence as the world’s most powerful region in great part because of the economic benefits it reaped from its exploration and later colonization of the New World.
“Europe’s overseas colonies provided a strategic advantage in the new local struggle for empire,
Burke said. “As a result it achieved results well above the new global norms.”
However, before global colonization, the Mediterranean Sea helped civilizations in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa prosper. The role of the sea in precipitating cross-cultural maritime trade guaranteed Mediterranean-based peoples certain economic advantages over those who did not have access to warm water ports.
“For millennia, the prosperity of the region was ensured,” Burke said.
However, the rise of trade routes through Indian and then Atlantic Oceans reduced the sea’s importance to Northern Europe.
While Mediterranean countries today take advantages of oil reserves, the region was at a developmental disadvantage during the Industrial Revolution due to its lack of coal and iron. This, in particular, stymied the process of industrialization in much of the Arab world.
“It’s a time when we can begin to start to rethink the modern Arab world in bigger ways and indeed in global ways,” Burke said.
Burke is currently working on a book, “The History of the Modern Mediterranean, 1450-1950,” that will examine themes from his keynote address.
Nabil Matar, professor of English at the University of Minnesota, said he thought Burke underemphasized some aspects of Europe’s dominance of Mediterranean cultures.
“This is, in my view, not sufficient. In my view there is also the military side,” Matar said, citing British and French attacks on Mediterranean infrastructure.
Matar presented his own work on the Mediterranean as an obstacle to Arab cartography at the symposium Thursday afternoon.

World Bank President Jim Yong Kim presented a bold vision for the end of global poverty in Gaston Hall Tuesday afternoon.
“We now have the opportunity to rid the world of the stain of global poverty and economic exclusion,” Kim said. “But if we are to succeed, we must make some hard decisions.”
He outlined the World Bank’s major goals for the near future, the foremost of which is to end extreme poverty by 2030. Kim argued that the goal can be attained provided growth rates in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa remain high and growth translates into job transference and overall decline of poverty. But Kim acknowledged that the timeline is extremely ambitious, and that success is by no means a guarantee.
“We must move with greater urgency,” Kim said. “We must focus on how the United Nations can work together as a multilateral system more effectively. The challenges in front of us are enormous, but progress is inevitable.”
Kim said that the policy decisions must take into consideration the state of global development, specifically regarding the current economic crisis, which he said still affects world markets despite some leaders’ assurances of economic recovery.
Kim transitioned fluidly between statistics and anecdotes to remind the audience that behind the numbers, world poverty has very real impacts on individuals’ lives.
“Let me stress the human face of this crisis,” Kim said. “We need to restart growth in order to help millions of families. Today, we learned that the overall unemployment rate in the eurozone is 12 percent. This means that people don’t have jobs and are suffering today, and many have lost hope.”
Recalling a trip to China earlier this year, Kim shared the inspiring story of a woman who dreamed of building her own business but lacked the financial means to get started. She scraped by on her husband’s income as a taxi driver until she secured a $10,000 loan from a local bank as part of a program promoting female entrepreneurship. The International Finance Corporation, a private sector branch of the World Bank, sponsored this loan, allowing her to successfully open her own car repair shop, which now employs approximately 150 individuals.
Kim cited such stories as the reason for his positive outlook. With advances in the social sectorcombatting HIV/AIDS, especially in children, Kim said there is great promise for the improvement of global conditions.  For example, in 1990, 43 percent of the international population lived on less than $1.25 per day. That statistic had fallen to 21 percent by 2010.
“We are at an auspicious moment in history when the successes of past decades and an increasingly favorable economic outlook combine to give developing countries a chance for the first time ever to end extreme poverty,” Kim said.
Kim stressed the importance of inclusive growth that includes people from across the globe, deeming action toward the betterment of human conditions a moral imperative. Kim cited the 1.3 billion people still living in extreme poverty and the 6.9 million children under the age of five that die every year.
“Fighting extreme poverty, however, is not enough,” Kim said. “We must collectively work to enable these individuals to lift themselves well above the line of poverty and boost shared prosperity.”
Kim concluded by stressing the importance of addressing these issues for the sake of the younger generation.
“A world without extreme poverty is the world we want for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren,” Kim said. “The opportunity is squarely in front of us, now we must seize the arc of history and bend it towards justice.”

There was fortunately no April Fools’ prank awaiting 2,413 students who received regular decision letters of acceptance to the Georgetown Class of 2017, a record portion of whom identify as racial minorities.
Of the 19,879 students that applied, 16.6 percent were admitted in the combined early and regular decision cycles, a slight bump from last year’s record low of 16.5 percent.
The McDonough School of Business, with an acceptance rate of 15.7 percent, was the most selective school for the first time ever, a distinction traditionally reserved for Georgetown College. The acceptance rate for the College, at 16.3 percent, was the only one to increase from last year across the four schools. Admission to the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the Walsh School of Foreign Service, both at 17.7 percent, also grew more competitive this year.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) attributed the distribution to the current state of the economy and increasing pressure for students to choose “practical” majors.
“Students seem very concerned with secure career choices, which is why we’re seeing this increase inMSB [and] NHS majors,” Deacon said.
There was a three-point bump from last year in the number of accepted students who identify as Hispanic, now at 11 percent. Thirteen percent of admitted students identified as Asian and eight percent as black, both down two percent from last year’s accepted class. Seven percent of accepted students identified with multiple races. These combined figures have resulted in Georgetown’s most diverse admitted class ever, with 39 percent coming from minority backgrounds.
In addition, a record number of first-generation college students — 12 percent — were admitted, which Deacon attributed to the Georgetown Scholarship Program.
“We continue to ask ourselves, ‘How can we go about doing a better job reaching out, levelling the playing field and attracting students from all backgrounds?’” Deacon said. “Raising money [for financial aid] is a critical question for the changing character of Georgetown.”
The accepted class is 55 percent female, slightly lower than the national trend of about 58 percent female, according to The New York Times.
International students made up 11 percent of admitted students, up from last year’s eight percent. The largest groups of foreign students were accepted from China, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Georgetown admitted students from all 50 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and 69 other countries, although the applicant pool indicated interest from students in 119 countries, according to Margaret Lysy, associate director of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
The two most represented states in the admitted class were California and New York, with 396 and 392 students, respectively. New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia saw 280, 180 and 159 students accepted, respectively.
Deacon emphasized that a major component of achieving a more diverse Georgetown will be a healthy endowment that allows the university to offer more generous financial aid packages to those who are accepted.
The Georgetown admissions process continues to distinguish itself from other universities with its mandatory interview and refusal to use the Common Application.
This decision results in fewer applicants and higher acceptance rates compared to peer institutions such as Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania, which had their lowest admissions rates on record with 5.79 and 12.1 percent, respectively, according to The New York Times. Yet Deacon believes the process allows Georgetown to take a more holistic approach to admissions, which includes mailing applicants their decisions rather than posting them online.
“We’ve held on to this way of doing it that we find to be a more appropriate way to end what has been a very lengthy and very important process in your life,” Deacon said.
Students on the waitlist must hold out until after May 1, when deposits are due, to find out whether they will join next year’s freshman class.
According to Deacon, the university has placed 2,000 students on the waitlist, from which it has traditionally taken around 50 to 100 people to reach its target number of 1,580 students — a number that has remained consistent for several years due to restrictions in the campus plan.

The completion of a Georgetown proposal with 26 other Jesuit colleges to establish a Jesuit liberal arts college in Hong Kong is now in limbo after a change in government in the Chinese special administrative sector.
After three years of planning, the Society of Jesus is nearing the final stages of submitting a proposal to establish the college on Queen’s Hill, a former British military base offered to a group for educational purposes free of charge by the Hong Kong government. But the land may no longer be available due to a new political dynamic in Hong Kong after legislative elections in September.
The government first announced the availability of 40 acres of land, worth $1 billion, in March 2010. In May 2011, the government accepted 11 letters of intent from groups planning to submit proposals for an educational institution on this land, with the Jesuit college as one of the contenders.
The Jesuits have been prepared to submit a proposal for over a year, but the Hong Kong government has not yet issued a call for proposals. According to Fr. Ron Anton, S.J., chairman of the board of trustees of the Jesuit Liberal Arts College, the Hong Kong government has told the Jesuits privately on several occasions of dates when they would issue a request for proposals, but these informal commitments have never been honored. In January of this year, the government announced publicly that it would issue a request for proposals at the end of March, but has yet to make an announcement.
“The new government is not as keen on this,” Anton said. “We do not know for sure what the future will be.”
The Hong Kong government’s announcement of the available land coincided with efforts by alumni of Hong Kong Jesuit high schools, called Wah Yan College. These alumni had approached President ofWah Yan College Fr. Stephen Chow, S.J., about expanding the Hong Kong Jesuit influence to higher education in 2008. Chow then reached out to then-provincial of China Fr. Louis Gendron, S.J., who authorized an exploratory committee to determine the feasibility of the project in June 2009. Gentonwrote to Fr. General Adolfo Nicolás of the Jesuits, who granted permission in February 2011. The current provincial of China, Fr. John Lee Hua, S.J., is still pursuing the project.
“We wanted to have a global university there. We wanted it not just to be the center for Hong Kong but to be a center for Jesuit education worldwide,” said Anton, who is also a senior coordinator of Jesuit university networking at Georgetown and served as the interim secretary of higher education for the Jesuits.
The proposal has four founding partners — Georgetown, Fordham University, the College of the Holy Cross and Santa Clara University — as well as 23 other partner colleges in countries on six continents. Former President of Holy Cross Fr. Michael McFarland, S.J., would serve as interim president of the liberal arts college during its first year.
In developing their proposal, the Society of Jesus hired The Boston Consulting Group to perform a marketing study of demand for liberal arts education in Asia and hired five companies, including design firm Sasaki Associates and developer Forrest City Enterprises, which has also been contracted to engineer Georgetown’s long-term expansion in the District, to do site planning. The group leading development of the liberal arts college also designed international majors for each department, which will combine a liberal arts discipline with an applied component in groupings such as economics and finance, art and design and political science and international relations.
While Anton doubted that the government would renege on its commitment to education entirely, he said that it could make the land unattractive so that no group would want to, or be able to, establish a college or university there.
For example, Anton said the government could require the winning group to build roads to the site or clean up environmental damage left over from the British military. The government could also continue with its educational plan but require the winning institution to conform to unsavory enrollment standards.
Anton said that the Jesuits would be willing to build roads to the site but would not be able to afford cleaning up environmental damage and would not want to pursue a project that would require them to alter their educational model.
“We want to start small and grow gradually. Even something like Georgetown started small and grew gradually,” Anton said. “We’re thinking maybe after 10 years, we would have 1,500 students. If the government says, ‘In 10 years we need 8,000 students,’ then that’s not going to be our model.”
However, Anton stressed that the failure to secure this specific parcel of land would not derail the project completely.
“We would go back to looking for other possibilities,” Anton said. “We won’t give up on having a university in Hong Kong.”
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the site, leaders of the proposed college have pushed forward on other fronts. They applied for accreditation by the Hong Kong Council for Accreditation of Academic and Vocational Qualifications in March 2012. In June, College Dean Chester Gillis, university librarian Artemis Kirk and Fr. Pat Rogers, S.J., travelled to Hong Kong as part of a 50-person team for a “site visit” required for accreditation. The college was granted accreditation conditional upon its fulfillment of its current goals in October 2012, marking the first time a college that does not exist yet has been approved.
The conditional accreditation required that the Jesuit liberal arts college establish a board of trustees, which now includes Anton as chair and University President John J. DeGioia. In total, the board of trustees is composed of 15 Jesuits from around the world and 15 laypersons mostly from Hong Kong. They met for the first time in January.
“It was really impressive to see so many people from different parts of the world so deeply connected to the success of this project,” DeGioia said.
Hong Kong currently has eight public research universities, but no liberal arts colleges. The Jesuits operate the all-male high schools at Wah Yan College that had been behind this project but do not have a presence in higher education in the region.
If the college were established, its student body would likely be diverse. Anton said he would expect two-thirds of students to be from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, while the remaining third would come from Southeast Asia. The students would also interact with the college’s 27 partner universities through articulation agreements that would allow students to split courses for their degree between Hong Kong and another university or to earn a bachelor’s degree in Hong Kong and a master’s degree at another school.
Anton said this opportunity is unique to the Jesuit educational network.
“This is a model for what a 21st century global university can be. Only the Jesuits can do this,” Anton said. “People talk about a three-campus or five-country program. Nobody else could have a 27-university partnership from every continent.”
The liberal arts college would account for differences between the Jesuit, Western educational system and the Chinese educational model, which depends on rote memorization and focuses more on science and math.
“We’re really trying to figure out how we can inform our understanding of liberal arts, our understanding of the humanities by a deeper engagement with those from a Confucian tradition,” DeGioia said.
The school would rely on small classes, which would be taught in English, to provide individual focus to each student.
“There would be some remedial work in getting students used to a more western way of education, a more independent, critical education,” Anton said. “We have to be very much aware they’re coming from different backgrounds.”
Anton also said this Jesuit education could serve as a transition for Asian students looking to do graduate work in the west.
Students would pay tuition rates of around $25,000 — significantly higher than those of public universities in Hong Kong but lower than tuition for students who go to university outside of Hong Kong.
The project has so far raised $1 million in cash and $1 million estimated in contributed services. Most donors have requested to remain anonymous at this stage of the development process, and the project has also secured donors conditional upon the guaranteed establishment of the school.
Anton could not specify how much the school will cost.
“We’re at a little bit of a sensitive point right now,” Anton said. “We’re waiting for the government after three years to see if they come out with a proposal and if it’s one we can live with. This is a very critical time.”
Both Anton and DeGioia, however, were optimistic about the college’s future.
“It’s a work in progress, and we’re very happy to be part of it,” DeGioia said. “I look forward to seeing what we’ll learn as a result.”

While students in the School of Foreign Service have the shared experience of preparing for language proficiency exams, the nature of the exams varies vastly from one language to another.
The SFS worked with language departments last year to standardize the goals and standards of proficiency exams to ensure students have grasped grammar, vocabulary and cultural understanding, according to SFS Associate Dean Emily Zenick, who oversees proficiency exams across departments.
“[Language tests] gauge two things. We care that the grammar’s right, that the vocabulary’s right and that students can understand the questions being asked of them and respond. So the linguistic competency is an important part,” Zenick said. “But the other part is the idea of cultural literacy.”Zenick explained that it’s not just a question of “Are you answering the question grammatically correctly?” but rather, “Do you have an understanding of the context in which the language is used?’”
The SFS describes a “pass” on the proficiency exams as comparable to achieving an intermediate-high to advanced-mid standing on the American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages guidelines, or a B1/low B2 in the Common European Framework of Reference.
But departments are largely left on their own to administer the exams, and many discrepancies persist, according to students and faculty interviewed for this article.
Professors acknowledged that communication between departments regarding proficiency exams is minimal.
“We have not had much contact recently,” Interim Chair of the French Department Deborah LeskoBaker said. “I think that departments are in general agreement about what it takes to pass the exam, but we do not regularly communicate with all other departments about what their specific levels of preparation are.”
Italian professor Anna de Fina, who coordinates the Italian proficiency exams, said she would like to see more coordination among departments, though complete coordination would be difficult and undesirable.
“I don’t feel that there is a complete coordination among the different departments,’” De Fina said.  “On the other hand, I don’t know whether you can ask every department to have the same because departments have different traditions of teaching, different standardized tests that they rely on, I don’t know to what extent you could make the case for having exactly the same level, or the same kind of exam even.”
In most departments, students speak for 20 minutes with two professors about an article they read before the exam and are asked to summarize the main idea, give their opinion and answer questions posed by the test proctor. Students also answer questions on more familiar topics, such as their personal and family lives. However, these guidelines are far from universal across departments.
Students who take proficiency exams in Italian do not have to read an article, while students who take the Chinese exam are given three hours to do so, in contrast to only 20 hours for those taking the Spanish exam. Students in the German department prepare a five-minute presentation on German current events, along with a discussion of an article.
Students suggested that languages typically thought to be harder for English speakers to learn, such as Chinese and Arabic, have less demanding exams.
Yomna Sarhan (SFS ’14), who passed both the Arabic and French proficiency exams, said the French exam was significantly more challenging.
“In the Arabic one, I was asked about my family, my hobbies and my favorite classes. It was much more conversational, while the French one was strictly about the assigned article and French domestic policy,” she said. “It seems that since Arabic is a harder language, the proficiency exam is less rigorous — the goal is just to get you to talk about yourself and your life. The French one, I found, was much more difficult and demanding.”
Juman Khweis (SFS ’13), who grew up speaking Palestinian Arabic and studied modern standard Arabic for three years at Georgetown, said she was surprised by the format of the language’s exam.
“They don’t test your writing skills and they ask you pretty basic questions about the article. My overall impression was that they just asked pretty simple questions so if you just remembered the vocabulary from your first semester of Arabic you would do a good job,” she said.
Rui Hao Puah (SFS ’16), who learned Chinese as part of his bilingual education in Singapore, said the Chinese proficiency exam was also fairly basic.
“The proficiency test is too easy,” he said. “Even after passing the test I don’t feel comfortable living in China and working there. I don’t feel proficient at all.”
For those who study more common European languages, the proficiency exam is a different experience.
“The French proficiency exam, at least, ensures that you are able to function in higher-level academic discussion and analysis of current events,” Allie Van Dine (SFS ’14), who passed her French exam, said. “I would say that it was a great measurement of my language skills, because it not only combined my ability to speak and read, but also analyze within the language and employ traditionally French frameworks for that analysis.”
Exams may also vary within departments, depending on instructors and subject discussed in assigned articles.
“It’s different teachers, it’s not the same and the passages are different. Every test has a different passage,” Puah said. “It depends on the teacher. You might get a lenient teacher, but generally the standards are the same.”

Jon Huntsman, former presidential candidate, governor and ambassador, discussed his vision for the future of the United States during a speech in Lohrfink Auditorium Tuesday evening.
In the aftermath of the Republican Party’s defeat in both 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Huntsman called for reform, especially regarding social issues.
“Let me just say this about my party, which I want to see succeed. We deserve better than what we’re getting today,” Huntsman said. “I’m embarrassed about what we’re going to hand over to the next generation.”
Huntsman, who supports certain liberal positions such as immigration reform and same-sex marriage, has drawn criticism from fellow Republicans. Huntsman, however, argued that such positions are aligned with original Republican ideals.
“If Abraham Lincoln were here, he would be arguing for the principals of equality under the law,” Huntsman said. “I think we should be promoting long-term, stable relationships.”
Despite criticism of his liberal views, Huntsman said he remains a committed conservative.
“I think we can get back to a party that is inclusive, that is courageous,” Huntsman said. “We have an obligation to your generation, and sometimes that doesn’t come through in our discourse.”
Huntsman, who served as a staff aide in the White House under Ronald Reagan, added that the U.S. political landscape is more partisan than in previous administrations.
“Republicans and Democrats would tend to pull together more,” Huntsman said. “I think that is still within us, but we’ve been divided.”
In addition, Huntsman, a former U.S. ambassador to China, discussed the relationship between the two countries, arguing that despite tension on issues such as Taiwan, it has seen marked improvement in recent years.
“Our shared values have yet to be defined in any kind of bilateral dialogue,” Huntsman said. “[But] it’s been the most profound change in international relations, I think, in the last 50 years. It’s akin to the end of the Cold War.”
Huntsman also spoke about improved relations with Myanmar, one of China’s key allies, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
“[Myanmar] was always the one issue that caused a rift in the ASEAN-U.S. dialogue, and that’s no longer the case,” Huntsman said.
Overall, Huntsman expressed optimism about the future of the U.S.-China relationship.
“I like Chinese food, so I call it kind of a sweet-and-sour relationship,” Huntsman joked.
Students were enlightened Huntsman’s insight on domestic and foreign policy.
“I think he really touched on the point that [the U.S.-China relationship] depends on what kind of leadership both the countries have in the future,” Harry Xu (SFS ’15) said.
Joshua Weiner (COL ’15), who voted for Huntsman in the 2012 Republican primary, agreed.
“I thought it was amazing, and I stand by my choice of Jon Huntsman in the 2012 election,” Weiner said. “He is still my favorite of the ones that ran.”

While the Georgetown Model United Nations team frequently travels to compete, its trips are usually limited to four-hour bus rides to Yale or the University of Pennsylvania. But last month, GUMUN flew 21 hours to Melbourne, Australia, for WorldMUN, joining nearly 2,000 students from 55 countries to debate world issues.
The conference, sponsored by Harvard University, marked the first time Georgetown, the top-ranked North American team for the past two semesters, has attended a conference outside North America.
“WorldMUN … brings together the greatest assortment of college students from around the globe to engage in cultural exchange, diplomacy and cooperation,” Georgetown team member Anais Carmona(SFS ’14), who has attended 13 college Model UN conferences, said. “This one was an experience that I don’t think I will ever have in any other conference we go to, as diverse as our circuit in the [United States] is.”
During the five-day international conference, attendees represented countries in committee sessions in order to create UN resolutions, a process that involves extensive debate and compromise. For example, Tanzanian students represented Chile, while Georgetown students represented France; each had to advocate accordingly for their respective countries’ interests.
“It’s about finding out what international politics and negotiation and cooperation are really about,”Carmona said.
Team members said the largest difference between national MUN conferences and the WorldMUNevent was the award structure. According to team member Jeffrey Caso (SFS ’15), national MUNevents are known for rewarding individual team success, whereas WorldMUN rewarded those who demonstrated the best diplomacy and collaboration.
“You’re really there to foster relationships and friendships and have that cultural experience,”Carmona added.
For example, Carmona spoke of her experience with a group of Venezuelan students the week following former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez’s death.
“During lunch, we said, ‘Hey, we know this might be uncomfortable, but what is it like over there right now?’” Carmona said. “They were so happy to be able to talk about it and were so happy we were interested in it.”
In addition to debating major world issues with peers from across the globe, students also received the opportunity to explore Melbourne and to interact with each other in more casual settings.
“WorldMUN knew you only had a week in Melbourne, and they wanted you to see the city, so they would organize events at night all over the city,” Caso said. “It was very classy, and very professional. … You would see the people you had been working with all day long, and you’d say ‘Oh, I’ve seen you in a committee, you are representing Tanzania, where are you actually from?’”
Carmona said she enjoyed spending time with her fellow committee members over lunch, where they agreed to talk about anything other than Model UN.
“This is where China and France become friends, this is where we decide to meet up for dinner or before the ‘out-of-committee social experience’ that WorldMUN offers,” Carmona said. “Then, back into the grind of things for another two and a half hours —debating, caucusing, speaking and convincing the other delegates on a certain plan.”
To secure funding for the trip, the International Relations Club, which oversees GUMUN, began fundraising last year, using the Campaign for Georgetown as a model. Overall, the club received support from 12 donors, including the Office of the Provost and the Office of the President.
GUMUN attends six to seven competitions each semester. Earlier this semester, the team traveled to New Haven, Philadelphia, Montreal and San Francisco. The San Francisco conference was the team’s first trip away from the east coast.
“We are definitely a force to be dealt with,” Carmona said. “We are not only some of the best delegates on the circuit, but we also pride ourselves in being a family of Hoyas that have continued a tradition of excellence and fun.”
According to Caso, GUMUN is already looking ahead to next year’s conference, whose location has not yet been determined. Caso said that the team hopes to attend WorldMUN again, perhaps with a larger group.
“We’re going to try next year to start fundraising really early with the community, law firms, whomever we can receive donations from, because we want to make this a sustainable practice,” Caso said.

The School of Continuing Studies will move to its new location in Chinatown in downtown Washington, D.C., this fall, over a year after signing a 15-year lease in July 2012.
According to Lauralyn Lee, associate vice president of community engagement and strategic initiatives, the move from M Street to a 91,000 square-foot campus at 640 Massachusetts Ave. NW was chosen for convenience, as it has parking close by, is located near the Circulator bus route and is accessible by all Metro lines. SCSadministrators declined to comment on the price of the lease.
The search for a new location began about four years ago due to higher enrollment than expected in its master’s programs, SCS Interim Dean Walter Rankin said. Moving graduate students to a downtown campus is also a component of the 2010 Campus Plan agreement.
“Originally, we thought that our public relations and corporate communications [program] would have maybe 25 to 30 students, and that program has been extremely popular with close to 300 students,” Rankin said. “We really needed to find a new location where we will have classrooms and spaces for students to meet.”
However, SCS Senior Associate Dean Jim Parenti expressed concerns that SCS students could miss out on the traditional Georgetown experience with the new downtown location.
“It’s a shiny new building, and it’s sometimes harder to get a feel for Georgetown, where you already have these fantastic older brick-and-mortar buildings,” Parenti said. “When you get into the new space, you want to keep the feeling of … what it means to be a Georgetown student.”
The new SCS facilities will include study rooms, a 130-person auditorium, a digital media lab, a library resource center, a bookstore and several lounge and meeting areas. In addition, the campus incorporates features not available on the main campus, including an Apple computer lab and a broadcast studio that will allow faculty to record live videos. All classrooms are also fitted withEcho360 Lecture Capture, which both SCS and the main campus currently use.
Parenti expressed confidence that the new building will carry on the Georgetown tradition.
“I think that this new location is all about new possibilities for our students, state-of-the-art facilities — really an opportunity to learn and study in a world-class environment in the fastest and most productive area in the city,” Parenti said.
Parenti added that the new location would allow graduate programs to engage more fully with social justice by being in close contact with service organizations in the neighborhood.
SCS Chief of Staff Christina Roberts said that the influx of 1,100 degree and 2,000 non-degree students, 300 faculty and 100 administrators and staff into the neighborhood would change the nature of the area, especially its commerce.
“As far as outreach to the community, we’ve been fortunate to be welcomed by the Business Improvement District,” Roberts said. “They’ve welcomed Georgetown with open arms, looking for ways to cooperate with the community in terms of meeting space, events and industry connections for our students.”
Rankin noted that the LivingSocial headquarters, the Urban Land Institute, National Public Radio and the Newseum, all located nearby, tie specifically into various programs in the SCS.
Lee said that the SCS administration hopes that its new downtown location will mirror the success of the Georgetown University Law Center. Although the law school originally began with one building, it has since developed into a multi-building campus by Capitol Hill.
“It will really benefit the students and also the city as we continue to enhance our footprint there,” Lee said. “We believe the enhanced presence downtown will benefit our students, who will appreciate the accessible urban location and will bring further vibrancy and opportunities for growth to an area of the city that is quickly developing.”
In addition to expanding its downtown presence, SCS will add two master’s programs in urban and regional planning and emergency and disaster management.
According to Rankin, SCS chose these programs because they involve fast-growing, high-profile industries that often require master’s degrees for career advancement.
SCS, which utilizes practice-oriented curriculums for its programs, will continue its commitment to applied education and research opportunities through these two programs. For example, the emergency and disaster management program will partner with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, immersing students in the field before graduation.
Rankin said that students would also benefit from studying abroad at the School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar.
“Both these programs fit terrifically well with the movement of the entire world,” Rankin said. “Since we already have a campus in Qatar, we can look at the potential risks of hosting something like the World Cup, or how to prepare for the tragedy in Boston, how to prepare for multicultural issues and look at how they’re building an entire infrastructure in Qatar.”

Vice President Joe Biden described the benefits of increased U.S. engagement in Asia in an address at The George Washington University on Thursday afternoon.
Biden cited three American goals in the region during his speech, which was sponsored by the Center for American Progress: stronger alliances, a new defense strategy and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement. He said that the United States would focus on proliferation, human disasters, conflict between nations, the threat posed by North Korea and the risks of disrupting commerce.
“In the Asia-Pacific, we saw a region of remarkable promise, but also genuine uncertainty and political risk,” Biden said to an audience of 250 invited guests, including Indian Ambassador to the United States Nirupama Rao.
Biden specified the payoff of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as part of the pivot to Asia, suggesting that its benefits would bolster stability and increase prosperity in both Asia and Latin America.
“To spark new growth, there has to be fewer barriers at and behind our borders, protections for intellectual property to reward innovation, new commitments to make sure everyone plays by the same rules because that’s what attracts investment and jobs, as well as greater economic integration,” Biden said.
The vice president, who will travel to the subcontinent and Singapore next week, pointed to the growth of India while outlining policy implications for specific countries in the region.
“Twenty, even 10 years ago, some might have suggested that India be left out of discussions about the Asia-Pacific,” Biden said. “[Today] India is increasingly looking east as a force for security and growth in Southeast Asia and beyond.”
Biden also spoke to the health of the U.S.-China relationship.
“We do not view our relationship and future relations with China in terms of conflict or the talk of inevitable conflict,” Biden said. “We view it in terms of a healthy mix of competition and cooperation. A competition that we welcome; it’s stamped into our DNA.”
The vice president addressed fears in some European capitals that the pivot to Asia will mean fewer resources for U.S. efforts in the Middle East.
“Europe, just like us, will benefit greatly as well from stability in the Pacific, in Asia. And by the way, there is no reason why we cannot bring greater focus to the Asia-Pacific and keep our eye on the ball in the Middle East,” Biden said. “Folks, that’s what big powers do. To use the vernacular, we can walk and chew gum at the same time.”
Georgetown associate professor of international relations Michael Green, who also serves as vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Biden was trying to reaffirm that American interest in Asia remains high, despite turnover at the State Department.
“There are real questions out in Asia about who will champion Asia policy and the pivot after Hillary Clinton and Kurt Campbell,” Green wrote in an email. “Beijing is telling the smaller ASEAN states that America comes and goes, but China will always be there, so they had better rethink who their real friends are.  In that context, Biden’s attention to the region is welcome, but is it enough?”
Biden concluded his speech with a defense of economic and political freedom — and a plug for the administration’s economic policy.
“We’re better positioned than any time before to be able to do it all. I know you’ll think it sounds like a campaign assertion I’ve been making for years, but America is back,” Biden said. “I think it’s because of the enduring strength of our people and of our system. For all our difficulty in education for our children, they’re still taught to challenge orthodoxy.”

The Hoya’s editor-in-chief, Danny Funt, sat down with Thomas Banchoff, Georgetown’s first vice president for global engagement, last week to discuss Banchoff’s new role on campus.

Below is an excerpted transcript of the interview.
What does a global university look like as you and Dr. DeGioia envision it?
We are already a global community and a global university in many ways. But we are also in a competitive global context. In the context of globalization, with the world more interconnected, the higher education sector is becoming much more competitive and the competition for the best students, the best faculty, for research grants on international topics has grown more and more intense, so being a global university has to be positioning us in that space, strengthening our existing global programs and initiatives and finding ways to support our faculty and administrators as we deepen and strengthen our global profile.
Was there anything specific that prompted creating this position now?
We are already a global university, we’ve emerged as a leading global university under PresidentDeGioia, but we can’t rest on our laurels. There is a lot of competition out there. This position is designed at this moment to strengthen our overall efforts to support faculty and students and connect their efforts as well so that we can collaborate more effectively as a community.
How does Georgetown’s religious identity play into how it approaches global engagement?
The idea that we are training students not just to be successful professionally but to give back, to serve the wider community, to be skilled in ethical reflection and intercultural communication. That is really the heart of the Georgetown identity and experience. I think it should and it does infuse everything we do not in a doctrinaire way, not in a narrow way, but in the way we have seen over the last couple of decades, in particular under President DeGioia and his predecessors. Georgetown is a Catholic and Jesuit institution open to other religious traditions and the wider world.
The elevation of Pope Francis brought a lot of global attention to the Society of Jesus. Does his global popularity affect the way that Georgetown proceeds in developing its international ties?
There is definitely some impact, or I should say there will be some impact. Things move slowly with the new papacy. These are large structures like Georgetown that have been around a long time and how this specific Jesuit identity will play out as supreme pontiff and how that will play out for Georgetown, we’ll have to wait and see. So far, he has made a point of emphasizing Jesuit spirituality in his own life and in his reflection on world affairs and the challenges of his office. In there already you see a great connection with Georgetown and the role that Jesuit spirituality plays in our community and in the wider tradition.
Is there any worry that the university’s attention is being diverted from that undergraduate experience?
It’s critical that this new role and everything we do around global engagement strengthen our core academic enterprise — the teaching and the research mission of the university. Georgetown is a student-centered research university. So it is a kind of a litmus test. If we are in China or Latin America, if we are expanding our partnerships with universities abroad, we’ve got 250 or more [memorandums of understanding] with universities in some 40 countries. We have to keep asking ourselves how does this benefit our students, how does it create opportunities.

The trek from the Hilltop to Chinatown for Georgetown men’s basketball games has been blamed for lackluster student attendance, and three athletic department initiatives this season aim to help fill up seats at Verizon Center.
A direct busing program from campus to the arena, a mobile ticketing service and a minor expansion of student section seating at games will all be instituted this basketball season.
The shuttles — operating on a pilot basis this season, with potentially expanded service in the future — will supplement the regular practice of increased Georgetown University Transportation Service buses running on game days. Because D.C. traffic patterns are expected to make bus travel slower than Metro travel on weeknights, the program will operate primarily for weekend and holiday games.
However, not all students will be eligible to participate in the pilot program. In an apparent effort to incentivizeattendance at non-conference games, the athletic department will offer bus vouchers only to students who attend either two out of the first three games or half of all non-conference games.
“Eligible students will be notified via email and given three to five days prior to game day to pick up their direct bus voucher,” said Pete Kirschner, the athletic department’s senior director of marketing.
Kirschner left the door open for expansions of the program, provided that it’s successful this year.
“It is important to note that this is a pilot program that, if found to be enjoyed by the majority of student season ticket holders, can be expanded in the future,” he said.
Once they arrive at the arena, students will notice a change at the door: For the first time, students will be able to gain admittance using their iPhone, Android or Windows smartphones instead of theMyHoyas season ticket card, which will not be continued this season. Students without smartphones will be able to either print out tickets or download tickets to credit or debit cards — an option that was available last season. Students will still be able to transfer individual game tickets to other students’ accounts, which became available last year.
Executive Director for Ticket Operations and Donor Relations Steve Alleva compared the new smartphone system to those used by airlines for mobile check-in.
“We’ll be creating user-friendly how-to guides,” Alleva said. “You’ll go to your online MyHoyas account through your smartphone, and that will bring up a QR-like code that will be scannable at the Verizon Center.”
The third change instituted this season concerns the student section itself. In an effort to make a “more intimate” atmosphere, the seats allocated to students will include all of sections 105 and 106 — commonly known as the “non-pep band” side — as well as rows CC-KK in section 117 — the “pep band side.”
This represents little change from past years, except that the athletic department will not close off the pep band side during games not anticipated to draw large crowds, as it has done on occasion in the past. Excess students will continue to be placed in sections 424-427, and no student will be denied the opportunity to buy season tickets.
“We’re students. We want the student section to be as intimate, as rowdy, as fun as possible,” Hoya Blue Vice President Rachael Augostini (COL ’14) said. “I think the team will appreciate that as much as the students do.”
The new initiatives this season sprouted from talks over the summer between athletic department officials, Hoya Blue and the Georgetown University Student Association.
The bus conversation in particular arose after GUSA Vice President and former Hoya Blue board member Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14) realized how popular the idea was during the 2012 GUSAexecutive campaign. Rather than attempting to start a new system through GUSA, he talked to his contacts in Hoya Blue and the athletic department to see how older, failed attempts at direct busingcould be revamped in a successful way.
“It was the first time that GUSA had somebody with previous ties to the athletic department,” Ramadan said. “And the athletic department had an infrastructure in place. So rather than reinventing the wheel, why not take advantage of what we already have, and make more students aware of it?”
The athletic department has a clear impetus for making games more appealing to students this season in particular: This year’s schedule, partially due to the conference move, lacks many of the big-draw games from years past.
With the marketability of games against Butler, Creighton and Xavier an unknown quantity — and juggernauts like Louisville and Syracuse off the schedule — Hoya Blue and the athletic department are banking on a simplified approach bringing in more fans. Ramadan, for one, thinks it’s a winning bet.
“We’re in kind of uncharted territory, but I’m personally very excited,” Ramadan said. “I think the busing is a home run — it’s just a matter of making sure student know about it.”

To most Georgetown students, a semester away from campus immediately equates to a semester abroad. But some students from other universities instead come to Washington, D.C., for the Semester in Washington, D.C. Program to reap the benefits of District life that Georgetown students often take for granted.
SWP, run through the School of Continuing Studies since 2003, attracts between 200 and 300 students each year. Participants take classes at the SCS campus in downtown Washington, often complete internships and take part in specific programming. Most students live in downtown D.C. in housing at New York University’s D.C. campus.
“We’re having guest speakers come talk to us about things that I find really interesting that I didn’t even know until I came to this program,” Seth Bynum, a junior at Vassar College who is currently enrolled in SWP, said. “It’s extremely helpful in helping us figure out what we want to do with our lives.”
In particular, participants’ semesters often begin with a particular introduction to D.C. This fall, SWP students heard Obama’s and civil rights leaders’ Aug. 28 speeches on the National Mall commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington.
In the past, students have also attended events with entrepreneur Bill Gates and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and have engaged the program’s partnerships with the National Press Club and Politico.
The students, however, have minimal interaction with main campus; Bynum said he has been to the Hilltop only once in the month he has been in D.C. The SCS’s move downtown from its former M Street location this fall has further decreased the likelihood that SCS participants will find reasons to come to the Georgetown area.
But D.C. and its opportunities, rather than the Hilltop, are the main attraction for SWP students, most of whom are juniors and seniors, although the program is open to all college students. Recent years have seen an uptick in international student participation, particularly from China and Latin America.
Applications to the program require transcripts, recommendations and a personal essay about professional development and the program’s connections to students’ courses of study.
SCS Senior Associate Dean and Chief Administrative Officer Jim Parenti emphasized the importance of the program’s ability to connect theory and application by prioritizing the connection between academics and work experience.
“Our program allows students to see that coursework works with internships, rather than on top of them,” Parenti said.
Julie Hutchinson, a junior at Haverford College and an applicant to the program for the spring semester, said this focus on interning was a factor in her decision to apply to Georgetown’s program, as opposed to other D.C. programs.
“You’re doing an internship and having that experience, as opposed to having just classes at another university,” Hutchinson said.
Brian Bentley, a senior from Point Loma Nazarene University who is currently enrolled in SWP, agreed.
“It provides a really good atmosphere to get engaged with work and really build a foundation for networking and professional skills,” Bentley said. “If you take that challenge and you think critically and apply that same critical thought process to your internship, to your classes, the experience starts to build on your knowledge.”
Bentley added that Georgetown’s reputation played a large role in his decision to come to SWP.
“Finding an opportunity to attend Georgetown University for a semester, I didn’t want to turn that down,” Bentley said. “It’s something that most people don’t get an opportunity to do, and I was very blessed.”
Jen O’Neil, a graduate from Boston College who participated in SWP in spring 2011, agreed.
“Having that Georgetown name meant that the people we got to meet were just far superior to anybody else,” O’Neil said.
O’Neil’s original SWP internship with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.) turned into her full-time career. She now works as Johnson’s scheduler and executive assistant.
This exposure to future career paths is a hallmark of SWP, compared to more traditional study abroad programs.
“The contacts I have in this program, I’m going to be in contact with them in the long run, maybe for the rest of my life because they want to do the same things I want to do,” Bynum said. “The people I’m meeting … they become professional contacts that I’llable to call on in the future.”
Many SWP participants cite these opportunities as factors for choosing a study exchange program in the United States rather than studying abroad.
“I think it’s a more productive experience — I have friends in New Zealand and Europe who are country-hopping on the weekends,” said Bynum, who was originally going to study abroad in London. “Other than getting the experience of going to another place, there is not much that is productive or will actually help them in the long run.”
Overall, O’Neil expressed satisfaction with her experience at Georgetown and in D.C., although she had originally been hesitant about taking a semester away from her alma mater.
“I wanted to know, that at the end of my senior year, when I graduated and went out to the workforce or decided to apply to grad school, I could say that I took every opportunity to make the best of my four years. I was thinking about staying in school and taking as many cases as I could,” O’Neil said. “But then I found out about the Semester in Washington Program. … Semesters like that are really what I was looking for to make the most out of my college career.”

At least half of Georgetown undergraduates will venture off the Hilltop to study abroad during their college career. But while opportunities in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and France remain popular, more and more American students are exploring less traditional destinations in Asia and the Middle East.
In November 2012, the Institute of International Education announced in its Open Doors Report that China, now ranked just behind those four European options, has jumped in popularity as a study abroad destination. Other countries with significant gains included Brazil, Costa Rica, India and South Korea.
Director of Overseas Studies Craig Rinker said that Georgetown is consistent with the national trend, which he attributed to increased accessibility and the expanded global nature of academia.
“Europe is where study abroad was founded, but as the world becomes smaller, students are drawn to newer locations,” Rinker said. “Particularly as academia becomes more global and more academic disciplines address global issues, students are going to find ways to go to those areas of the world they are studying about.”
To students, emerging study abroad destinations in Asia and the Middle East can be more exciting than their more established European counterparts. For example, Sarah Wang (SFS ’14), who lived with a host family for a year in Tokyo, stressed the “once-in-a-lifetime” chance that many non-traditional study abroad options present.
“Asia is kind of the place where if you have a chance, you should go,” Wang said. “When you talk about it later in your life, it’s really awesome to say, ‘I went to India’ — not that France isn’t [great], but it’s just different.”
Michael Paslavsky (COL ’14), who studied abroad in Dublin, said that although he was satisfied with his experience, he understood the appeal of Asia.
“Growing up, it wasn’t that unusual to go to Europe, so I think Europe is often viewed more like a vacation place,” Paslavsky said. “Japan is so far away, so when you are given the opportunity to go there, it’s Georgetown students doing what they normally do, seizing an opportunity.”
Study abroad destinations are often closely tied to students’ academic interests, particularly foreign languages; those who plan to study abroad in Asia often enroll in intensive programs to gain proficiency in the local language in preparation. These study abroad programs offer cultural and language immersion as a key component for reaching fluency.
“People who study abroad in Asia generally are focused on becoming fluent in their language, but for me I just wanted a different type of people, a different type of culture, and that wouldn’t be defined by a language,” Paslavsky said of his time in Dublin.
But as Asia grows in popularity as a serious study abroad option, Europe’s “touristy” reputation deepens, thanks to its familiarity.
“You kind of know what you’re getting when you go to Europe,” said Matthew Serrone (COL ’14), who previously visited Europe but chose to study abroad in Japan instead. “They often very much cater to Americans who want the European experience without fully diving in. There are definitely cultural differences, but I don’t think they’re as extreme. People, I think, want something more unknown, unexpected.”
Rinker agreed and added that there is sometimes an unnecessary stigma attached to European study abroad programs.
“We have many students on campus who look at what they’re studying and their language preparation and have it intimately tied into Western Europe, for instance, and there’s nothing wrong with that,” Rinker said. “I think oftentimes the thought now is that you can’t be current or the cutting edge by sticking to Western Europe.”
The Chronicle of Higher Education also recently reported that the recent economic downturn in Europe and the relative economic rise in Asia have affected schools’ ability to fund such study abroad programs, both stateside and abroad.
According to the Chronicle, Asian countries have continued to invest in higher education, while European university budgets have been continually slashed as Europe battles its recessions.
“With few exceptions — notably Germany — institutions lack the deep pockets needed to fuel international activities,” the Chronicle reported.
James Burr (MSB ’14), a finance student who studied abroad in Barcelona, chose to study in Europe during the recession, however, to observe the recession’s effects on the region.
But while Burr agreed that Europe has become touristy, he argued that it falls on the traveller and the student to seek the local experience in any city.
“It’s like Washington, D.C.,” Burr said. “If you’re a tourist, you’re not going to find The Tombs.”
Rinker emphasized that Europe still provides a valuable cultural experience.
“There are significant nuances to living in Europe, and I think sometimes because there’s a common language, people devalue those nuances,” Rinker said.
Another unique feature of European study abroad programs is the ease with which students can travel between countries. In contrast, students who study in Asia generally stay in one particular country because they are often limited by transportation methods and cost.
“Asia is not the type of place where you can country-hop on weekends like Europe,” Kristin D’Alba (COL ’14), who studied abroad in Shanghai last fall, said. “You really do stay in the local area, but I like that because you get to really know one city.”
Overall, despite the national trend toward non-traditional areas, Rinker said that Georgetown would continue to seek new study abroad sites based on fit, rather than trend.
“We’re hoping that programs are relevant to what’s currently happening in the world, and there is a demand from students for it,” Rinker said. “Part of the challenge is that you want to ensure that there’s quality and that experiences can be managed in terms of student support and in terms of health and safety. We’re very intentional about the programs that we develop.”
Rinker added that despite the slow move away from European study abroad experiences, Europe will always be a valued player in the world of academia.
“As the world becomes a smaller place, I think more and more students will consider studying in countries that may not have been so prominent 10 or 15 years ago, so I expect Latin America, Asia and Africa to continue to grow. But I don’t think you’ll ever see a decrease in demand for the more traditional locations like Europe,” Rinker said. “Just because Europe is accessible doesn’t mean that it’s easy and that there’s not cultural value there or academic disciplinary value there.”

Scott Malkin, chairman of Value Retail PLC, emphasized the value of female consumer demographics throughout his talk Tuesday afternoon in Fisher Colloquium.
The Undergraduate Business Program Office, the Distinguished Leaders Series and the McDonough Retail and Luxury Association sponsored the event.
Value Retail, which owns nine luxury shopping malls in Europe, has been a pioneer in the luxury goods industry. The company is expanding, starting in 2014 with the opening of its first mall in Asia, located in Suzhou, China.
Less than a decade ago, luxury brands were quick to discard out-of-season merchandise. This process has quickly changed with the growth in popularity of luxury outlet shopping destinations.
“In the old days, companies would burn their surplus stock rather than let it get into the marketplace,” Malkin said. “Today, it is instantly available online.”
Value Retail has been able to capitalize on these luxurious outlet shopping centers.
Much of Malkin’s talk focused on how women were represented as consumer demographics.
“Retail is all about women. For women, shopping is substantially social,” Malkin said. “Men don’t price compare. … They just stumble through life.”
Value Retail focuses on creating a superior cultural experience for its customers, by thinking of the shopping experience as a form of entertainment. The company caters to a specific, affluent clientele with limited advertising and only high-end products.
“What we do is contrary to what is logical,” Malkin said. “Our target consumer is a woman with two or three friends who can enjoy a comfortable setting and a memorable shopping experience.”
Malkin also addressed the changing landscape of retail shopping and the difficulty Value Retail, which was founded in 1925, faces in adapting their business model of providing an “incredible shopping experience” to the Internet.
“The single most disruptive force in our world today and for the foreseeable future is the Internet,” Malkin said.
He also addressed topics other than Value Retail, providing a few career recommendations.
“Fortune favors the bold,” Malkin said. “Working hard isn’t as good as working smart.”
Vlad Kondratiuk (MSB ’15) was taken aback by Malkin’s diverse background and his accomplishments.
“After listening to Scott Malkin speak about his life, you really think about how unforeseen one’s future can be,” Kondratiuk said. “It is very hard to predict where life will take you in five, 10, 15 years.”
Anvar Khvan-Beiseuov (MSB ’15) said that Malkin’s talk provided him with insight into the luxury goods industry.
“Listening to Mr. Malkin speak has given me a glimpse of what the future holds for the fashion-retail industry,” he said.

Four years after University President John J. DeGioia’s Initiative on Diversity and Inclusiveness was launched, Georgetown continues to pursue a diverse pool of faculty members — a goal of the 2009 effort that has not been fully realized.
The degree to which they have fallen short of that target, however, is unclear.
Newly installed Vice Provost for Faculty Adriana Kugler said statistics on the racial makeup of Georgetown’s faculty are not publicly available, although The Hoya and other campus media have reported on the issue in the past.
In 2011, the percentage of minority faculty members increased from 12 to 14 percent, The Hoya reported in September of that year. Vice President for Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny told The Hoya at the time that two black professors, eight Asian professors and one Latina professor had been hired on the main campus in the first six months of 2011.
Kugler, a Colombian-American, said the faculty recruitment process can be ambiguous.
“It’s not obvious to everyone that [the process] is pretty involved and complicated,” she said. “The departments are requesting to review a vacancy and then the university as a whole decides the university’s needs and then the departments take control back, but still working jointly with [the university].”
Department hiring committees consist of three to five representatives from their respective departments and schools.
“Already at this stage we are working with the departments and schools at making sure that we get the very best people in these hiring committees,” Kugler said. “They are the faces of Georgetown out there to the media, and we want somebody to represent us broadly — diversity reflecting diversity.”
Professor James Sandefur, mathematics and statistics department chair, said that there was a fine line between imposing a quota on a department and the active recruitment of faculty within his department.
“I think that you actively recruit, but you try to make sure it’s somebody that you really want,” Sandefursaid. “So if we have a choice between a minority or a white male and they were equal in all respects, we might lean toward the minority faculty for the diversity issue.”
For the past few recruitment seasons, departments have submitted recruitment plans accounting for diversity to the Office of the Provost. Professor YuYe Tong, chair of the chemistry department, remembers participating in a few preliminary committee discussions about increasing diversity but said that the conversations failed to yield any follow up or incentives. Racial diversity within the chemistry department, he said, has increased naturally as they hire the best candidates available rather than as a motivated effort to improve statistics or quotas.
“We hire our top candidates. If it happens to be a minority, that’s good. If there were two candidates who were otherwise equal we might put a preference on the minority,” Tong said. “We’re conscious of diversity when we’re looking at the pool of candidates and debating, but we would never move them up because of it.”
Since 1999, the chemistry department has conducted 13 tenure-line faculty searches and hired four long-term, non-tenure-line faculty members. Among these hires, he said nine were minorities.
“Chemistry is independent of culture. Everyone writes the same reaction equations and deals with the same material,” Tong said. “However, [diversity] brings a more culturally rich environment. It’s always a good thing to have a diversified faculty group for the department and the students to have the benefit of multiple perspectives.”
Psychology Department Chair Professor James Lamiell said that his department has engaged in recruitment of more minority faculty.
“We do actively recruit in these ads in places where we think that they would get the attention of minorities,” Lamiell said.
Linguistics professor Deborah Tannen, who wrote an article on counteracting first impressions, applied that research to the Georgetown’s interview process.
“You have to actively recruit and also step back and second guess your own first impressions,” Tannen said.
While Tannen, Sandefur, Lamiell and Kugler agreed that increased efforts are needed for minority recruitment, Lamiell described the faculty demographic today as promising.
“I’m in my 32nd year at the university, and the picture is much better and healthier than it was three years ago. Progress is being made,” Lamiell said. “Are we where we need to be or where we want to be? No. But obviously the effort is there.”
Sandefur agreed and recalled the homogeneity of the math department faculty when he arrived at Georgetown in the mid 1970s.
“I came here in ’74, and it was essentially all white males at that point,” he said. “Embarrassingly, we were the last department to hire a female, which happened several years ago.”
The mathematics department currently has 17 tenure-line or renewable contract faculty, five females, three black faculty members, two of whom are female, one Hispanic faculty member and an Iranian faculty member. Sandefur also mentioned that the department has many international faculty members, from China to Africa to the Middle East.
However, both Lamiell and Sandefur noted the absence of racial and other minority diversity within their respective departments.
“We are not where we would like to be in terms of racial diversity,” Lamiell said, referencing one former African American professor who has since left the university.
Moving forward, Singer said greater diversity within the department would create more role models for students.
“I think the answer is to continue to try and generate as many applications as possible. Make sure we don’t miss applications from diverse faculty and get as broad a pool of applicants as we can,” Singer said.

A female motorist was fatally shot Thursday afternoon by police when she attempted to pass a barricade on Capitol Hill, prompting a chaotic day of uncertainty and fear for the worst in Washington.
Miriam Carey, a 34-year-old dental hygienist from Connecticut, knocked down a security barrier at the entrance to the White House at 15th Street and E Street NW before accelerating down Pennsylvania Avenue with police in pursuit around 2:15 p.m.
After trying to ram the gate of the Hart Senate Office Building, located at Constitution Avenue and Second Street NE, she was shot and killed. Carey’s 1-year-old daughter was also in the car but emerged unharmed.
The story was initially reported as a shooting at the Capitol, although Carey was later found to be unarmed. Police had fired shots at her car as it sped away.
Due to the day’s events, the Georgetown University Law Center campus was placed on lockdown, along with the Capitol and several other buildings in the area. The shelter-in-place warning was announced through HoyAlert.
“As in any emergency that might affect our community, the Georgetown Law Department of Public Safety followed the events at the Capitol this afternoon closely,” Law Center Director of Media Relations Marisa Kashino wrote in an email. “Overall, operations were affected minimally, since thankfully, the situation was resolved quickly. As always, we will be reviewing our procedures and policies to look for ways to improve our capabilities to respond to future emergency situations.”
HoyAlert, the university’s go-to method of announcing emergency protocol, had some concerning hiccups during the crisis.
Jordan Grushkin (LAW ’15) was in class when he got his HoyAlert text around 3:03 p.m., nearly an hour after the chase began. By that time, the city lockdown had already been lifted. Twenty minutes later, Grushkin was told that the situation was clear and that he could resume normal activities.
“I was in class the entire time, so I was kind of already in a position where everything was secure,”Grushkin said. “Honestly, it wasn’t a big deal, procedurally, but then again, I was already kind of locked in, in class.”
Ashley Kempczynski (LAW ’15), who lives across the street from the Law Center campus and is signed up for HoyAlert through text, phone and email, did not receive any notifications.
“I didn’t even know it was happening,” Kempczynski said. “I started to go to class around 3:15 p.m., and I met up with a friend in the elevator, and she said, ‘Oh yeah, I hope it’s safe to go outside now,’ and I didn’t know what she was talking about.”
Kempczynski added that she finally received an email around 7 p.m., although the time stamp stated that it was sent at 3:30 p.m., at which point the city lockdown had already ended and the House of Representatives had reconvened.
Students at internships on or near the Hill were also affected. Nesh Patel (SFS ’16), who works as an intern near the Capitol, was at work when the incident happened.
“We were getting information before it even got on CNN, so I was going online and trying to see what the news said about it, but it said nothing when we knew about it,” Patel said. “Most of us were just calling our families and texting them, saying that there was a shooting and we were okay. [My supervisor] said we couldn’t leave the building.”
After School Kids Program’s Street Law program, usually held at the Law Center, was called off as a result of the shooting.
“The students were on their way to the courts, I believe, but they were all fine,” ASK mentor AliciaWun (COL ’16) said. “They were most likely in transit when it was resolved. We usually pick them up from the courts [by Chinatown], not the Law Center, so they probably weren’t in as close a proximity as if they were at site.”
Grushkin said that such occurrences are not very uncommon, particularly in the Capitol South area.
“We’re not exactly in the safest area; we are right by the Capitol, but we are also right next door to one of the largest homeless shelters in the U.S.,” Grushkin said. “There has been more than one gun-related thing where someone had a gun drawn on them.”
“It was scary,” Patel said in agreement. “It’s weird that this kind of stuff has been happening in D.C. a lot now.”

Dolcezza Artisinal Gelato
1560 Wisconsin Ave. NW
$$$$
Dolcezza Artisanal Gelato has many of the features of a coffee shop but focuses on something sweeter. Its gelato, with flavors like maple syrup and Madagascar vanilla, are fresh, tasty and well worth their high-end prices. ThoughDolcezza has a location in Georgetown, its Dupont Circle store has the seating and space that allows for a productive afternoon with lots of studying and delicious treats. The space has one large table in the center with many chairs around it where you can sit amongst others. If you’re looking for more privacy, however, there is also a bar by the window. One thing Dolcezza lacks is Wi-Fi; computer users may find this problematic, but those who need to do some reading may enjoy the forced break from the web. For those who would prefer something sweet to something strong while getting down to work, Dolcezza acts as a nice alternative to the traditional coffeehouse.
 
Chinatown Coffee Co.
475 H St. NW
$$$$
At Chinatown Coffee Co., java is no joke. The coffee selection at this cafe changes every week and features beans from all over the globe; the barista will prepare them in a French press or by hand pour upon request. Regardless of the way the the coffee is made, it will be strong, flavorful and satisfying. Everything about this coffee shop feels straightforward — no artsy decor, no elaborate menu and no expensive prices. Although there are plenty of seats, it might be difficult to find an empty one but once you do, it’s pretty easy to dive right into studying. For one, almost all of the customers have laptops out, taking advantage of the free Wi-Fi. The music, which sounded like a Rolling Stones Pandora station, never gets too loud, and the ambience is pleasant without being hectic. If you find yourself lacking motivation, you’ll definitely find some at Chinatown Coffee Co., either from a cup of Joe or the productivity buzzing around you.
 
Tryst
2549 18th St. NW
$$$$
Located in Adams Morgan, Tryst calls itself a coffeehouse, bar and lounge. Unlike most coffeehouses, however, Tryst has table service. This may, at first, startle those who have been conditioned to Starbucks, but it makes for a more luxurious studying experience. The music sets a great, relaxed vibe for the cafe, but it may get a little loud for someone who wants to focus. In the same way, art lines the walls, giving the place charm but also providing studiers with many other places to look besides their notes. The menu includes an expansive selection of reasonably priced salads, sandwiches and small plates, as well as many desserts and drinks. The waiter will stop by every so often and ask if you want anything else. And whether it’s their signature lavender hot chocolate or one of their delicious sandwiches, chances are you will enjoy an indulgent break from studying.
 
Soho Tea & Coffee
2150 P St. NW
$$$$
Those who like a homey study environment may find it in Soho Tea and Coffee. From its festive red and yellow walls to its friendly staff, this cafe in Dupont Circle feels cozier than most other coffee shops. It has a large menu of sandwiches, sweets and drinks, which are in Mason jar mugs. With their coffee, they avoid the typical and instead introduce new flavors like the Bahama Mama, a coconut and banana latte. The coffee shop gets a lot of students and people looking for a place to work, and they seem equipped for the task. If you plan on using a laptop, Soho asks for a minimum purchase of $5 to use the Wi-Fi. Soho Tea & Coffee doesn’t close earlier than midnight all week, meaning customers can stay for long stretches of time to get work done. Overall, this cafe provides most of the amenities a studier could want, along with warmth, character and charm.

For many upperclassmen, serving as a teaching assistant provides a fresh perspective on the classroom.
Unlike graduate students, who are often required to be a TA as part of their research or fellowship, undergraduate students choose the position themselves.
“I love it actually; it’s like one of my favorite things. I like it more than the classes I am taking, and it’s actually really fun,” Probability and Statistics TA Patrick Owens (COL ’14) said.
For Crystal Huang (MSB ’16), a teaching assistant from China, being a TA for a Chinese class gives her a unique perspective on how outsiders see her culture.
“I come from China, and I think it’s really fascinating to see my fellow American students learning Chinese,” Huang said. “I think we have a great Eastern language department, and it’s been a great opportunity to get to know faculty members.”
Matthew Howard (COL ’14), found his time as a TA for both an introductory biology course and an ecology course a useful review of his own knowledge.
“It’s kind of a combination of looking at it from a teaching perspective and then also going through the material again; for me, I found it pretty helpful for studying for the MCAT,” Howard said.
The desire to review the basics spans disciplines. Conor McNulty (COL ’14), an economics major, wanted to be a TA to review the foundations of his major.
“I think it is a great opportunity to teach, but I think it shows really well how you understand something if you can teach it to someone else,” McNulty said.
Oded Meyer, professor of mathematics and statistics, uses exclusively undergraduate students as teaching assistants. When he was first hired, the department gave him graduate TAs, but Meyer chose to switch to undergraduate TAs for his courses.
“I find the undergraduate students to be very loyal, very enthusiastic, and I’ve always had good experiences with undergraduate TAs,” Meyer said.
Meyer also believes that it adds to the undergraduate experience by opening an opportunity to see class from a different perspective.
“It really enriches the undergraduate student’s experience in college to be on the other side and to be part of a teaching team of a course, even if it is only a TA and grading, you are on the other side,” Meyer said.
Owens chose to be a TA because he aspires to be a teacher.
“I want to teach high school math, so I figured this would be a good experience and sort of give the inside scoop for what it is like to be a teacher,” he said.
As undergraduates, many believe that they have a better understanding of the students and what they may be struggling with compared to the graduate students who are TAs in departments such as government, philosophy and the physical sciences.
“A lot of the time, since we have taken the classes that we are TAing for, we know the ropes and the tricks,” Howard said.
Many undergraduate teaching assistants see this as a strength of undergraduate versus graduate TAs.
“I think being a student and not so far removed from having taken the class yourself actually makes undergraduates better TAs for some of these basic courses because sometimes graduate students haven’t taken the course in a while and sometimes it may be a little more challenging for them to understand why someone doesn’t get such a basic concept,” McNulty said.
However, the connection between upperclassmen teaching assistants and their students can make it difficult when grading.
“Needing to grade things is difficult because if you have a personal connection to your students, which I did, and it’s really difficult to dock major amounts of points if you know that they did something wrong, but you still really want to support them through the class,” Lena Bichell (COL ’15), a biology teaching assistant, said.
Requirements for becoming a TA differ widely across departments. While several departments, including Chinese, economics and math, have application processes, TAs in the biology department are chosen directly by professors.
The responsibility of teaching assistants also differs with department. In biology, the TAs assist labs under professor supervision, while economics TAs run recitation sessions independent of professors.
With responsibilities varying greatly, teaching assistants are also compensated in different ways for their services. TAs in departments such as Chinese and economics receive payment, while biology TAs may be eligible to receive credit for an introductory biology course or payment, depending on the class for which they are a TA.
For some, like “Introductory Biology” TA Elizabeth Tubridy (COL ’14), the position comes with less tangible benefits.
“I kind of wanted to do it just as a chance to get to know my professors better and also to give back to the program,” Tubridy said.

	National Security Advisor Susan Rice discussed the future of the Asia-Pacific and announced in Gaston Hall on Wednesday that President Barack Obama would visit the region in April.	Obama’s scheduled trip in October was canceled due to the government shutdown.	“Rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific remains a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s foreign policy. No matter how many hot spots emerge elsewhere, we will continue to deepen our enduring commitment to this critical region,” Rice said. “Our friends in Asia deserve and will continue to get our highest level of attention.”	Rice laid out the Obama administration’s plan for the next three years.	“Ultimately, America’s purpose is to establish a more stable security environment in Asia, an open and transparent economic environment and a liberal political environment that will respect the universal rights and freedoms of all,” she said.	Rice said Obama would focus on four areas to build growth in Asia: enhancing security, expanding prosperity, fostering democratic values and advancing human dignity.	“Our military presence in the region is vital,” Rice said. “Not only to deter threats and defend allies, but also to provide speedy humanitarian assistance and unmatched disaster response.”	Rice specifically addressed China in terms of security and asserted that the United States remains committed to improving its military relationship with the nation.	“When it comes to China, we seek to operationalize a new model of major power relations,” she said. “That means managing inevitable competition while forging deeper cooperation on issues where our interests converge in Asia and beyond.”	Rice, who previously served as ambassador to the United Nations, related her experience on the UN Security Council to future work with China.	“I sat on the Security Council of the United Nations with China for over 4 and a half years working on many of these issues,” she said. “I know all too well that we have some fundamental differences that cannot be minimized. But I also know that our interests on many of the major challenges of our time can and should be more closely aligned.”	Specifically, Rice said the United States and China should work together to rollback the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction programs.	“We are prepared for negotiations provided they are authentic and credible, get at the entirety of North Korea’s nuclear program and result in concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization,” she said.	Rice also discussed the economic outlook for the region in the years ahead, citing that about a quarter of U.S. exports go to Asia.	“By the end of 2016, we aim to transform our economic relations with the region, through dramatically increased U.S. exports, the implementation of the most ambitious American free trade agreement in decades and closer cooperation with China, India and other emerging economies in pursuit of sustained global growth,” Rice said. “As an Asian-Pacific nation, the United States is working to shape a more dynamic future for entire region by promoting U.S. business and forging new ties for commerce.”	The most crucial economic policy, according to Rice, is the Trans-Pacific Partnership economic agreement.	“The rules we establish though this agreement will set standard for future trade agreements,” Rice said, citing workers rights, environmental protections and intellectual property, among others.	Rice said that the United States needs to improve its economic relationship with China, saying a poor relationship is detrimental to each nation.	“If meaningful action is not taken now, this behavior will undermine the economic relationship that benefits both our nations,” she said.	As for women in politics, Rice said decreasing the gender gap remains key to fostering economic growth.	“This single change has the potential to do the most good for the greatest number of people,” she said. “Those two factors are closely correlated – simply put, the smaller the gender gap, the stronger the economic growth.”	Rice concluded by addressing the United States’ response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.	“We are working around the clock to help Filipino people begin rebuilding the country. Recovery will be a long process, but the U.S. will stand beside the Philippines every step of the way,” she said.	Audience members were impressed and optimistic about what Rice said for the Asian region moving forward.	“I was especially interested with how Rice addressed increasing the participation of women in the workforce in Asia,” Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said. “Especially after the Hilary Clinton talk last week, I found the emphasis on the advancement of women in Asia to be very interesting.”

Recent graduate Jeff Stefanis (MSB ’13) is revolutionizing the way Washington residents get around their city by introducing Riide, a company that that will sell moderately priced electric bikes that double as bicycles.
“We saw an opportunity, and we decided to make our own electric bike, specifically designed for young urban commuters, as a quicker and less expensive way to get around the cities,” Stefanis said. “What we’re really excited about our bike is that it’s a relatively light bike that maintains the traditional feeling of riding a bicycle.”
The startup will begin fundraising on Kickstarter next week. The page will provide a description of the bike andRiide’s goals.
Stefanis drew inspiration for Riide, cofounded with The George Washington University graduate Amber Wason, after witnessing the proliferation of electric bikes in China.
The electric bike, priced at $1,799, can travel up to 20 miles per hour thanks to a four-pound battery located inside the frame of the bike. The battery lasts about 20 to 25 miles per charge and can be charged at any wall socket in about two to three hours.
Stefanis plans to cater to the District but has hopes to integrate with the Georgetown community, as Georgetown and the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative have been assets to Stefanis andRiide’s conception.
The Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative has been instrumental in the support and development of Riide. The program exposed Stefanis to courses and mentors, in addition to providing seed money for opportunities to pitch business ideas.
“Jeff is the kind of guy you want to root for, and his passion for transforming urban transportation is palpable. I predict that Riide will be very successful,” Jeff Reid, the founding director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative, said. “He is using the power of entrepreneurship to create meaningful change in American cities and help alleviate problems such as pollution and traffic congestion.”
For students, Riide will be a useful alternative to the limited public transportation in the D.C. area.
“I think it’s a really good idea, especially because public transportation is really crowded and somewhat unreliable,” Alex Garvey (MSB ’17) said. “I think that if I lived in D.C., I probably wouldn’t want a car just because it would be a big hassle, and I would probably take public transportation, but if there were the bike option, I would definitely consider it.”
Despite the possible utility of Riide, the price of the bicycles remains an important consideration for students on a budget.
“Cost is a big factor. As an urban youth, I may not be able to afford an electric bicycle,” Matt Hinson(SFS ’17) said.
According to Sustainability Fellow Greg Miller (SFS ’14), the option of Riide gives students familiarity with bicycling, thus making the mode of transportation more attractive.
“More and more people are going to ride bikes versus take other forms of transportation cause it really is mostly about convenience and easy access,” Miller said. “[D.C.] is a really bicycle-friendly city; there are a lot of routes for cyclists.”
Ultimately, Riide aims to change the convenience and efficiency of public transportation in cities.
“We really think that electric bikes are not only the quickest way to get around a city, but also the least expensive and most efficient way,” Stefanis said. “We hope to change the way people think about transportation.”

Gary Bass, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton, presented his most recent book, “The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide,” on Thursday at the Mortara Center.
The book provides the first full account of the role that former President Richard Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger played in the 1971 genocide that resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of people and over 10 million refugees fleeing from Pakistan to India.
“In this case, the [United States] is intervening from the beginning, on the side of the military dictatorship engaged in crimes against humanity, against its own population,” Bass said.
On March 25, 1971, the West Pakistani army – Bangladesh was then part of Pakistan and known as “East Pakistan” – participated in one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the century. They launched a strict crackdown, Operation Searchlight, on ethnic Bengali civilians in East Pakistan after demands that the West Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 Pakistani democratic elections.
“No country, not even the United States, can prevent mass genocide wherever it happens,” Bass said. “But this is a case where the atrocity is being carried out by a close U.S. ally that prizes its relationship with the Untied States.”
Kissinger and Nixon were allegedly aware of the situation as the United States Foreign Service informed them and numerous cables were sent back to the United States with documentation.
Archer Blood, an American diplomat in Bangladesh, sent a strongly worded telegram, written by himself and other Foreign Service officers, which came to be known as the Blood Telegram.
“Our government has failed to denounce atrocities. … We, as professional civil servants, express our dissent with current policy and fervently hope that our true and lasting interests here can be defined and our policies redirected,” the telegram read.
According to Bass, the ambassador to India, Kenneth Keating, even confronted Nixon and Kissinger about the genocide against Hindus in the area.
“Kissinger makes it clear that he knows about, not just killings, but the targeting of Hindus,” Bass said.
The United States also supplied weapons to West Pakistan. Furthermore, when war broke out, the United States did not press West Pakistan not to use weapons supplied by the United States, did not impose conditions for using the weapons and did not publicly condemn them.
“There are U.S. tanks rolling through the streets of Dhaka. There are U.S. jeeps with U.S. machine guns mounted on them shooting at civilians in Dhaka,” Bass said. “You might think this is foreign policy on auto-pilot. But, in fact, Nixon and Kissinger are very engaged in South Asia.”
Nixon and Kissinger, against a strict Congressional arms embargo, sent weapons to assist the West Pakistani army, which killed countless Bengali civilians. Against persistent advice from advisors in the White House, Nixon and Kissinger proceeded with the shipment of weapons through Jordan and Iran.
“They don’t make appeals to theories of executive power,” Bass said. “They don’t ask for a memo explaining why this is part of commander-in-chief authority.”
According to Bass, White House tapes reveal that, in a meeting before they decided to send the weapons, Nixon asks Kissinger, “Henry, is it so much against our law?” After Kissinger explains that it is, Nixon responds, “Hell, we’ve done worse.”
Attendees found Bass’ discussion both informational and entertaining.
“I just find it fascinating, especially with the White House tapes,” Jonathan Kennedy (GRD ’14) said. “Never before has there been such an accurate portrayal of what the most powerful leaders in the [United States] were talking about and it really adds some unique insight.”
Bass pointed out that it was also strategically unwise to supply weapons to West Pakistan. Once India’s military got involved in December of 1971, it was clear that India would prevail.
Bass also attempts to understand why Nixon and Kissinger would support West Pakistan.
“To be fair, the opening to China is a huge and important achievement,” Bass said. “It helps to win the Cold War and end the Vietnam War, and I want to give full credit to Nixon and Kissinger for that.”
Bass also pointed out that the main reason Nixon supported West Pakistan was because he feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would lead to Soviet domination in that area. This would undermine the power of the United States in the world as well as the power of America’s new ally, China.
Bass debated both sides of the war, highlighting the complexity of the issue. He pointed out that Nixon and Kissinger’s goals came at a price for Indians and Bangladeshis.
When asked whether Kissinger commented on the book, Bass said that although Bass did not receive a response from Kissinger on his book, Bass did attempt to get his opinion.
“I work very hard to present all perspectives but Kissinger ignored me three times, and turned me down once,” Bass said. “But he’d be stupid to respond because then it would create a news story.”
According to Bass, the book gives a deeper insight on the issue of why Nixon and Kissinger took risks to equip West Pakistan with weapons. Although it was perceived as statistically and morally unwise, he explained Nixon and Kissinger’s behavior from a different angle.
“Nixon and Kissinger were often propelled by emotion, instead of calculations,” Bass said.

As area universities fall victim to sophisticated cyberattacks, the University Information Security Office at Georgetown remains vigilant in its attempts to combat the 2.4 million attempted intrusions Georgetown’s network faces a day.
“The entire environment of cyberattacks against higher education has just simply changed. No longer sort of this lone wolf creating nuisances or viruses, it really is sophisticated, foreign, government-sponsored and organized crime rings that are now focusing their attention on colleges and universities,” Deputy Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson said.
While 28.3 percent of the attacks are based domestically, an additional 14 percent come from China and 6.4 percent from Russia, according to Georgetown statistics.
The University of Maryland was the latest school to be targeted, after a cyberattack Wednesday compromised the personal records of more than 300,000 students, faculty and staff on its College Park and Shady Grove campuses. The database holds information dating back to 1998.
The database breached contained names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth and university identification numbers, but no financial, health, academic or contact information.
“I am truly sorry. Computer and data security are a very high priority of our university. … We recently doubled the number of our IT security engineers and analysts. We also doubled our investment in top-end security tools. Obviously, we need to do more and better, and we will,” University of Maryland-College Park President Wallace D. Loh wrote in a press statement Wednesday.
The incident coincided with the recent implementation of mandatory bi-annual password changes for all Georgetown students, faculty and staff. In an email Wednesday, Chief Information Officer Lisa Davis wrote that the change was spurred by “increasingly sophisticated phishing and cyberattacks” on Georgetown and other universities.
“We’re just such attractive targets because we have so much data, so many different kinds. It’s kind of one-stop shopping from the point of view of the hacker,” Associate University Information Security Officer Judith House said.
According to Nicholson, hackers are attracted not only by personal information, but also by research information and potential information about intellectual property. Nicholson believes the recent attack at U-Md. resemble the phishing attacks on Georgetown students, faculty and staff in deliberateness and complexity.
Nicholson emphasized the value of risk management and improved practices and procedures for dealing with more advanced threats in maintaining a “balance between openness and security” at Georgetown. Over the past two years, the university has been mitigating risk through the ongoing monitoring of university systems and networks, regular security reviews, system evaluation and analysis.
“It is about risk management, so we do various things here in UIS to really protect the data of the institution. So, on-going monitoring of our systems and our networks. We do regular security reviews so that we can know where the risks are, and we can then proactively mitigate those. So, I think in this case, understanding the risks and then putting in place the best practices and procedures to protect our environment is really our goal right now,” Nicholson said.
The new bi-annual password has been met with a less than enthusiastic response from students.
Christine Kalpin (SFS ’16) saw the change as a mark of inefficiency on the part of university administration.
“I’ve gotten so many spam things, and I feel like they tell me to change the password so many times, so I feel like they need to increase whatever they’re doing, try better measures of combating this,” Kalpin said.
Nevertheless, administrators expressed confidence in the policy as one way to reduce the risk of attack.
“Every computer and every device is an entry point to our network and the best protection is for us to do the pain-in-the-neck things that are securing our passwords. … I do understand that it’s a nuisance, but we really need you to be our partner on this,” House said.
In response to the breach at U-Md., House also encouraged students not to click on links in emails, share personal information over phone, email or text and to delete texts from unfamiliar numbers or names.

The second annual China-U.S. Forum, co-hosted by the Georgetown University Chinese Students and Scholars Association and the School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program, involved discussions on changes to economic and global governance patterns Friday in Lohrfink Auditorium.
CSSA Chair Miaomiao Shao (GRD ’16) emphasized the importance of examining the relations between China and the United States.
“The goal of the forum is to provide a unique platform for policymakers, business leaders, scholars [and] students to discuss current issues regarding China-U.S. relations in the area of economic, political and cultural cooperation,” Shao said. “We are so lucky to have so many distinguished speakers with us here today.”
Victor Cha, the director of the SFS Asian Studies Program, served as the moderator for the event. Cha introduced David Dollar, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy and Global Economy and Development programs at the Brookings Institute. Dollar is a preeminent scholar on China’s economy and relations with the United States.
Dollar’s opening talk focused on China’s growth model. He expressed a desire that that the model will contribute to a strong foundation for China-U.S. economic relations.
“China’s obviously had a very long and successful period of economic growth. It’s grown at an average rate above 10 percent for three decades,” Dollar said.
Dollar drew connections to his previous experiences overseeing economic development in Japan and South Korea, countries that both share a similar growth model to China. Although there were commonalities between the three economically successful Asian nations, Dollar did note that certain parts of the Chinese experience are unprecedented: high levels of investment have been critical to the Chinese economy, more so than the technological growth that provided the surge for Japanese and South Korean sectors.
Dollar tempered his report of China’s unprecedented growth, warning that the economic model for China is also unsustainable.
“When you are so dependent on capital accumulation, you end up seeing diminishing returns to capital,” Dollar said. “The model is running out of steam. Investment is still going up, but growth is slowing down. It’s taking more and more investment to grow at slower and slower rates.”
While Dollar noted that the growth model had been successful in poverty reduction, the negative environmental externalities and the unsustainability of the system remain major flaws in need of reform.
He identified four specific features of the Chinese fiscal growth system that need reform in order to free China’s economic sector: the household registration system, financial repression, a large state enterprise sector and the one-party system.
Dollar affirmed current legislation promised by the Chinese government — such as opening up the economy to foreign investment — as positive actions if implemented.
After Dollar’s presentation, three panels were introduced to fill out the remainder of the seven-hour event. The first panel was focused on new trends in global economic patterns and China-U.S. cooperation. The second panel dealt with China-U.S. relations as a whole, including cultural and military aspects. The final panel helped develop the issue of social welfare and development in China.
There were over 50 people in attendance at the event, though attendees migrated in and out of the seven-hour forum. Despite minimal attendance from undergraduates, graduate students, primarily from the McCourt School of Public Policy, largely populated the event.
Students pointed to the opportunity to see experts from other schools as a highlight of the event. Claire Peng (GRD ’17) also appreciated the interaction and debates between the different professors at the forum.
“Most people would think economic growth results in more pollution, but [the professors] kind of disagreed with each other. There were a lot of debates, but it’s very interesting to see how they get their conclusions,” Peng said.

Just as the university wrapped up its first GAAP Weekend for students through accepted early action Sunday, 2,277 high school seniors began receiving word of their regular decision admission to the Class of 2018.
Out of 19,501 total applicants, 2,277 were accepted through regular decision. The overall admission rate in the combined early and regular decision cycles was 16.6 percent, slightly lower than last year’s 17 percent for the Class of 2017.
The McDonough School of Business was once again the most selective school with an acceptance rate of 16 percent, slightly higher than last year’s rate of 15.7 percent.
“There has been more growth in the MSB than other schools, and partly that is because of job opportunities,” Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) said. “The yield is pushing up towards 60 percent in the MSB. Perhaps the MSB pool is a little more self-selective and less dependent on financial aid, so people have the ability to say yes more easily.”
Georgetown College admitted 16.4 percent of applicants, slightly higher than 2013’s 16.3 percent acceptance rate. Both the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the Walsh School of Foreign Service admitted 17.5 percent of applicants, slightly lower than last year’s rate of 17.7 percent for the NHS and 18.7 percent for the SFS .
The number of first-generation college students leveled at 12 percent, the same as last year, a number which, according to Deacon, is consistent with national trends.
“Colleges are recruiting harder in that population to bring more equity, and there is a lot more attention given to it. Kids in first-generation backgrounds are beginning to believe they have that chance,” Deacon said. “We have some pretty good partnerships with scholarships and that helps us get students in the pool that might not otherwise apply to Georgetown.”
Additionally, the accepted class is 56 percent female, two points lower than the national average of 58 percent female.
California and New York were again the two most represented states in the admitted class, with 391 and 382 students, respectively. New Jersey had the next largest representation with 259 admitted students.
Although Georgetown admitted students from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and 64 countries, the percent of international students, at 8.5 percent, saw a nearly three-point decrease from last year’s pool. The majority of international applicants came from South Korea, China and the United Kingdom, respectively.
Deacon attributed this decrease in admitted international students to the total decrease in international applicants, down 10 percent from last year.
“We may have hit a ceiling, or at least a pause, in this growth of international applicants. It could be the law of averages catching up to us,” Deacon said. “Our staff is going to India in the next couple of weeks, and that we see as an area to grow more in terms of applicants.”
The acceptance rate for minority students increased 0.6 percent from last year’s record number of 39 percent to 39.6 percent. Within individual minority groups, there was a 4-point bump from 2013 in the number of accepted students who self-identified as Asian-American, from 13 to 17.3 percent. Ten percent of admitted students identified as African-American, a slight increase from last year’s accepted class of 9 percent, while almost 12 percent of accepted students identified as Hispanic, up slightly from 11 percent. At 7 percent, the rate of students identifying with multiple ethnicities remained the same as last year.
Georgetown still distinguishes itself from peer universities by remaining separate from the Common Application and requiring an alumni interview. According to Deacon, the separate application process results in fewer applicants every year and consequently a higher acceptance rate compared to peer institutions such as University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College and Emory University, which had admit rates of 12.3, 10.4 and 26.5 percent, respectively, according to their websites.
Accepted Georgetown student Sian Rigby praised the university’s separate, unique application.
“I enjoyed the personal ‘Georgetown touch’ apparent in the application. Georgetown has been my dream school since middle school, and I felt I could demonstrate that sentiment more effectively with the Georgetown application than I would have been able to through the Common App,” Rigby wrote.
According to Deacon, Georgetown offered 2,123 students spots on the waitlist this year and expects to accept around 50 waitlisted students in May after deposits have been sent for a target class size of no more than 1,580 students, in accordance with the 2010 Campus Plan Agreement’s cap of 6,675 undergraduates.
Over the next few weeks, the university will push to woo accepted students through alumni-sponsored receptions across the country and the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program events running throughout the month of April leading up to the May 1 decision date. Last year, 47.4 percent of accepted students in the Class of 2017 enrolled in Georgetown.
With one GAAP weekend already held, some prospective students already find themselves attached to the Hilltop.
“GAAP weekend was incredible. I already loved Georgetown, but GAAP weekend convinced me that extra little bit I needed that it would be worth it to fly all the way across the country to come here. It was the most well-organized, well-planned open house I’ve been to, and I enjoyed it thoroughly,” said Aislinn McNiece, an accepted senior from Lafayette, Calif.

As research, recruitment, and faculty and student interest from China continues to grow at Georgetown, administrators are looking to build greater ties with China through Weibo, a Chinese social media site that works much like Twitter.
“Georgetown University is the leading university in Washington, D.C., and in the country in terms of its focus on China,” Supervisor of Academic Programs at the Asian Studies Program Robert Lyons said.
Aside from academic ties, Georgetown additionally holds strong community ties with China. Students from China make up the largest international population at Georgetown. China also serves as one of the top 10 destinations for student study abroad.
Georgetown first established its Weibo page in 2011, becoming one of the first universities in the United States to do so. Associate Director of International Initiatives Tuoya Wulan is heavily involved in the page’s development and continues to work on social media outreach in China.
“Engagement with Chinese social media is to build the university’s brand in China, to reach out to prospective and current students, parents, alumni and other interested visitors and to increase awareness of the student life on campus as well as teaching and research of Georgetown faculty,” Wulan wrote in an email.
According to School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program Assistant Director Kat Harrington, the connection augments student learning as well as the university’s engagement with China.
“Through these social and academic initiatives, Georgetown is diversifying opportunities for its students interested in China. They provide ‘real world’ learning to complement the textbook learning on China,” Harrington wrote in an email.
The page also provides a space for Georgetown students and alumni to share personal stories.
The group also fosters connections among Hoyas abroad. For instance, a McDonough School of Business alumnus who is a food critic living in Shanghai, reached out to visiting MBA students through Weibo in order to take them out on a local food tour during their Global Residency Program in Shanghai.
Since the launch of Georgetown University’s account, the Law Center’s Graduate Admissions Office, Chinese Student Alliance, Chinese Student and Scholar Association and Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs have established their own Weibo pages.
While the Chinese government blocks social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, the domestic Chinese-language network offers an uncensored platform.
“Neither the Berkley Center’s Weibo page nor the university’s page has encountered any issues with censorship thus far,” Wulan wrote.
The center has little cause for worry anyway, as its page’s content is far from controversial. The Berkley Center’s Weibo page first launched in order to share a resource page that the center developed on religion in China and the United States. It continues to post news links, faculty research and relevant publications.
Director of the Berkley Center and Vice President for Global Engagement professor Thomas Banchoff believes Georgetown’s location and value system make it an ideal institutional partner for Chinese students and universities, but the Georgetown community stands to learn just as much from China.
“There is a lot that Georgetown students and faculty can learn about history, culture, religion, politics, science, business and other topics in China. … We look forward to continuing the two-way flow of students between Georgetown and universities across China,” Banchoff wrote in an email.
The university is looking to develop even more Chinese and foreign language pages outside of Weibo. Currently, a general university Chinese intro page and a Chinese info page for the Master of Science in Foreign Service program exist.
“A lot can be lost in translation in terms of meaning, significance,” Lyons said. “I think it’s useful that the university’s keeping up with trends that are currently going on in China and just because having an insight of culture, having experts in the field really helps us engage better.”

Monday marked the first day of the 2014 Indian general election, which will span a record 36 days, culminating May 12. Voting will take place in all 543 constituency districts of India to elect members of parliament in the Lok Sabha, which will determine the new prime minister. Students are raising awareness for the election, which may have serious repercussions for Asia and the world.
On April 3, the government department paired with the Georgetown South Asian Society to sponsor the event, “Indian Elections 2014: An Interactive Panel Discussion” at the Mortara Center. Government professor Matthew Rudolph moderated the event, which featured presentations by associate for the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Milan Vaishnav, former U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh Howard Schaffer and Indian political author, journalist and visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University Kota Neelima.
“I hope that this is part of a wave where we see more student and university interest and effort in India. China always gets the limelight when we refer to Asia, and I for one and students supporting this event would like to see some balance,” Rudolph said.
The focus of the event was to discuss the electoral prospects of the main political parties, and to determine what the results could mean for India’s relationship with the United States. There are two frontrunners for the position of prime minister: Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi.
Gandhi’s incumbent Congress Party, supported by the poorest factions of Indian society, focuses on welfare initiatives and increased socioeconomic mobility. Gandhi himself is the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has dominated Indian politics since independence. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party runs on a platform of good governance and economic development, hoping to expose the alleged corruption and wastefulness of the Congress Party and current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s coalition government.
The BJP is favored in the election, as Vaishnav explained that Indians care most about economic development and corruption.
“When the Indian voter is asked, the single most important thing is the economy. Number two is corruption, and number three is inflation,” Vaishnav said. “Because the Congress hasn’t performed well on these issues, the BJP have attacked the incumbents on these core tenants and have focused their platform on these issues.”
Although the BJP are expected to win the most seats of any party in the Lok Sabha and lead a coalition government, the many regional parties whose major voting bases consist of lower-caste, working-class Hindus and Muslims will ensure that a variety of parties hold a sizable presence in the parliament. It will be up to the BJP to convince some of these crucial smaller parties to join them in order to cross the 272-seat mark and effectively form a majority functioning coalition in the Lok Sabha.
Vaishnav explained the collaboration between various parties in terms of political and security motivations.
“In the case of Tamil Nadu, a southern state, political leaders entering the coalition would want the major party to let the foreign policy dealing with Sri Lanka, which has an ethnic Tamil majority, fall to their state,” Vaishnav said.
All three panel experts predicted that Modi will win the election — what this will mean for U.S.-Indian relations is up for debate.
“Modi’s party will want good relations with the United States, as most Indian leaders have in the past. However, in the past six months, relations have soured a bit due to the arrest of Indian Consular Officer Devyani Khobragade in New York City on charges of visa fraud and making false statements to the U.S. State Department about her work,” Schaffer said.
Despite this scandal, the relationship between the two major powers looks to remain a strong and vital partnership for years to come.
Luis Joy Pérez (SFS ’17), one of the approximately 40 students in attendance, came away from the panel discussion with a better understanding of the Indian political system.
“I am now able to better comprehend the issues of India’s election and why the media has been portraying Narendra Modi as the heir-apparent for New Delhi,” Pérez said.
SAS Marketing Chair Mariam Matin (COL ’15) was happy to see that students were developing an interest in foreign electoral races.
“It was exciting to see the room filled with a combination of people both directly invested in the elections and people who were just curious to learn more. I think people got a good idea of some of the key trends at play for this election,” Matin said.
Yash Johri (SFS ’17) from Delhi, India, is a research assistant under Rudolph, and helped arrange the event. He agreed with the panel’s conclusions.
“I think that it will be a coalition government because I don’t think that any party will attain a majority. Modi’s party has captured the imagination of the youth interested in the main issues. What he’s focused on is economic development and not the regional or religious issues,” Johri said. “This election is more about the shortcomings of the incumbent party. The rampant corruption and mismanagement of the past five years is the main talking point for Modi and the reason why he will win.”
He hopes that the panel will create greater interest in India from the Georgetown community.
“This event is the beginning of a larger effort to bring India to Georgetown and to the D.C. community in particular. While I see an immense amount of emphasis laid upon studying China as the next great hegemon, having been in Washington for over eight months I have sensed that India’s presence isn’t really felt, and I feel it is important to educate the community on India’s importance in the world,” Johri said.

Georgetown has now concluded the admissions period for the upcoming school year, with the addition of 110 students off the waitlist to the Class of 2018.
The university offered spots to 140 of approximately 250 waitlisted students, resulting in a yield of 78 percent. In an initial round, 60 students from the waitlist were accepted in May, and the rest were notified through the June 30 deadline.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions uses the waitlist to fill in the class once the regular decisions have been sent out. Last year, 80 students were accepted from the waitlist, with 72 deciding to enroll.
“A lot of it is looking at where we need to fill in students,” Senior Associate Director of Admissions Melissa Costanzi said. “We look at areas in particular where we need to put people in — if a particular school came in low or a particular major within a school where we have an enrollment target came in low, we would look to do it that way.”
Often, Costanzi explained, the waitlist candidates are just as strong as the students accepted in April. 1,525 of the 3,232 students accepted in December and April submitted deposits by May 1.
“The waitlist is always made up of very qualified students and, typically, it’s just that we don’t have enough room to admit all of the qualified students who apply,” she said.
The Class of 2018 now has representation from all 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and 43 countries. In May, the class did not have any students from South Dakota but was pursuing one off the waitlist, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon.
Costanzi pointed to geographic diversity as an important goal for the university in the admissions process.
“It’s important to us because we feel we represent the nation and the world as a whole,” she said. “We want to be a representation of the country and of the world.”
The addition of the 110 students changes the geographic demographics of the class, with New York overtaking California as the provider of the largest number of incoming freshmen. Other states with high numbers of attending students include New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland.
The incoming class of freshmen is 14 percent Asian-American, 10 percent Hispanic and 8 percent African-American. International students make up 7 percent of the class.
Students accepted from the waitlist expressed a variety of reasons for pursuing Georgetown even after being waitlisted.
Mary Marchese (COL ’18), who is from Longmeadow, Mass., was notified of her acceptance by the admissions office in early May. She was set to attend Boston College in the fall, and while satisfied with her commitment, Marchese still pursued Georgetown.
“I knew Georgetown was the place for me all along,” she said.
After her acceptance, she joined the Facebook group for the Class of 2018 and felt immediately welcomed.
“I felt immediately that I was part of a community. I didn’t really feel that I was left out of anything,” Marchese said. “The university as a whole did a nice job in welcoming me.”
Jenny Liang (COL ’18), an international student from Shanghai, China, was also accepted off the waitlist. She ascribed her continued interest in Georgetown to the school’s international appeal, pointing specifically to a Chinese section on the university website.
“That’s the only school of all the schools that I applied to that had a Chinese version of the website,” she said. “My parents can also get information about the school online. It’s very cool.
Kathryn Threatt (SFS ’18) was accepted off the waitlist in May. From Richmond, Va., she was originally slated to enroll at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
“I had a roommate and housing [at Chapel Hill], but I wasn’t happy,” she said. “I wanted to be in D.C. and Georgetown was my number one.”
For Threatt, diversity and the campus feel were a big part of her decision.
“I was ready for something more diverse — more diverse people, cultures and backgrounds,” she said. “And I really like the campus.”
Vanessa Sorentino (SFS ’18), from Brooklyn, N.Y., was accepted off the waitlist in early June and summed up the feelings of many members of the Class of 2018, off the waitlist or not.
“I’m very excited,” she said. “I’ve never been more excited for school to start.”

The Office of International Programs split into two offices this summer — the Office of Global Education, which will manage study abroad and international education, and the Office of Global Services, which will oversee the university’s global engagement and provide services for international students.
“This reorganization is the outcome of a year of reflection on how we can best facilitate the international work of students, faculty and staff,” Provost Robert Groves wrote in an email to the student body. “It will not disrupt existing processes and procedures.”
According to Director of Global Services Vanessa Meyers, the internal reorganization of the OIP will help the university keep up with its international growth.
“The rationale for the reorganization, which took place after months of consultations across the university, is the need to better support Georgetown’s growing international educational and administrative activities — activities once centered within OIP but now distributed within and among schools,” Meyers wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Dividing OIP’s functional areas into two new offices, while maintaining current staffing and location, allows both OGE and OGS to streamline their work in support of students, faculty and staff and to better support other units across the university.”
Vice Provost for Education Randy Bass said that the change reflects a shift in Georgetown’s international trajectory over the past 40 years.
“I think we felt that over that time, the world had changed, and the relationship of the globe to the university had changed,” Bass said. “Once upon a time, it made sense to have all of the international programs and business consolidated in one place. Since that time, Georgetown has become a global university with interests everywhere. We felt we needed a more robust and distributed structure to serve what had evolved into a much greater sense of Georgetown’s identity.”
The two new offices will serve distinctly different functions to accommodate the distinct needs of students who desire to study abroad and international students who have come to Georgetown. According to Bass, OIP’s staff, which has been split between the two new programs, is pleased with the reorganization.
“I think the reaction has been universally positive,” Bass said. “We’ve made sure that we engaged all the stakeholders around the university and there was no negative reaction that we encountered. People were concerned about one kind of service or another that they wanted to make sure continued in the excellent way that they had become accustomed, but I think everyone thought that splitting the OIP into the two distinctive divisions were both positive moves that would strengthen each of those two dimensions and better integrate them with other elements of the university.”
The OGE, according to Director of Global Education Craig Rinker, will work to enrich study-abroad experiences and provide support for students.
“Our intention is to continue to provide outstanding student advising and programmatic support while also positioning ourselves to adapt to innovative learning pedagogy that will define higher education at Georgetown for years to come,” Rinker wrote in an email. “Our hope is that the establishment of the Office of Global Education as a separate unit will expand our ability to support and enrich the international experiences of students while working with the four undergraduate schools to connect those experiences with the curriculum and co-curriculum.”
The OGS will continue to support current Georgetown international students, while adding new programs that bolster the university’s international engagement. Additionally, the OGS provides advice on a range of issues, such as global safety and relevant tax and finance policies, to administrators and faculty members conducting operations internationally.
“This reorganization has allowed us to strengthen the support we can give the Georgetown community in the following areas: global activities and operations; global partnerships and agreements; services for international students and scholars, teaching and research abroad with Georgetown; and international travel and safety,” Meyers wrote.
The new programs that the OGS plans to incorporate include training classes on faculty-led trips abroad, international collaboration and global operations policies, according to Meyers.
Rinker said that this split will not have a direct effect on students, but will instead push the university toward an even more global focus.
“Building upon our international character and expanding our global presence is a core aspect of our institutional mission,” Rinker wrote. “This reorganization is designed to recognize and support the significant international expertise of our faculty and the interest and engagement of our students, faculty and staff in global activities.”
Meyers agreed, and said that the reorganization will help Georgetown remain at the cutting edge of international programs.
“It is important for Georgetown to remain at the forefront of student learning including offering opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in diverse communities that provide significant engagement with different cultures and global issues,” Meyers wrote.
Karen Zhang (COL ’17), an international student from Beijing, China, said she experienced frustrations in working with the OIP, but hopes that the reorganization will help the OGS make some necessary changes.
“I think it’s going to be a really good thing because I don’t think that enough attention is paid to the needs of international students here,” Zhang said. “For example, when students move back in on campus after summer and winter breaks, there is barely any wiggle room and that’s extremely inconvenient for international students because we’re taking [long] flights two days before classes start. There is no attention paid to that.”
Livia Matteuci (COL ’16) is studying abroad in Chile now, and said that despite initial problems, the OIP has been extremely helpful and hands-on.
“I feel like the OIP office wasn’t very organized or clear before I left about what to expect or what was needed in terms of the application when I was applying,” Matteucci said. “Initially, it was pretty frustrating working with them, but since I’ve been here it’s been really positive.”
After two months in Chile, Matteucci said she feels well-supported by the OGE.
“I’ve been in Chile for almost two months now and have felt fully supported both with CIEE staff here in Valparaiso and also my study-abroad adviser and academic dean back at Georgetown,” Matteucci said. “It’s especially crucial that we have support not only for questions about credit transfers and the like, but more importantly for security and safety reasons. In the past week there has been an earthquake and two bombs in my area, and my family back home was immediately contacted to assure them I was safe.”

The Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs has partnered with the University of Notre Dame’s Center for Civil and Human Rights to create a new project, “Under Caesar’s Sword,” which will examine the growing issue of Christian persecution around the world.
The joint venture of the two Catholic schools has already received a $1.1 million grant from the Templeton Religion Trust and will send 14 of the world’s leading Christian scholars from universities across the United States to study in over 30 countries and present their findings at a conference in Rome in December 2015. Some of the countries include China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Egypt and India.
Notre Dame professor Dan Philpott proposed the idea after working closely with Berkley Center professors Timothy Shah and Thomas Farr on the Religious Freedom Project at Georgetown, and took the lead on writing the grant proposal.
“It is an effort to stand in solidarity with the persecuted Christians of the world,” Philpott said in a CCHR press release. “To advocate for the rights of Christians is not to claim that their human rights are more important than anyone else’s. Religious freedom is a fundamental human right to which everyone on the planet is entitled. Today, however, Christians constitute the lion’s share of those in the lion’s den.”
“Under Caesar’s Sword” aims to closely examine Christian persecution, how Christians respond to it and increase public awareness of the growing problem.
“We are providing the best possible scholarly analysis we can of what is going on. And this is an issue which is of enormous intellectual interest,” Shah said. “Christians are the world’s largest religious group.And a number of secular responsible analysts have pointed out that the group that’s facing the most harassment because of their religion is Christianity … and yet there’s very little scholarly study of this.And particularly very little study of what Christians are doing to respond to the discrimination and harassment and persecution that they’re facing.”
In addition to funding the research and sending the experts to over 100 Christian communities spanning the globe as long as a month, the grant will cover two additional measures geared toward increasing awareness.
“We have it as one of our official goals that our scholarship really have an influence on the world’s awareness of these problems,” Shah said.“Our second goal is public awareness. We want to increase the knowledge of relevant actors and parties of what’s going on … and we really want a big megaphone through which to announce our findings.”
In addition to the international conference, the project plans to fund another means for garnering the attention of the public.
“We’ll be spending a certain amount of money supporting the filming of a documentary which will be available, ultimately, online. We’ve hired a documentary film producer to travel to at least two or three countries where there is serious repression of Christian communities,” Shah said.
This project builds upon Berkley Center research fellow Rebecca Shah’s research, presented at the “Christianity and Freedom” conference in Rome in December 2013, which focused on the effect the conversion to Christianity had on the social and economic standings of Indian women.
Georgetown University Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., (CAS ’88) denounced the recent violence against Christians and explained that what students and faculty at Georgetown do is important in fighting religious persecution everywhere.
“The recent violence in Iraq against Christian minorities is only the latest in a series of attacks against Christian churches and people,” O’Brien said. “The targeting of any people because of their religion — whether Christian or not — is an affront against our common humanity as children of God. … What we do at Georgetown is part of the solution — teaching people how to talk across religious differences and learning how to join together for peace and solidarity against the forces of violence and division.”
Philpott came up with the name, “Under Caesar’s Sword,” and Shah expects it to be an accurate representation of the situation in many countries.
“The name is inspired by the reality, the very grim reality, that huge numbers of Christians face very real violence, repression and persecution at the hands of governments, i.e. Caesar, around the world,” Shah said. “Of course, the project recognizes that in many cases, it’s not official governments that are doing the persecution. In a number of cases it’s groups, non-state actors, terrorist organizations, extremist groups or grassroots uncivil members of society that are perpetrating the persecution. But in many cases, of course, it’s the government, hence the title, ‘Caesar’s Sword.’”

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak spoke about the future of Asia’s government and security in Gaston Hall on Tuesday.
Razak’s lecture, which focused on key issues such as the rise of China and the role of the United States in a multipolar international order, marked the first Lecture Fund event featuring a head of government this academic year.
“The way we respond to these issues will determine Asia’s future,” Razak said. “Confronted with the complex disagreements between states, Asia must place its trust in diplomatic solutions.”
Gaston Hall was filled with students as well as members of delegations from both the Malaysian and U.S. governments Tuesday.
After recognizing the past dominance of the United States on the global stage, Razak then discussed the emergence of many Asian powers including China, Japan and India, not only in regard to their economic transformation but also their political reforms.
“We must heed the fundamental principles upon which diplomacy is conducted: sovereign equality, respect for territorial integrity, peaceful settlement of disputes and mutually benefiting relations,” Razak said.
Razak, who came to Georgetown after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, also emphasized his personal connection to the university during his speech, praising the education two of his children received in the School of Foreign Service and reminding students to tread carefully, both on the Exorcist Steps and on the seal outside of Healy Hall.
The prime minister talked about the positive influence of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which Malaysia will chair in 2015. He asserted that the ASEAN code of conduct can help alleviate disagreements like those surrounding the territorial claims on the South China Sea.
Razak outlined key questions and issues that he believes will shape the future of Asia, regarding the rise of China and other nation’s reactions to Chinese leadership, the role of the United States in a multipolar world, and the shifting position of Japan in the 21st century.
After Razak finished his comments he spoke with US-ASEAN Business Council Vice President of Policy Marc Mealy. During this time, Razak condemned the actions of the Islamic State Group.
“They don’t speak for us. Whatever they are, and whatever actions they’ve done, they are against Islam, they are against God and they are against humanity,” Razak, whose country is primarily Muslim, said.
He stated that religious freedom in Malaysia has embraced the true ideals of Islam, which has resulted in over 40 years of peace and stability.
During a question-and-answer session following the talk, students asked Razak about issues ranging from the banned study of political science in Myanmar to his personal advice for young people.
One student questioned the heavy media censorship and the treatment of the ethnic elite in Malaysia, prompting a response from Razak that stressed Malaysia’s emphasis on democracy and an open society that can be clearly seen on social media.
Monica Mahal (COL ’17), who attended the event, said that she was impressed by Razak’s lecture.
“The prime minister touched upon a lot of themes that apply to all types of Georgetown students,” Mahal said. “He handled his questions very graciously, and he also shed light onto his personality which made the whole conversation much more enjoyable. … Overall it was really an informative and very enriching lecture.”

Around 200 protesters, including several Georgetown students, gathered at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office and marched to the White House on Wednesday night to demonstrate support for the Occupy Central protest currently occurring in Hong Kong, where 14 Georgetown students are currently studying abroad.
The rally was organized by Global Solidarity with Hong Kong, a political awareness group advocating for universal suffrage in Hong Kong. On Wednesday, Oct. 1, the National Day of China, the group held similar events supporting pro-democracy protests in 64 cities worldwide.
In Hong Kong, an estimated 150,000 protestors, including university students, have participated in sit-ins across the city’s main districts since Sunday, calling for the Chief Executive C.Y. Leung’s resignation and for democratic electoral reform. The protesters blame Leung, who was appointed to his position two years ago, for the current political stalemate, but Leung has refused to step down. The movement gained international media attention when riot police used tear gas and pepper spray to subdue the nonviolent protesters.
“Right now, the current situation [in Hong Kong] can be described as a war of attrition. It is a battle for the hearts and minds of the people in Hong Kong,” said Roger Li (SFS ’15), a Hong Kong native who participated in the D.C. rally. “I wanted to do as much as I could to show the world how polite and peaceful the protesters are in Hong Kong.”
Fourteen students in the Hong Kong Special Administration Region are studying with programs through the Office of Global Education, according to the office’s director, Craig Rinker.
According to Katy Berk (COL ’16), a former opinion editor for The Hoya currently studying abroad in Hong Kong, study-abroad advisers have advised Georgetown students not to participate in the protests and that it would be a violation of rules and could result in a loss of credits.
“Between that rule and the potential for violence, I’ve chosen not to attend the protests, though they’ve been quite peaceful and orderly since Sunday evening,” she wrote in an email. “The entire highway is flooded with people, the protesters are remarkably polite — serving each other free water, crackers, cool towels, hand sanitizers, even trays of McDonald’s — and there is a lively upbeat atmosphere.”
Michael Woo Cho (MSB ’16), another student studying abroad, said the protest he attended on Sept. 28 was the most violent.
“Tear gas came from everywhere and rubber bullets on the day after the protest, apparently. But people were helping each other out. Students, foreign and domestic, helped the wounded to the back and carried water, food, and medical [supplies] (masks, goggles and vinyl wraps) to the front lines and a lot of adults and old citizens were helping out, too. All for their democracy. An eye watering scene,” Cho wrote in an email.
In solidarity, the Washington marchers donned black apparel and yellow ribbons as they raised open umbrellas, which came to symbolize the movement in China after protestors warded off tear gas from riot police with umbrellas.
The D.C. event began at the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, where organizers distributed ribbons and flyers. Although ribbons were tied to railings outside the office, they were removed by the request of local police.
Around 7 p.m. Wednesday, the participants marched from the Trade Office to the front of the White House, raising signs and chanting along the way in both Cantonese and English. The chants mirrored those in Hong Kong, including “Democracy, Hong Kong” and “689 Resign.” In Hong Kong, “689” is a widely used nickname for the unpopular  Leung, who was elected from 689 votes in the electoral college of 1200 members. Those opposed to Leung claim that he has political leanings toward China’s mainland leadership. Just after his election in 2012, the People’s Daily, the Chinese newspaper, called Leung “comrade,” and later that year, Leung decided to require pro-China patriotic teaching in school, a decision that was eventually vetoed.
At the White House, participants sang protest anthems in Cantonese, including “Under a Vast Sky” and “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from the musical “Les Miserables.” Jeffrey Ngo, one of the rally’s main organizers, pointed to the gathering outside of the White House as a highlight of the event.
“We applied last minute for the permit to gather right outside of the White House, and it was approved. I don’t know if Obama was at home, but if so, I’m sure he heard us,” Ngo said. “I think being able to sing such an important song as a group at that location, legally, is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.”
Ngo hoped that the rally would bring increased attention and a response from the White House to the Hong Kong protests.
“We have gathered over 100,000 signatures to support the petition asking for the White House to respond to the situation in Hong Kong. No other place is more symbolic than outside the White House to sing our song to support democracy in our hometown,” Ngo said.
A sophomore in the MSB*, a protest participant born and raised in Hong Kong, agreed. He said that he hoped the rally would place increased pressure on China from the United States, particularly on Clement Leung, Hong Kong commissioner for economic and trade affairs and the most senior representative from the region to the United States.
“The U.S. really is one of Hong Kong’s largest trading partners and we hold more sway than I think we realize. It is important to get Clement Leung’s attention,” he said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Secretary of State John Kerry at the State Department to discuss the current situation in Hong Kong, stressing China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong, and warning the United States not to interfere in internal affairs.
“Hong Kong’s affairs are China’s affairs. All countries should respect China’s sovereignty,” Wang told multiple news outlets.
Ngo criticized Wang’s declaration.
“China obviously wants to keep foreign countries out of the situation, so that it can continue to exploit Hong Kongers’ rights,” Ngo said. “But I believe the international community, especially the U.K., has the responsibility to ensure that the terms of the Joint Declaration are respected.”
The People’s Republic of China government re-obtained sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997. The Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong guaranteed the territory rights and freedoms, including freedom of the press, of speech, of assembly, of religious belief and of demonstration.
Many of the students leading Hong Kong’s protests are the first generation to grow up with memories of only Chinese rule.
Like Li, many participants at the D.C. event are Hong Kong expatriates. Marco Lam (MSB ’18) attended the rally as an observer concerned for his home in Hong Kong.
“Many friends I know back home are divided over their political affiliations. Some are protesting, others are anti-protest. I came here today to witness the global support for Hong Kong. Above all, I am impressed to see people halfway across the world engaged in this political discourse about Hong Kong,” Lam said.
However, not all the students who participated were from the semi-autonomous region. Lixun Chen (SFS ’16), originally from mainland China, expressed his belief for the necessity of freedom and democracy in Hong Kong.
“As a frequent visitor to Hong Kong, I have always regarded it as a hub of information where I could freely gather information that was censored in China. This preservation of freedom resonates with me on a personal level,” Chen said.
Chen called for increased awareness at the university about the issue.
“I would encourage the Georgetown community to seize the initiative and learn about the history of the Hong Kong people,” he said. “To support the cause, we simply need to make it known to others.”

International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde’s lecture in Gaston Hall on Thursday morning prompted a student protest of her invitation to campus and of the IMF.
In her lecture, Lagarde evaluated the future of the global economy and discussed ideas for resolving international economic problems.
About 10 students, unaffiliated with any student group, used props to play a game of “International Monopoly Fund” to show their opposition to the IMF as the lecture started at 11 a.m.
Students at Smith College protested Lagarde’s invitation to their campus in May, prompting her to drop out as the college’s commencement speaker.
Critics of the IMF charge that the organization has supported oppressive governments in providing aid to developing nations while imposing conditions that favor Western businesses and countries.
“That’s about the wealthy, Western countries that in the case of the IMF, have created really harmful and exploitative situations in other countries around the world that are poorer,” said Suzy Jivotovski (COL ’15), who participated in the protest.
The monopoly game, which protesters performed three times split between Healy Circle and Red Square, positioned protesters as “big business” and pawns as the IMF.
“It was kind of a total satire on the IMF’s lack of transparency, on their very interventionist, loan-shark mentality toward the global economy, toward exports,” Jivotovski said.
In her speech, Lagarde discussed the role of developing countries in the global economy.
“The developing countries have been doing all the heavy lifting in the past five years, contributing to roughly 80 percent of global growth,” Lagarde said. “Led by Asia primarily, particularly China, they will continue to contribute, but at a slightly slower pace because we are all interconnected. If some of the players are injured, the others will be affected too.”
Although these countries are in a period of growth, Lagarde said that the global economy is struggling to come back from financial turmoil.
“The bottom line is that six years after the financial crisis, we continue to see weakness in the global economy,” Lagarde said. “We are still dealing with the legacies of the crisis — much higher debt levels and unemployment are still major difficulties.”
In proposing macroeconomic solutions to these issues, Lagarde pointed to fiscal policy, labor market reform and infrastructural reform.
“Have you heard about growth-friendly, job-friendly, and environmentally friendly fiscal policy? Because so much has already been done in terms of fiscal consolidation, countries have to do so at the right pace — not too fast, not too brutally, and they have to adjust to circumstances,” Lagarde said.
Lagarde also encouraged efficient public spending, reduction of taxes on labor costs and methods to battle tax evasion and said that tackling unemployment is a priority. She criticized current energy subsidies for fossil fuels, which cost $2 trillion in the past year, mostly to the benefit of developed countries.
However, she suggested that there is no definite method to implement labor market reform.
“There is no magic recipe because it has to be country-specific. It has to deal with the particularities of the skillset, the educational system and the kind of growth,” Lagarde said.
Lagarde pushed for policies allowing more women to enter the workforce worldwide, to maximize potential output. Lastly, she advocated for more spending on infrastructure, from providing more Massive Open Online Courses to increase workers’ skillsets to the repair of poorly constructed roads.
Anthony Albanese (COL ’16) found many of Lagarde’s comments to be relatable to domestic issues.
“The idea that increasing women’s participation in the labor force and environmental policies do not significantly decrease growth is a contentious issue domestically,” Albanese said. “That wasn’t something I expected her to say. Especially as a lot of times when speakers talk to students, you hear a lot of vague comments, so it was cool to hear her speak to something so specific.”
Muriel Van de Bilt (SFS ’17) not only appreciated Lagarde’s emphasis on gender inequality in the labor market, but also praised her as a role model.
“Seeing a woman in such a high leadership position in a field that is usually male-dominated makes me realize that she is an example for future generations of female economists,” Van de Bilt said.
The protesters outside Healy Hall said they opposed Lagarde’s lecture because it represented the university’s propensity to present students with a singular perspective.
“The people who put on the action are just a concerned group of students that wanted to create a counterpoint to Christine Lagarde of the IMF speaking at Gaston Hall this morning to represent that we don’t like how the president’s office and administration time and time again invites speakers who talk to students about things that really only have a singular viewpoint,” Jivotovski said.

Protesters, including several Georgetown students, marched through the streets of Foggy Bottom and Georgetown on Saturday, calling for the arrest of police officer Darren Wilson and the demilitarization of the U.S. police force in response to the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August.
The protest coincided with the initial stages of a Metropolitan Police Department program to increase transparency. MPD began equipping police officers with body cameras Oct. 1 to document all actions taken by officers in relation to civilians. The pilot program, which cost the department $1 million, includes 165 MPD officers.
“We are looking at the best practices for implementing these devices,” MPD Chief Cathy Lanier said in a press release. “We are in an age where this type of technology is becoming more common, and we want to capitalize on that. The presence of cameras will benefit the community and MPD members by improving police services, increasing accountability and enhancing public safety.”
Washington, D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray pointed at the events in Ferguson as a catalyst for MPD’s body camera program.
“Especially since the unfortunate incidents in Ferguson, Mo., have brought the issue of body cameras to national attention, I’m proud that MPD will continue to show leadership in this area,” Gray said in a press release.
The D.C. Ferguson march was organized by the National Black United Front, the ANSWER Coalition, Party for Socialism and Liberation, American Muslim Alliance and We Act Radio, a progressive radio station in D.C. Around 250 to 300 people attended the event, including about 20 Georgetown students.
Demonstrators gathered for the march at the Foggy Bottom Metro Station at approximately 7 p.m., after which protesters gradually made their way to Georgetown by way of M Street. The group stopped traffic at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and M Street, and at the corner of 34th Avenue and M Street to talk publicly about the issues surrounding the shooting.
“The idea of the event was that, since people are starting to lose interest and lose focus on the Ferguson issue, which still remains an issue in Ferguson and with police brutality in America, by disrupting traffic and going to the epicenter of privileged Washington in Georgetown, it’s bringing back that this issue is not over, and we’re going to keep fighting for it regardless of whether the rest of the country wants to listen,” said Vincent DeLaurentis (SFS ’17), who attended the march.
Police cars followed the rally through the streets of D.C. to ensure the safety of the protestors and civilians.
“As it relates to marches, the Metropolitan Police Department recognizes individuals’ rights to assemble,” Gwendolyn Crump, director of the MPD Office of Communications, wrote in an email.
Throughout the march, protesters cried, “Shut down police brutality,” accompanied by drumbeats and dancing by the attendees.
“The atmosphere was very inclusive, and onlookers on the sidewalk were encouraged to join, and cars honked all the way from Foggy Bottom to Georgetown,” Carlo Izzo (COL ’17), who participated in the march, said.
Two months after the shooting of Brown, attendees hoped that the march would prevent the incident from fading from the public consciousness.
“I decided to go because I wanted to show how I stand in solidarity with Ferguson and how I am against police brutality, and how I am against racism we’re seeing in police structure. I also wanted to make sure the case of Michael Brown is not only a moment, but a movement,” Patrick Bylis (COL ’17) said.
Attendees also highlighted the lack of accountability for police brutality as a major concern.
“I think the hopes are indicative of the wider Ferguson movement: for people to become aware of how police brutality affects communities of color in America and to take substantive reforms so that brutality isn’t happening, and that when it does happen, there is accountability for the people involved,” DeLaurentis said.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which had advocated for MPD reforms, applauded MPD’s efforts to increase transparency.
“The NAACP supports MPD officers wearing cameras to ensure transparency and accountability of misconduct by both police officers and citizens. These cameras will offer evidence supporting justice for victims of police misconduct and police officers also deserve proof against unjust claims of misconduct,” NAACP D.C. President Akosua Ali said in a statement.
The NAACP has also called for an expanded crisis intervention training program for MPD, changes to the assault on a police officer statute, a requirement that all MPD officers live in the District and an elimination of racial bias in police work.
Despite the improvements, attendees of the rally were hesitant to call the body camera program a triumph, hoping for more sustainable reforms.
“I think that could definitely be a step in the right direction, but I think if they come at it from more of a training perspective, training police officers in terms of privilege and diversity and inclusion, or getting people to be on a commission to investigate crimes that occur between police and civilians, I think coming from that perspective might be a little more sensitive,” Bylis said.
Saturday’s rally was the latest in a series of similar marches in other areas of the city since Brown’s shooting, including through Chinatown, H Street and Adams Morgan, as well as in front of the White House.

Enhanced entry screening for the Ebola virus began at Washington-Dulles International Airport on Thursday, along with four other airports, in an attempt by the Centers for Disease Control to thwart the spread of Ebola into the United States.
University Professor Lawrence Gostin, who specializes in global health law, criticized the efficacy of the screenings on Minnesota Public Radio on Oct. 8. Gostin also directs the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law and was the Founding O’Neill Chair in Global Health Law.
“I think that what the CDC has done for airport screening is reasonable and the most moderate they could have done. It’s well targeted, and I think it’s a very measured response,” Gostin told The Hoya. “But will it work? Probably not.”
Ebola screenings began at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport Saturday, and Chicago’s O’Hare International, Newark Liberty International and Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International joined them Thursday.
There have been eight cases of Ebola in the United States. Thomas Eric Duncan, the first reported Ebola patient in the United States, left Liberia on Sept. 19 on a Brussels Airline jet to Belgium. From there, he flew to Dulles International, and spent three hours there on a layover, before flying into Dallas. Duncan died Oct. 8.
“We work to continuously increase the safety of Americans,” CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a press release last Wednesday. “We believe these new measures will further protect the health of Americans, understanding that nothing we can do will get us to absolute zero risk until we end the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.”
These five airports account for over 94 percent of travellers from the Ebola-impacted countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Travellers from the affected countries will be taken aside to a separate screening area, where trained staff from Customs and Border Patrol will check them for signs of sickness.
These travellers will also be questioned about any potential exposure to the virus, and any indication of Ebola-like symptoms or possible encounters with the disease will result in transfer to a quarantined area for further evaluation.
Gostin cited the historical failings of fever monitoring, particularly during the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, outbreak of 2002 to 2003, as precedent for the failure of screenings. The SARS outbreak started in southern China and spread to infect individuals in 37 other countries, including the United States. Hundreds of thousands of travellers were monitored and not a single SARS case was found.
He said that it is possible that symptoms resembling Ebola may result in false positives, wasting resources that could otherwise be used to combat the real threat.
“I’m afraid that this will distract a lot of resources and attention from the real problem,” Gostin said. “This could burden the CDC, as well as state and local health departments and emergency rooms.”
John Kraemer (LAW ’08), professor of health systems administration at Georgetown and a Scholar at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law, was also skeptical of airport screening.
“That sort of assessment will not catch every potential case. People will still be asymptomatic and in the incubation period at the time they go through screening,” he said.
In addition to screenings, House Republicans also called for a travel ban from West Africa in an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on Ebola Thursday.
Gostin vigorously disagreed with a travel ban, arguing that it would prevent aid from reaching the affected countries.
“I think a travel ban would make us much more at risk. What it would do is exacerbate the epidemic in West Africa, and the more that that epidemic rages out of control, the more risk there is of international spread,” Gostin said.
Kraemer, who also opposed a travel ban, admitted that despite its potential inefficacies, airport screening was one of the best available options.
“A travel ban would be highly counterproductive, and something like biologic screening would be logistically very difficult,” he said. “Airport screening is essentially the best option available under the circumstances.”
Instead of focusing on prevention within the United States, Gostin said that it is essential that the government increase the scope of its response in West Africa, which he criticized as inadequate.
“The surest way to prevent cases in the United States is to root out infection at the source,” he said. “It’s been a very flawed and failed effort in West Africa.”
Kraemer echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the far more serious epidemic in Africa.
“Everybody should be allocating significantly more resources to control the outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea,” he said. “In the United States, Ebola may kill a very small number of people. It is quickly becoming catastrophic in those countries.”
The much-publicized death of Thomas Eric Duncan at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas, as well as the failure of the hospital to ensure the safety of staff and other patients, has led many to criticize the United States’ ability to handle Ebola. Most hospitals are ill-equipped for controlling the disease and are susceptible to breaches in protocol.
“Dallas exposed a soft underbelly of American vulnerability in our health system,” Gostin said. “We’ve cut our funding for the CDC, we’ve cut our funding for state and local health departments and we have enormous deficiency in our response capabilities.”
Despite this seemingly grim outlook, Kraemer said that Ebola does not pose a significant threat to the United States.
“The likelihood of significant community transmission is very small,” Kraemer said. “You don’t see significant outbreaks of Ebola anyplace that has a functioning health care system.”

The Washington, D.C., Department of Health is working to designate MedStar Georgetown University Hospital as an international center of excellence as part of a program to help promote the District as a premier medical destination and attract foreigners to undergo medical procedures, participate in research and train with D.C.’s medical providers.
The program, in development for the past year, will announce specific projects later in the month that will begin in January 2015. The Children’s National Health System was also chosen for this designation.
Medical tourism is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as “travelling to another country for medical care,” and 750,000 residents of the United States travel abroad every year to undergo medical treatments.
D.C. DOH Director Joxel Garcia expressed interest in attracting international travelers to D.C. for medical care through packages that include medical procedures in addition to tourist attractions.
“What we are doing is very unique,” Garcia said. “We are going to create tourism packages to promote medical procedures. For example, a package can include the medical treatment or procedure as well as a visit to Congress or the White House.”
Garcia expects the program to be effective in attracting visitors to D.C., aiming for 7,000 visitors through the program in the first year and 10,000 in the second.
To ensure the program would play to the unique strengths of the hospitals in the District, Garcia conducted extensive conversations with D.C. medical institutions while building the program.
“The program will promote consortia between all of the hospitals in the District, working together to promote excellence in health care here in the District at the international level. Each institution will be able to offer expertise in the areas they choose,” Garcia said. “This program will amplify what each of those health care providers already do.”
With three airports in the D.C. area allowing for easy accessibility to the region, Garcia added that integrating D.C.’s strengths would bring more tourism to the district.
“We already have one of the strongest health care systems in America. We have great hotels, great hospitality and great transportation systems,” he said. “We are offering a framework that allows many great parts of D.C. to work together. I think that this will be a very good offering that will be very easy to sell.”
The medical tourism program will contribute to a White House initiative aiming to increase the number of visitors to the United States each year to 100 million by 2021 in order to create tens of thousands of new jobs in tourism in the United States and boost the national economy. Two million people visited the District last year from abroad.
“Encouraging more visitors to come to the United States to stay in our hotels, eat in our restaurants, shop in our stores and explore this great country, will deliver a much needed economic boost while strengthening U.S. relations around the world,” Stephen Cloobeck, Chairman of Brand USA, a tourism promotion organization partnered with the White House on the initiative, said in a press release.
Garcia said that the influx of international patients into D.C. hospitals would not diminish the medical care of D.C. residents, explaining that for medical research institutions like Georgetown University in particular, the benefits of international exchange could bolster the medical care offered by the District.
“Having Georgetown, Johns Hopkins and [The George Washington University] here gives us a powerful platform to attract research,” he said. “Having more treatment, research and academia would make this a great opportunity for the District and make Georgetown University much stronger, although it is already very renowned.”
The Medstar Georgetown University Hospital will showcase its specialties in organ transplants and oncology as an international center of excellence in the medical tourism program. Nicole Duncan, assistant vice president of advocacy and international services at the Medstar Georgetown University Hospital, said that the hospital is committed to treating both international and domestic patients.
“Typically the process with our international patients is very planned. We know when they are flying here so we can have appointments scheduled for them. This in no way infringes on patients in the emergency room or in the clinic,” Duncan said.
While the hospital has seen a large number of severe cases in international patients from Middle Eastern countries, Japan, China and South America, Duncan noted that partnering with the DOH and other hospitals might allow the hospital to also attract international patients with more acute cases.
“Because we provide care to treat very complex diseases and illnesses, partnering with the District could be extremely helpful,” she said. “[Through] Dr. Garcia’s vision to expand the program beyond international patients who need immediate care to some of the less acute services, we would probably see an increase in the number of international patients.”

North Korean defector Yeonmi Park spoke about her experience fleeing her home country in Gaston Hall on Sunday in an event hosted by student group Truth and Human Rights in North Korea.
Park spoke about her life in North Korea as well as her defection, which took her to China and later to South Korea. Growing up, she was without many of the things Westerners take for granted, but her living situation was not yet dire.
“There was no Internet, but I was not starving,” Park said.
Park said her life changed after her father was arrested for illegal trading. In the wake of the arrest, Park’s mother was interrogated by the government for two years.
These experiences led Park to defect when she was 13 with the help of smugglers, and with the help of the embassy in China, she entered university life. Park said that after defecting, she identified as a South Korean, not wanting to reveal her past.
“I was so careful about my identity,” Park said.
Park was separated from her sister, who also defected, for seven years, and now that they have reunited, she said her goal is to help her sister adjust to life outside of North Korea.
“So now I am trying to tell her she is not the victim and she fought for her freedom and her life” Park said.
Park has become a media personality, and has said she hopes to share her story with as many people as she can.
“I decided to speak out and it became my kind of job,” Park said. “If I speak out, people will listen to me.”
The floor was later opened for a question-and-answer period in which guests asked Park about a range of topics, including what it was like to experience Western culture for the first time.
Halle Hagan (SFS ’18) said the program offered a chance to hear a firsthand account of what it was like to live in a communist nation.
“I have always been interested in North Korea and other communist regimes, particularly because North Korea is one of the last couple that we have as modern day communist regimes and it was really fascinating to hear Yeonmi’s speech,” Hagan said. “I thought that she was really an inspiration,w especially as a young person for us to look up to as an example of someone who has used her experiences to do good and promote certain ideas throughout the world.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Park defected at age 23. She was 13.

November 19, 2014 at 4:52 pm
Thanks for the Hoya article, Sarah!
Just a small factual error… she is currently younger than 23 years old, so she couldn’t possibly have escaped when she was 23. The actual age was 13 when she left.

Around 500 protestors gathered outside of the White House late Monday night, demonstrating against a grand jury decision to not indict Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson. Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in August.

Protests broke out in Ferguson and across the nation Monday night. In Washington, D.C., protesters convened on U Street and marched to the White House. Among the protesters were students from Georgetown, Howard University and other D.C. colleges.
Protesters chanted slogans such as “Hands up, don’t shoot,” “Black lives matter” and “Black power.”
“We have to have a sense of accountability. If you shoot a kid with his hands up for allegedly stealing Cigarillos, you deserve to be in trouble for it,” Tarik Endale (NHS ’16), who attended the demonstrations at the White House, said. “That’s kind of how the justice system works, but apparently it doesn’t apply to the people who are supposed to be enforcing it.”
At midnight, the protesters left the White House and marched toward Chinatown. Demonstrations are planned for every day this week, including a protest at Mount Vernon Square on Tuesday at 7 p.m. and a protest at Union Station early Wednesday.

Hey Tarik, why don’t you drop out of Georgetown and go to the police academy and see what a difficult job it is to be a cop and put your life in the line everyday. Georgetown can fill your spot with an intelligent and insightful person.

In other words, why is the Hoya using the word “Verdict” in the headline.   It means that Officer Wilson was indicted, tried in a criminal court, and found not guilty by a jury.  That is mis-educating the public on this sensitive and sometimes technical story.

The Hoya’s reporting suggests that Michael Brown’s hands were “up” when he was shot and that he was shot “for stealing cigarillos” (rather than for allegedly attacking an officer).  Please provide your source on that important point.  The Hoya did not report that MB allegedly “charged” the officer like a “bull”, allegedly attacked him in his car, etc.  Why?

There is nothing written in the US constituion guaranteeing a “civil right” for young black males to steal, assault and disobey law enforcement. The only civil rights that were violated were those of Officer Wilson. This man’s life is now in shambles because he did his job. He can no longer work as a public servant, nor can he even show his face in public. Officer Wilson is portrayed as the bad guy, while the family of Michael Brown is shown on national TV encouraging destruction of the community with no public reprimand. 
The most disturbing and sad aspect of the whole situation is the ignorance of not just the black activists, but also the white liberals. Justice was served long before the grand jury made a decision. Michael Brown made the decision, not the grand jury. His parents should be outraged because their son was not the “gentle giant” they thought he was. Unfortunately, situations like this will surely happen again. It was a tragedy that a young man lost his life, but the real tragedy is the lack of common sense, morality and indivual accountability in the black community. The law was followed and a decision was made. Deal with it, move one and rise up against the thugs who are destroying our way of life, not those who are fighting to protect it. 
As for the protestors across the USA, where is the line drawn between making a point and causing criminal acts? Blocking highways and intersections to protest civil right violations causes gridlock, inconvenience and anger. Protesters are violating the rights of those who wish to travel freely. How is this acceptable? How does inconveniencing the general public help your cause? The level of ignorance surrounding this entire matter from day one is sickening and unbelievable. Protests such as those that we’ve seen are pointless and will only serve to work against those trying to affect change. 
Protesting will not solve the problem. We need parents to teach respect, morals and values to our children. We must teach our children to do the right thing, not to find fault with what is wrong. This is only a matter of race because black activists make it so. What if it had been a black officer and a white victim? What if it were an Asian or a Hispanic? Does it really matter? A crime was committed and a police officer who was sworn to protect and serve the community did his job. There is a system in place to ensure justice. The system worked. And now, for those who choose to use this as reason to cause violence and destruction, you too will find out how the justice system works when you are arrested and removed from society.

Michael Brown robbed a local Ferguson convenience store shortly before his death. Then Brown smashed police officer Darren Wilson in the face and wrestled the officer for his gun before he was shot dead. At least seven black Ferguson witnesses corroborated Officer Darren Wilson’s story. Officer Darren Wilson was not indicted by the St. Louis County grand jury after an extensive investigation. But facts be damned.

Protests erupted across the nation and around Washington, D.C., following St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch’s announcement Monday night that Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson would not be indicted in the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.
D.C. protesters dissatisfied with the decision rallied in front of the White House on Monday night and organized further demonstrations on Tuesday, including a silent protest on Georgetown’s campus. Students and professors at the university expressed discontent with the ruling, having held multiple reflections throughout the semester to discuss the unfolding events in Ferguson.
On Monday night, hundreds of D.C. protesters responded to the grand jury’s decision with a march from U Street to the White House. Among the protestors were numerous students from Georgetown, some of whom marched down Pennsylvania Avenue chanting, “Hands up, don’t shoot.”
“I’m a strong advocate for justice, and showing that all lives matter and black lives matter,” said Kattlyn Carpenter, a freshman at Howard University who attended the rally at the White House. “This isn’t just a hashtag or a moment. We’re really going to stand for it.”
Protesters began marching to the White House shortly after the 9:20 p.m. announcement of the decision, concurrent with President Barack Obama speaking on national television to urge protesters to remain peaceful. By 11 p.m., a large crowd had convened but remained peaceful.
For some protesters, the demonstration served as an emotional outlet following the grand jury’s widely awaited decision.
“I heard that a group of students was coming down here to convey a very deep sense of despair at the lack of an indictment of Darren Wilson,” Chris Wager (COL ’17) said. “I’m honestly just really pissed off and needed to channel that energy and needed to support the community.”
Around 500 demonstrators gathered outside the White House for over an hour, chanting slogans such as “Black lives matter” and singing hymns. The protesters left at midnight and marched through Chinatown, closing many roads and intersections.
“We want to make a point that black lives do matter and that it’s not OK to kill. Justice should be served for Mike Brown and for Trayvon Martin and for all the lives that were lost unjustly,” Howard freshman Ngodoo Iye said.
Protests in D.C. continued on Tuesday with demonstrations at the Metropolitan Police Department headquarters, the Office of Police Complaints, the D.C. Council and Mayor-elect Muriel Bowser’s transitional office.
At 7 p.m. on Tuesday, thousands of protesters convened at Mount Vernon Square for an even larger rally than the night before. The demonstrators marched through Chinatown and ended their protest at around 9:30 p.m. at the American Art Museum.
Protesters chanted slogans including “No justice, no peace” and “Don’t shoot” as they marched, and many carried signs condemning racism and police brutality. At several times during the march, protesters also yelled, “F—k the police,” in response to the MPD officers who were keeping watch on the rally.
“We just want to see black people get justice and be spoken up for. They deserve to have rights, and black lives do actually matter,” said Emonte Wimbush, a member of Black United Students at Kent State University, who participated in the march.

While many D.C. Ferguson protests incorporated mass chanting, a demonstration at Georgetown chose silence.
Dozens of students gathered in Red Square on Tuesday at 12:28 p.m. for a silent demonstration, which was organized by Georgetown’s Black Leadership Forum and lasted less than 10 minutes.
Demonstrators stood in silence with their hands raised for nearly five minutes. After the silent demonstration, some participants sang a brief song before the group disbanded.
In the weeks following Brown’s death on Aug. 9, both peaceful and violent protests broke out in the St. Louis suburb, eliciting increasingly aggressive police enforcement tactics. The mounting tensions quickly garnered national attention, and spotlighted race relations. Just days after Brown’s death, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a civil rights investigation of the shooting. The investigation is ongoing.
The university community addressed the conflict through several events. At the start of the semester, students led a vigil in Red Square on Aug. 26, while Provost Robert Groves and several university professors held a panel discussion in Gaston Hall on Aug. 28. The Black Leadership Forum and the Center for Social Justice also co-hosted a “Ferguson Teach-In” on Sept. 17, featuring roundtable discussions, panels and student presentations. Students from the Georgetown chapter of NAACP, Black Student Alliance, Program on Justice and Peace, Patrick Healy Fellowship, Georgetown Solidarity Committee and United Feminists traveled to Ferguson as part of the “Weekend of Resistance” in October, in a trip sponsored by the Center for Social Justice and the Office of Affirmative Action Programs.
GU NAACP President Mikaela Ferrill (COL ’15) voiced her disappointment in the grand jury’s decision and said that she thought it was indicative of an ongoing trend in America.
“I am sad, angry, and upset with the grand jury’s decision. Time and time again, America proves that it does not value the lives of black men and women,” she said.
Crystal Walker (SFS ’16), who travelled to Ferguson in October to participate in the “Weekend of Resistance” along with Ferrill and 15 other Georgetown students, said that she was not surprised by the decision.
“It’s a shame that our judicial system failed to address and confront such a pressing issue and problem in this so-called great country,” Walker said.
LaDarius Torrey (COL ’17), who also made the trip to Ferguson, said that he felt a mix of emotions upon hearing about the grand jury’s decision. Torrey said that while he is upset about the decision, he also fears for the future.
“I’m angry, actually beyond pissed, on one hand, and completely frightened and left hopeless on the other,” Torrey wrote in an email. “The case of Michael Brown is not an isolated incident, it’s a recurring theme in ‘our’ nation.”
Torrey co-produced a video called “Am I Next?” in September as a response to Brown’s death. The video, which depicted a group of young men standing on the steps of Healy Hall while Walter Kelly (COL ’16) delivered a spoken word poem, aimed to highlight misconceptions about young black men.
“Many call this a race war, but how is this so? There is no level playing field or battleground,” Torrey wrote. “The system has been structured to work against us, and the police, who are supposed to be held accountable to protect us all, are the main perpetrators of injustice in America.”
Members of the Georgetown community voiced their reactions to the grand jury’s decision on social media. Sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson and history professor Marcia Chatelain took to Twitter to express their discontent.
“This is a profound miscarriage of justice and a slap in the face of all citizens who cherish democracy,” Dyson wrote. “We must continue to fight this injustice.”
Chatelain urged other professors to incorporate the events into their classes.
“And so we start again…consider teaching ‘The Making of Ferguson’ … tomorrow,” Chatelain tweeted, providing a link to a Dissent Magazine article with the same name and using the hashtag #FergusonSyllabus.
Ferrill said she is not discouraged by the jury’s decision, but rather will use it as motivation in what she said is a fight for social justice. She added that the Georgetown community should also take a closer look at diversity in education.
“I challenge the entire Georgetown community, students, faculty, and staff to take this as an opportunity to think critically about what happened in Ferguson and what happens in various communities everyday,” Ferrill said. “It is upsetting to see students not using their privilege to cause social change.”

“Demonstrators stood in silence with their hands raised.” Has it not yet filtered through to the campus that the forensic evidence and testimony of black eyewitnesses show that Mike Brown’s hands were not raised as he charged the policeman? Meantime, it is to GU students’ credit that their protest was silent.

On Monday night, after the release of the grand jury verdict rejecting indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the Ferguson, Missouri shooting of 18-year-old black man Michael Brown, President Obama took to the microphones. “We need to recognize that this is not just an issue for Ferguson, this is an issue for America,” he said. “[T]here are still problems and communities of color aren’t just making these problems up.”
Obama was wrong, at least in the case of Darren Wilson. In viewing thousands of pages of FBI interviews and grand jury testimony, it becomes eminently clear that many members of the local community did make up the story about Michael Brown being executed by Wilson – and pressured others to lie to police or keep silent.
According to the St. Louis County Police Investigative Report, the mob mentality took root almost immediately after the shooting. By the time detectives arrived at the scene of the incident, there was “a large crowd of bystanders and a large uniformed police presence at the scene when detectives arrived.” That crowd included both Brown’s mother and his stepfather, according to witness testimony. The police report states, “Many individuals were clearly upset and were expressing their frustration, by at times yelling obscenities and threats, and attempting to encroach on the crime scene itself.”
It got worse:
As the scene investigation continued, there were several large groups of hostile individuals around the perimeter of the crime scene. The investigation of the scene was interrupted several times by death threats directed toward police officers and gunshots being fired by an unknown persons around the crime scene.
According to the police report, a bevy of witnesses described intimidation from the local community, as well as falsification of testimony. One witness initially told police she didn’t want to “get involved for fear of retaliation.” She said, “I don’t know these people. I have to live here.”
Another female witness told police, “I don’t know nothin’.”
An adult male near the scene “commented to detectives as they walked by that he witnessed the incident and the officer was ‘in the right’ and ‘did what he had to do.’ He added the statements being made by bystanders in the complex were inaccurate. The detectives momentarily stopped to speak with the male who was clearly uncomfortable speaking with detectives. The male indicated he was not making any further comments or identifying himself.”
Two more witnesses, one male and one female, “said they were afraid to speak about what they witnessed. Both said they were worried about retaliation from people who live in the area.” One “began crying and said she could not talk about it.” The male said that he saw Brown inside the vehicle. He turned away, and when he turned back, “the male began moving quickly toward the officer and he heard several more gunshots.” Both witnesses refused to provide recorded statements.
One witness told police that “she had been speaking to her neighbors about the incident, and her neighbors were getting upset at what they believed happened. Their beliefs were inconsistent with what she witnessed.”
Yet the witness told police “that although present during the incident, and seeing the entirety of what happened, he would not be speaking to police for fear of retaliation from neighborhood residents. He also stated the information being broadcast by the news outlets was not accurate information and there were ‘blatant lies from those giving accounts of what they saw.’ He said there were multiple people present when the shooting occurred and even those people, when interviewed by the media, were giving false statements.”
Still another witness told police he had “already told investigators from Saint Louis County Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he was not willing to formally discussed the incident, but he was willing to discuss his fears.” He said “threats… had been made to the residents of Canfield Green Apartment Complex. He said notes had been posted on various apartment buildings threatening people not to talk to the police, and gunshots were still being fired every night.” He said “there were at least 10 other people who were outside and saw exactly what happened. He was not willing to provide names of any of those individuals.” He said Wilson told Brown “no less than 10 times to get down” while they were both on the street. He said Brown never had hands raised.
In FBI interviews, witnesses repeated such accusations. Witness 10, whose account backed Wilson’s story, said, “I just wanted to come forward and just tell it how I seen it. Because I feel like it’s very rare that somebody’s gonna come forward and tell actually what happened.” Witness 14, who initially said Brown was shot from behind before changing his story to accord with the facts, stated:
You have to understand the mentality of some of these young guys they have nothing to do. When they can latch on the something they embellish it because they want something to do. This is something they giving the okay now we got something we can get into… The majority of them do not work. They all they do is sit around and get high all day… two people never seen these people before in my life in the whole time I have been out there and I sit out there a lot. Came up threatenin’, hey y’all better not say nothing, ah, you’ll snitching and all.
Witness 14 added that within one minute of the shooting, there were 70 or 80 people “saying things that didn’t happen,” and they “started embellishing it when the stepfather showed up.” They lied, he said, when they said the officer “ran up behind him shot him in the back.” They lied, he said, when they said he had “his hands straight up in the air.” They lied, he said, when they stated that Brown was shot while down. “They had it in they mindset of what happened,” he continued. “They are set they are looking for a reason to explode, that’s what they, ‘cause they don’t have anything to do… They got nothing else to do they running all day they’re drinking and-and getting high all day we see this all the time.”
And indeed, witness testimony showed that witnesses routinely embellished their accounts, changed them to fit autopsy results as those results broke in the media, and even lied about seeing the events at all.
After Dorian Johnson, Brown’s alleged accomplice in robbing a local convenience store, went on television and told his false story about Brown having been shot from behind and raising his hands before being killed, witnesses began shifting their own testimony to match. Multiple witnesses said they knew Johnson, and one said she had spoken with him before talking to the FBI. Two witnesses brought handwritten notes to police matching in wording and other respects.
At least 12 witnesses claimed that Brown was shot from behind, which was factually false. At least 16 witnesses said Brown’s hands were up when he was shot, which was factually false. One witness said Wilson used a Taser, then a gun: false. Another said she witnessed the events, but admitted she was blocks away when the events occurred. Still another witness said there were two officers involved in the shooting, and admitted she couldn’t tell what she’d seen and what she’d read about the case. One witness admitted in testimony to changing his story to “coincide with what really happened.” Another witness said that he was friends with Brown, and that Brown was shot while on his knees. When informed that such a story contradicted all physical evidence, the man admitted that he had not seen the shooting and then asked if he could leave because he was “uncomfortable.”
The looting and rioting and protesting are all secondary to the astroturfed case against Officer Darren Wilson in the first place. At least in Ferguson, one “community of color” did make this problem up. The media went along with it, ignoring the intimidation and the witness’ lying. And an innocent man, by all available physical evidence and a vast majority of the reliable witness testimony, could have gone to prison or death row because of it.

Professor Daniel Nexon discussed the link between various forms of popular culture and politics in “The Hunger Games” trilogy Wednesday afternoon at the Mortara Center.
Nexon began his talk by examining the historical instances in which entertainment meshed with government. He said that popular films and books have shaped the political discussion for large audiences, and he gave examples such as the connection of “Star Trek” to NASA as well as the link between popular television show “24” and enhanced interrogation techniques used against suspected terrorists.
“There’s long been a general interest, I think, in the relationship between popular culture and politics,” Nexon said. “Exposure to certain ideas in popular culture might then condition our understanding and ethics about the way the world works.”
Nexon said that the most powerful genre for these sorts of connections is science fiction.
“In science fiction there is a tremendous emphasis on constructing worlds and giving them truthiness or verisimilitude,” he said.“They pretend to be real and therefore they have to work out their own rules, their own logic.”
Nexon then turned from the history of how popular culture influenced politics to what he said is a current example, “The Hunger Games” by Suzanne Collins. According to Nexon, because the influence of “The Hunger Games” has extended to real-world politics, it cannot be classified simply as an interesting story
“People are using the solidarity gesture [from]‘The Hunger Games’ as a way of expressing their political aspirations,” he said.“We see some really interesting examples of this in the Thai protest and Hong Kong protest.”
The politics of the tyrannical Panem, the fictional setting of “The Hunger Games,” have many parallels to the real world and follow similar patterns of current regimes that restrict free speech, according to Nexon. Specifically, Nexon likened Panem to the People’s Republic of China, a country infamous for violations of human rights.
“This is a very classic imperial strategy and it works in empires the same way that it works in Panem,” Nexon said. “When you keep [people] isolated, when you don’t give them very significant glimpses into one another’s lives and you don’t let them communicate with one another, it makes it very easy to contain unrest.”
“The Hunger Games” also provides a good representation of historical trauma and the difficulty it takes countries to move past it, according to Nexon. Prior to the timeline in the movies and books, Panem was torn apart during a period known as the Dark Days. They had a lasting effect that continued to dog society when “The Hunger Games” begins.
“Panem is trapped in re-inflicting the same trauma over and over and over again and picking at the wound,” Nexon said. “How does it do that? It does it through the Hunger Games.”
Nexon said he saw the theme of politics of trauma as being representative of the human condition in general. He examined a scene in “The Hunger Games”in which the protagonist is forced to explain to children that they are standing on the graves of other citizens from District 12. Nexon said he found this scene particularly moving.
“We all play and operate on the graveyards of the past and on the graveyards of past atrocities,” Nexon said.“Like Panem, we need to figure out for ourselves how we reconcile to that fact.”
Nexon also discussed the link between “The Hunger Games” and the popularity of reality television shows. He said that they are similar because in both, entertainment comes from laughing at or making fun of the suffering of others.
“The broader issue of course is one about voyeurism, particularly the voyeurism of pain and suffering,” Nexon said.“The way that a lot of reality television shows work [is] by essentially putting us in the position of voyeurs.”
Nexon was introduced by Director of the Mortara Center for International Studies Kathleen McNamara, who said that symbols can play an important part in political messages. She said that the use of symbolism from the “The Hunger Games” in real life political movements shows a connection between the book and current issues some countries face daily.
“The point is that the symbols are actually doing potentially a lot of work in rearranging political coalitions,” McNamara said. “[They’re] reshaping the way that people think about their preferences and the potential possibilities of politics.”
Zachary Burdette (SFS ’17), who attended the event, said he did not see the parallel between media and “The Hunger Games” as unique.
“I think in a sense that a lot of people get a masochistic voyeurism from a lot of different things in life,” he said.“Being aware that there are systems of oppression that you aren’t actively challenging has the same kind of effect.”
Jesse Reiff (SFS ’17) said he has renewed interest in the movie after hearing Nexon explain its relationship to politics.
“I want to rewatch ‘Hunger Games’ to reexamine the themes discussed,” Reiff said.

More than 75 members of the Georgetown community listened to harrowing testimony from three North Korean defectors at a panel hosted by the Truth and Human Rights in North Korea club Wednesday evening in the Healey Family Student Center.
Praise Ju, Hyeonah Ji and Johan Kim, speaking mostly through a Korean interpreter, talked about their former lives in North Korea as well as their escapes and advocacy work after defecting.
“We want to highlight the forced repatriation policy of the Chinese government and also to stop the genocide that is occurring in North Korea,” Kim said. “To talk about those two main issues, that is why we’re here visiting the U.S.”
Ju, born in 1991, said she was a part of the new generation of North Koreans named the “Market Generation” because of its heavy usage of illegal black markets.
One day in 1998, Ju’s father brought home an illegal radio, giving Ju and her family access to outside information for the first time. Before long the Ju family began to see falsehood in the nationalistic rhetoric from the government, according to Ju.
Ju’s father was the first from her family to escape, followed by her mother in 2008. Ju stayed for another three years, all the while illegally watching South Korean and American TV shows and movies such as James Bond under the blankets or behind closed curtains.
“It was dangerous, but we couldn’t stop,” Ju said of her illegal TV watching.
Ji, a writer and reporter living in South Korea, escaped North Korea four times and was repatriated by the Chinese three times. During her repatriation she said she suffered numerous offenses at the hands of the North Korean government, such as a forced abortion and a year in a prison camp for escaping the country.
Plans of escape began forming after Ji’s father travelled to China to meet a relative and heard a South Korean broadcast, which opened his eyes to numerous discrepancies in North Korean rhetoric. Ji, however, expressed hesitation because she thought escape might soil plans she had to become a writer. Eventually, want of freedom convinced Ji to attempt escape.
“I had this longing to experience and to live life in freedom and enjoy human rights in a free and democratic country,” Ji said. “So that’s what motivated me to escape North Korea.”
Ji’s father escaped in 1998, but has not been heard from since. Until 2007, Ji said she went through tremendous suffering in attempts to escape, including being sold into a human trafficking ring along with her family.
Another hardship was Ji’s imprisonment. Ji said that there were 2,000 prisoners in Prison Facility 11 when she arrived, but only 200 survived.
“The only reason why I came out alive from that prison experience was that no matter what it took, I vowed that I would come out and tell the world about what I saw, what I experienced,” Ji said.
Ji’s full story is told in her book, “A Thousand Miles For Freedom,” which is currently only available in Korean.
Kim, a former North Korean singer, said he was forced to go in the fields six times a day, despite no pay and near-death starvation, to sing songs praising Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung.
“Because there was nothing to eat, we ended up eating grass or peeling or taking or scraping whatever we could find and get our hands on to salvage those material, those goods at the lowest cost possible,” Kim said.
Eventually Kim was arrested while salvaging metal from a power station.
“After I was arrested the first words said to me by the North Korean agent were, ‘It’s all over for you. You’re good as dead now,’” Kim said.
Kim was then taken to a North Korean prison and was placed in a barren cell. Kim, finding a small, loose piece of metal, said he used the piece of scrap for 14 hours to scrape his way out of his prison cell and escaped to China.
In China, Kim found refuge in a church where he said he began to see the falsity of North Korea’s teachings.
“When I realized all the lies that had been told to me, I realized that [North Korea] was a complete lie, and I felt such betrayal,” Kim said.
Kim now works as a producer for the Far East Broadcasting Company in South Korea, where he helps underground Christians in North Korea by airing Christian broadcasts across the border.
After a brief question-and-answer period, in which the question of China’s implication in the refugee situation was discussed, Kim closed out the panel with a performance of a song illustrating the division in the Korean Peninsula.
Shaquille James (COL ’16), co-president of THiNK, said that the event was well-received by the audience.
“I think it went over very, very well,” James said. “Usually when we’re planning these things you really have no idea what the defectors are going to say, and after [Wednesday], I realized I have no idea what they’re actually going to do either.”
Lynn Lee (SFS ’18), a member of THiNK’s political committee, said she thought the event was eye-opening for many who may not know the extent of events in Korea.
“I think this kind of event is really, really important because I see a lot of people outside the Korean peninsula, they don’t know what’s going on in North Korea,” Kim said. “They are willing to be involved, but they don’t know how to be involved and what’s going on.”

Lauinger Library opened a new exhibit last week on its third floor honoring the Jesuit heritage of Georgetown University.
The exhibit, titled “The Woodstock Theological Library: The Jesuit Heritage of Georgetown University,” is located in both the Kerbs Gallery, which is on the third floor of the library between the Circulation and Reference Desks, and the Woodstock Theological Library on the Lower Level.
The Kerbs Gallery exhibit focuses on the history of the Woodstock Theological Library, beginning from its founding in 1869 as part of the Woodstock College, which was a Maryland Jesuit seminary from 1869 to 1974, to the present-day.
Amy E. Phillips, the Woodstock Theological Library Rare Materials Cataloger, was one of the main organizers of the exhibit.
“The exhibit is a look at the early founding of the Jesuit Maryland province,” Phillips said. “The Jesuits were educated at Woodstock College, which was founded in 1869. I took some images from the resources that were used in the founding, such as a map of the farm they bought that would become the college – I showed the first librarian of the Woodstock Library – and also some of the scholarship that was produced out of Woodstock.”
Phillips said the preserved scholarship, particularly the Woodstock Letters, revealed a significant amount about the workings of the Jesuits around the world. The letters detail the Jesuit history and expansion from the late 1800s on.
“The Woodstock letters began as correspondence between the Jesuits about what they were doing,” Phillips said. “Then, as they expanded their missions in China, Japan and Latin America, [the letters] became more extensive. As a result, it is a look into what Jesuits from the United States were doing in the world, and also takes on certain intellectual character by documenting some of the theological discussions that they were having and researching.”
The exhibit on the Lower Level of Lauinger focuses on a different aspect of Jesuit heritage, namely the role of Mary as an icon and symbol in Jesuit tradition. The display takes inspiration from a similar exhibit titled “Picturing Mary: Women, Mother, Idea,” currently on display at the National Museum of Women in the Arts.
Woodstock Theological Library Director J. Leon Hooper, S.J., was encouraged to put together the display to portray the important role Mary has for Jesuits.
“The collections aim to point out the link between devotion to Mary and how it carried over into the theological considerations, especially in the 19th century debates about the innocence of Mary and the Immaculate Conception, as well as to demonstrate how central the image of Mary is,” Hooper said.
The display includes various depictions of Mary, scholastic arguments, images and documents dealing with Jesuits and the debate regarding the Immaculate Conception. The exhibit also includes the first printed edition of Saint Ignatius’ “Spiritual Exercises,” printed in 1548.
Hooper said the exhibit carries a special relevance to the Jesuit founder, St. Ignatius of Loyola, whose work inspired the founders of Georgetown University.
“Ignatius was a soldier and knight, whose injury by cannon ball caused him to read about lives of the saints and gospels,” Hooper said. “He hardly missed a beat from being a knight for a secular ruler to being a knight for Christ, and Mary is very central in all of that. The Spiritual Exercises are meditations and exercises, in which the central image is Christ the king calling him [Ignatius] to serve in trying to win back the world for God. Every one of the exercises has prayer to Mary that this will be fulfilled.”
The exhibits opened at a key moment, a few days after Jesuit Heritage week, which took place at the end of January and celebrated the Jesuit history of Georgetown.
Associate Professor Fr. William C. McFadden, S.J., said the exhibit plays an important role in educating viewers on the history and foundations of the university.
“The exhibit is part of a celebration of history,” McFadden said. “At a university, a library is special in that it captures in some sort of record way the history. You’d certainly want libraries to be a central aspect in any kind of celebration of that sort.”
Phillips said the exhibit will help celebrate the unique roots of the university.
“It is important to know our foundations and our particular unique Jesuit character,” Phillips said. “The life of the Jesuits, which was always about the whole person and pioneering work in both spiritual psychological growth and formation, as well as very rigorous academic training .”
Lydia Bubniak (SFS ’18) viewed the exhibit and said that it is an excellent way to keep students cognizant of Georgetown’s Jesuit roots.
“Georgetown was founded on the idea of caring for the whole person,” Bubniak said. “Reminding students of the original Jesuit ideals will result long-term in a more caring student body and alumni who seek to use their knowledge to change the world in a positive way.”
Gina Kim (SFS ’18) looked at the exhibit and said she saw the importance of embracing the identity of Georgetown University.
“Talking to my older friends, something they have cited as important is the emphasis Georgetown puts on the care for the whole person,” Kim said. “I believe our Jesuit identity helps create a spirit of Georgetown that I wasn’t aware of while applying to colleges, but I’m really glad I found. For me, I would be not only interested in learning about Jesuit history, but [also about] Georgetown’s history of tolerance and ability to be open-minded in a changing world.”
The exhibit will remain open for viewing through the end of February.

Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (GRD ’86, R-Neb.) and former Senator Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), along with former Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and former U.K. Defense Minister Desmond Browne, will discuss nuclear security threats in the 21st century at a March 16 event co-hosted by the Center for Security Studies and the International Relations Club.
Fortenberry, who currently co-chairs the Congressional Nuclear Security Caucus, and Nunn, who is the CEO of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nongovernmental organization focused on reducing the risk of the proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction, each spoke to The Hoya in advance of the event to discuss emerging threats, the ongoing Iranian nuclear negotiations and their desire to involve college students in the issue.
Fortenberry, who co-founded the nuclear security caucus in 2008, noted that advances in technology had made nuclear weapon proliferation even more dangerous, requiring the caucus as a specialized response.
“The technology for nuclear weapons making has spread very rapidly and it will only continue to spread,” Fortenberry said. “And the key here is to develop a heightened awareness and deeper understanding not only in Congress but throughout the world of the great dangers of this so that we can all try to come to some various kinds of agreements that would control particularly the materials that go into nuclear weapons production.”
Of particular concern to Fortenberry was the danger of nuclear material, or even entire weapons, falling into the hands of terrorist organizations.
“The problem in the 21st century is if a non-state actor were to get a hold of a completed nuclear weapon or the materials that could make some sort of rudimentary dirty bomb type element that wouldn’t be destructive as a nuclear weapon itself but nonetheless it could cause widespread damage and panic,” Fortenberry said.
After the September 11 attacks, worries about outdated missile technology and faulty security mechanisms were widespread. Through the efforts of the Nuclear Threat Initiative in setting up the World Institute of Nuclear Security, nuclear material has increasingly been secured around the world.
“The number of states that no longer have any loose fissile material has been cut basically in half,” Fortenberry said.
In addition to the worries over nuclear terrorism, Nunn said that the threat of nuclear war between states still loomed large.
“If you look at it, the old threats haven’t disappeared. … We’re in a new era, but we still have the old ones, so that’s the challenge,” Nunn said. “It’s pretty clear we have significant dangers in terms of possible state conflict.”
Professor of security studies and government Keir Lieber, who will deliver opening remarks at the event, concurred, explaining that the theory of mutually assured destruction, which states that the threat of retaliation would prevent countries from using nuclear weapons, was a false comfort.
“U.S. nuclear policy throughout the Cold War was to escalate conventional war to the nuclear level in order to bring that war to a halt before it was too late,” Lieber said. “Deliberate rational state use of nuclear weapons as part of a coercive escalation strategy is a real danger, and it’s not clear to me that we’ve focused enough attention on this.”
The panel comes in the middle of one such state-centered challenge, the current nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany, who are attempting to curtail Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons.
“Iran has had the knowledge and technical capability to at least enrich and establish their commodities,” Nunn said. “The question is if we can stop them from converting that technical knowhow into making the bomb.”
Acknowledging that governments had much more sway in diplomatic affairs than nongovernmental organizations such as NTI, Nunn said that the challenge of the negotiations was keeping domestic and foreign interests united.
“If you look at the nature of the challenges here in Iran, it’s having Congress and the president work together, and that’s obviously not happening,” Nunn said. “The second major challenge is having the United States and its key ally of Israel working together, and that’s obviously not happening. And the third challenge is keeping the countries that are engaging in the boycott together, Russia, China and Europe. That’s not an easy group to keep together.”
Fortenberry said that he had no direct involvement with the negotiation but was informally involved in diplomatic discussions around the issue: If an agreement is reached with Iran, Congress will have to vote on whether to lift sanctions on the country. Accordingly, the congressman said that the issue of nuclear weapons must be a bipartisan effort, pointing to his relationship with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) with whom he co-founded the nuclear security caucus.
“This is a matter of life and death, it’s what we call an existential issue,” Fortenberry said. “It should transcend any kind of partisan divide.”
On March 16, the two will speak at a panel at Georgetown to attempt to convince college students of the importance of nuclear security in coming years.
“It’s a complicated set of issues, and it doesn’t lend itself necessarily to motivating and exciting people,” Fortenberry said. “The tragedy of what could happen is so great that nobody really wants to look at it, think about it, so that’s why [we’re having] this event. … Hopefully, it gains momentum among the next generation for engagement.”
Since many of the goals of the Nuclear Threat Initiative require a long-term focus, such as significantly reducing the nuclear arsenal, Nunn emphasized the necessity of involving students in the issues.
“I would like to see nuclear weapons eliminated ultimately and have a world with tight verifications … but that’s many years down the road,” Nunn said. “The young generation is going to have to live with this for a long time … so having a knowledge about the dangers here and the continuing challenge for the younger generation is very, very important.”

Prominent nuclear security experts spoke Monday night in the Intercultural Center auditorium on the importance of tackling emerging and evolving nuclear security threats facing the United States and its global allies in the 21st century.
The speakers included former United Kingdom defense minister and Vice Chairman of the Nuclear Threat Initiative Des Browne, Co-Chair of the Congressional Nuclear Security Caucus Congressman Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.), Associate in Nuclear Policy Program and Asia Program for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Duyeon Kim, Visiting Assistant Professor at Georgetown University Ariane Tabatabai, former U.S. senator and President of the Lugar Center Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and former U.S. senator and co-chairman and CEO of the Nuclear Threat Initiative Sam Nunn (D-Ga.).
The panel discussion focused on nuclear material security, nuclear terrorism and nuclear weapons proliferation. The event, titled “Managing and Reducing 21st Century Nuclear Security Threats,” was co-sponsored by Georgetown’s Center for Security Studies and the International Relations Club. Kim moderated and began with a discussion on the importance of securing nuclear materials globally as a way to deter potential nuclear terrorism.
“The world has to understand that protecting nuclear material is the best way, the most efficient, the most effective way to prevent nuclear terrorism,” Nunn said. “The hardest job for the terrorist is the easiest job for us. Once the material gets in the wrong hand, at that stage, every step of the way is more difficult for the good guys, and easier for the bad guys.”
On the 70th anniversary of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Brown emphasized the small amount of material that would be necessary to facilitate nuclear terrorism in comparison with the massive quantities of material present today.
“There is by our estimation, collectively about 2,000 metric tons of weapons-usable material in 25 countries and hundreds of sites in those 25 countries, not all of them secure and well-protected,” Brown said.
Nunn then emphasized the outdated nature of the long-existing strategy of nuclear deterrence in an ever-changing landscape of nuclear terrorism, with unique groups such as the Islamic State entering the playing field.
“Deterrence basically has been the policy of the United States for a long time,” Nunn said. “We have not gotten away from that; we still have deterrents. But the problem here that we have to add to catastrophic terrorism, nuclear terrorism, is that nobody quite knows how you deter a group that doesn’t have a return address.”
The panel then moved to discuss the situation in Russia and Ukraine, highlighting the long-term consequences that current tensions may have on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.
The discussion also emphasized the ongoing importance of managing North Korea’s nuclear ability as vital to global security. Congressman Fortenberry focused on the importance of China when dealing with North Korea and proposed a potential joint nuclear command in South Korea to act as significant leverage against continued nuclear proliferation in the region.
“There are no nuclear weapons in South Korea, but if North Korea continues down this path, then a joint South-Korean-American nuclear command [could act] as a deterrent,” Fortenberry said.
During the question-and-answer session, a major topic of discussion was Iran.
When asked what a potential deal with Iran would look like, Tabatabai stressed the need for transparency in Iran’s nuclear activities as well as clarification of its former military activity.
“I think ideally a good deal would provide the [International Atomic Energy Agency] with enough access to the different facilities, and it would scale back Iran’s program enough, the breakout time of one year which has been on the table for a while,” Tabatabai said.
The discussion ended with Kim asking each panel participant to give a 10-second pitch on how audience members can help in the fight against nuclear proliferation and support nuclear security worldwide.
“Capture the moment, capture the imagination and create a new movement,” Fortenberry said. “The future of civilization is at stake.”
“Learn more,” Lugar said.
Attendee Brad Hong (COL ’16) said he appreciated the opportunity to hear from former and current leaders in nuclear security policy and said that nuclear threat policy is an ongoing, generational issue.
“Though the speakers practiced a healthy relationship of banter amongst each other, none cracked a smile when discussing the ominous possibility that just one instance was enough to change the history of our world,” Hong said.

OWN IT and the Georgetown Office of Public Affairs hosted the second annual OWN IT Summit Saturday in Gaston Hall. The women’s conference aims to bridge the gap between young women and working professionals in a variety of fields.
Approximately 800 attendees from Georgetown and universities around the country including Yale University, University of Notre Dame and Johns Hopkins University attended the summit, which featured over 80 speakers and panelists.
The Hoya conducted exclusive interviews with five of the speakers. The interviews have been edited for clarity and condensed for print.
Danielle Brooks is an actress who attended The Juilliard School and now plays Tasha “Taystee” Jefferson on the Netflix original series “Orange Is the New Black,” which is in its third season.
What advice would you give young women interested in acting?
Brooks: I say go for it. Go full throttle for it. If you’re still green, get educated. There’s so many schools out here; it doesn’t have to be Juilliard. There are so many colleges that can give you what you need where you are. Go get some education. Educate yourself, and go for it.
How do you think that your character, Taystee, in “Orange Is the New Black” is exposing problems for women in the prison system in America?
Brooks: Taystee, you know, she is a child of the system. She has been in and out of prison her whole life. As we see in season one, I believe, she goes in and out. The reason she does is because in prison she had a home, she had a family, she had food on the table and that was comfortable for her. And that’s a problem that we’re having that, where do these prisoners go for rehabilitation? Where do they go to figure out how to live when they get out? And we don’t have enough of that. So I feel like, that’s really the purpose of Taystee when it comes to talking about the issues of the prison systems in America.
Mary Jordan is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for the Washington Post who served as a foreign correspondent for 14 years in over 40 countries.
What’s your advice to young women interested in pursuing journalism?
Jordan: Learn how to write. Work hard. Read everything you can, and go for it because there’s never been more opportunities in journalism, actually. There are many more platforms now. You can blog and you can do radio and you can do print journalism. You can do video. There are a lot of places for people who are curious and just know that it’s a fun job. I always feel like it’s grad school. First, I was in Japan and learned everything about Japanese politics, and then I moved to Mexico and learned everything about Latin American studies, then London and learned about the British parliamentary system. I think journalism is so great, because it’s basically just learning every day and meeting really interesting people.
Norah O’Donnell is a print and television journalist who works as the co-anchor of CBS This Morning, and previously worked as the Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News.
What’s the biggest challenge to be a woman in journalism and how would you encourage young aspiring female journalists?
O’Donnell: I think there are very few challenges for women in journalism. I think it’s a great field for women to enter because it’s largely a meritocracy. If you write a good story, if you investigate something and break a news story, that’s going to be recognized. So, I think many of the talents that women have, which are interests in how policy affects people’s lives, answering the question of why something is, which is the heart of journalism. Those are well-suited to some of the skill sets that many women already have and I think journalism is a great field for women. We need more women in leadership in journalism, and that will take time, but I’m firmly convinced that we are at a turning point. Having met many of the women at Georgetown, I’m confident that we are going to have equality in terms of leadership in journalism very soon.
Megan Smith is the chief technology officer to the United States and was formerly the vice president of GoogleX.
What is the role of U.S. Chief Technology Officer and how have you adapted it?
Smith: The official job is to advise the president and his team on how to harness the power on data efficiency in technology on behalf of the nation. It’s a flexible job. It’s not like you’re supposed to run NASA or run IT websites for the government, it’s really an architecture job and a policy job. …
One of the areas we focus on is the American people. How do we help with skills or entrepreneurial access and what people are able to do, STEM stuff for youth and coding at school and that whole range of things to support the American people and top innovators can also help other people get into innovation. We call it “Innovation Nation,” it’s our nickname. Programs like Tech Hire that we launch that are helping people use code boot camps to get into. There’s five million jobs open in the country, so we’re trying to help people get into the tech jobs there.
What advice would you give young women interested in the technology field?
Smith: The universe doesn’t really divide the subjects up. In school you’re learning science, math, and English and history and music. Being fluent in all those different things is very powerful. … As a student, take a lot of time to sample some things and not shut the door because of stereotypes. Even in children’s television they have some crazy stereotypes. Out of every four characters on kid’s TV only one’s a girl. In STEM fields, only one’s a girl out of five, and in computer science cast on TV it’s fifteen to one. Which is not true for the industry, but it creates this bias in what you think you should do. And then you see classes skewed. But coding is just following instructions like following a recipe or following a list of things to do. Learning how to use that to make things and have impact on the world is really important. We sometimes make people afraid of tech. The way that we teach it, we make people feel dumb and bored and not have people teach by learning. You learn to read and write. But when we teach tech stuff, we teach all these facts, we don’t let you discover or make or invent.
Kara Swisher is a technology journalist who serves as the executive editor of Re/Code, a tech news and analysis website.
As moderator of the Innovation Panel at the summit, what were you trying to get across?
Swisher: Innovation can come in many forms and where is it going. And we have to think very hard as to how we can stay as an innovative country. The U.S. is a leader in technology and innovation but it’s going to lose that fast to China and India and countries that are doing some amazing things. The question is, are we educating our people in a way that is necessary to keep that going, are we providing visas in a way to bring in talent from all over the world, do we have enough focus on the fact that this is going to differentiate ourselves and bring us into the future for a better country and a better world.

Jennifer Huang Bouey, an associate professor of international health at the School of Nursing and Health Studies, received a $50,000 grant to conduct a one-year study on the risk factors and best practices against the HIV epidemic in Washington, D.C., from the District of Columbia Developmental Center for AIDS Research.
Bouey received the grant as part of the D.C. D-CFAR’s Pilot Awards Program, which seeks to provide funds for HIV investigators to assist them in their research. In addition, the organization offers grants to one or two pilot studies per year which they select through a highly selective peer-review process.
The D.C. D-CFAR is a federally funded initiative that aims to promote HIV/AIDS research to end the epidemic in D.C. The organization is composed of six universities and institutes, including Georgetown University, American University and the Children’s National Medical Center.
Bouey said that she hopes her research will increase awareness and support for individuals in D.C. with a high risk for HIV.
“I am very happy to receive this funding as it marks the start of a new direction in my research,” Bouey wrote in an email. “It takes a long time to foster a rapport to work with local communities that serve high-risk populations. This D.C. D-CFAR funding in a way confirmed the success of our longtime effort to create an academic community team in Washington D.C. to work with this marginalized population at high risk for HIV.”
NHS Interim Dean Patricia Cloonan, said that Bouey’s research would continue the NHS’s mission of serving marginalized communities.
“As she expands her focus to include our local community, it is great that she has received this funding to support her work,” Cloonan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our school seeks to advance the health and well-being of all people with a particular attention on the underserved and marginalized.”
Bouey’s previous research includes seven years of community-based work with rural-to-urban migrant women in China. With this one-year pilot study, Bouey plans to build upon her research in the context of the United States.
“Migration and sexual violence are two precursors highly correlated with HIV and STI among female commercial sex workers worldwide,” Bouey wrote. “The relationship between these factors has not previously been explored in urban areas of the United States and the impact of such violence on the biological plausibility for STI and HIV infection has not been well established.”
Bouey stressed the importance of the pilot study in D.C., a center of commercial sex work where there is a high risk of STI and HIV infection for female residents and travellers.
“The nation’s capital has already been identified as a hub for commercial sex work along the East Coast corridor,” Bouey wrote. “This is problematic given the city’s high HIV prevalence rates, among the highest in the United States. Thus, women travelling into this environment to engage in sex work may face a greatly increased risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. Developing interventions that can effectively reach this travelling population and gather data from them are urgently needed.”
The project will involve a multidisciplinary team of experts in community and behavioral research, immunology, gynecology and epidemiology from Georgetown and George Washington University. The team will also work with long-time local community organization Helping Individual Prostitutes Survive, which promotes the health and rights of drug users, sex workers and their communities.
According to Bouey, the pilot study will cover a range of research methods, including both qualitative and quantitative approaches to gathering data.
“We will start with qualitative focus group discussions and in-depth interviews,” Bouey wrote. “The interviews will help us obtain firsthand data from community organizations, public health agencies, policymakers, and female sex workers. We also provide HIV/HCV testing and collect immunology biomarkers.”
Bouey also said that the bridging of these various types of research methods is important not only in obtaining data, but also in serving as a model for future multidisciplinary research.
“Research involving the collection of biological material has encountered low participation rates, due to a history of unethical public health research in the United States,” Bouey wrote. “Our study will serve as a model that bridges bench science, behavioral research and community participation to develop a ‘best practice’ model that will eventually benefit both scientific research and marginalized high-risk populations.”
Manavi Bhagwat (NHS ’16), one of Bouey’s students who will take part in the upcoming pilot study this summer, expressed her excitement about working more closely with Bouey.
“I’m incredibly impressed,” Bhagwat said. “When she described the project to me, I was pretty amazed at the fact that she was able to translate her experience in international health to the D.C. area and work on a project so close to home. I’m sure she’s going to be very successful with her project.”

As Georgetown readies for the influx of prospective freshmen this weekend, another individual is conducting a college tour of his own — Admiral Cecil Haney, the commander of U.S. Strategic Command.
USSTRATCOM, one of the nine unified combatant commands under the Department of Defense, is responsible for the United States’ strategic capability through facets such as cyberspace operations, joint electronic warfare, and intelligence and reconnaissance. The four-star admiral is also the shepherd of the country’s nuclear deterrence force.
Keir Lieber, a professor in the government department and School of Foreign Service whose work focuses on nuclear weapons and strategy, met Haney at a conference in Omaha, Neb., where the latter expressed his interest in visiting college campuses. Haney’s visit to Georgetown follows on the heels of trips to Stanford University and the University of Nebraska Omaha. He delivered a lecture on 21st-century deterrence to Professor Matthew Kroenig’s introduction to international relations class Thursday.
He spoke with The Hoya about his outreach initiative, the state of the United States’ nuclear arsenal and the impact of current events.
 
In your lecture, you outlined an interest in visiting colleges and connecting with students. What sparked this interest?
 
The interest I had actually stimulated some thinking of how our country at large is not looking at thinking about, on the world stage, this coalition of events and the various threats we have. A lot of concern over lots of articles in various publications that sort of have these great theories of nuclear weapons that we have in our arsenal today, these cold war relics, without a balanced approach.
That we have to strive for a world free of nuclear weapons is a good thing that I support, but we have to do it in a balanced approach or we’ll lose strategic stability. Seeing so many unbalanced products out there really caught my attention to stimulate more discussions. There is no more fertile ground than college campuses. Then I wanted to be able to not just have any college campus but be able to have some of these universities like Georgetown that have in-depth faculty and students that are very interested in international affairs, international relationships, balance of power and those kinds of things.
 
Is this focus on a Generation Z deliberate or formalized initiative, or is it just out of personal interest?
It was only something to connect to the young folks in the audience. In some regards, I’m not very big at stereotyping any group but to use that to look at the dimension between those giants like Kissinger, et cetera, and the giants we need to have from this generation going forward.
 
Could you outline the vital importance of nuclear weapons today?
Nuclear weapons today provide us a nuclear deterrent and assurance capability that is important, given the fact that we have other nations that have nuclear weapons. Also from the assurance side, providing that nuclear umbrella we have agreed to with other nations so that we can have less nations deciding their own nuclear capability.
 
And aside from this deterrence and assurance, can nuclear weapons play additional roles on the world stage to elicit different things?
I would say that nuclear weapons are first and foremost about the business of strategic deterrence. It’s about maintaining strategic stability and not just with nuclear weapons by themselves, but with strategic capabilities. As I mentioned, space and cyberspace have a role to play in this regard. But it’s part of whole government strategic deterrent and assurance activities that by themselves require that whole government kind of approach in order to be successful.
 
What would you identify as threats where deterrents might fail?
It’s the unthinkable, but we would not want deterrence to fail first and foremost. If deterrence fails, we would want the conflict terminated as early as possible and in our favor. So consequently, the business of having that capability to go about deterrence first is also to remind any adversary that would want to escalate their way through a conflict in the nuclear kind of extreme circumstances that they won’t get the benefits they aim to achieve. That restraint is a much better option.
 
What is the most likely scenario in which the United States would use a nuclear weapon?
First and foremost, the actual order to use a nuclear weapon in air is one that can only come from the president of the United States. I’m very careful not to hypothesize how his decision calculus would work in those cases. I would say it would be a waiting decision first and foremost, as it was when we look back in our history of the utilization of the atomic bomb in World War II. I hope we don’t have those kinds of circumstances in the future if we use our deterrence and assurance mission correctly.
 
What constitutes your biggest priority on a macro scale and what is your day-to-day focus?
Well, day-to-day and macro is to provide deterrence and to deter strategic attacks against the United States of America or its allies and provide the president options if deterrence fails. Clearly we don’t have that latter on a day-to-day basis but maintaining the readiness of the strategic forces, whether they’re in the nuclear part of my business line, the space or cyberspace part, missile defense et cetera and those mission areas to ensure the readiness is there in order to support our overall joint military operations.
 
Do you find yourself on a day-to-day basis focusing more on cyberspace, electronic warfare, or another priority?
 
Haney: On a day-to-day basis for example, I start my morning [at 7 a.m.] in the morning operations and intelligence brief that covers the world, in particularly strategic activities in the world and all of my mission areas that are relevant. It also covers the readiness of my operational forces and capability in terms of things. And then of course you have immediate priorities but those may be associated with some exercise that I may be working to do with my associative forces and capabilities or support that I provide to the other combat and commands.
 
How would you describe the attention given to the state of the nuclear arsenal programs since the end of the Cold War?
I would say one, here in 2014, we had several things occur. One that was a very good one was a real deep look at the nuclear deterrent enterprise, and that’s all the various things that support this particular mission through service capabilities associated all the way down to the equip part that supports our nuclear and strategic missions.
With that, in our budget to reprocess, there was a recognition that things had to be supported in order to have a safe and effective capability well into the future. We had those associated deliberations and the associated support in recognition that this is an important mission for our country, for homeland security et cetera.
 
In talking about the modernization of the arsenal, what would you describe is a necessary scope for modernization, and to what extent should the United States devote funding to just pure maintenance? 
First, for my organization, as I indicated during the discussion, we have been operating a lot of our capability well beyond its design life when it was first created. It’s a good thing in terms of the American ingenuity, to know what went into those systems and our ability to also improve the longevity of some of those systems — the various platforms or the submarines aircraft and the intercontinental ballistic missile.
We have been able to do life extension programs and have initiated some on our warheads as well as the business of ensuring we have surveillance programs. They are also in the process of making sure this business works — that it is safe, secure and effective. But, like most things, they eventually time out and we have to replace the stuff before it times out. That’s why part of the modernization is in one case, the survival leg of our deterrent capability of submarines. We have to start the work that replaces those submarines so as these we have today decommission, we have a replacement form so we continue to have that survival leg. That’s just one of the modernizations examples.
 
How would you balance modernization and maintenance?
Well, the balance here is you have to sustain the capability that you have but you can’t just run it to death, you can’t fly airplanes and just continue to fly them, you have to take and run them through a maintenance period in order for them to continue to last the lifespan you desire as best you can, before they will still eventually time out. The modernization period is important because they either provide you better capability or give you a renewed insurance policy if you will that will last you many more decades to come beyond where this existing capability will time out. So both are important because if you don’t sustain what you have to get to the point where the new modernized equipment can come online without having a gap. A gap in this kind of capability will have a major impact to strategic stability.
 
In a 2009 speech in Prague, President Barack Obama stated a commitment to disarmament. How does this commitment affect the also-stated commitment to deterrence and modernization?
In 2009, when President Obama gave the Prague speech, he stated clearly that the goal was to have the world free of nuclear weapons. He also articulated that the likelihood of it occurring in his lifetime was not very high at all and that as long as the world was not free of nuclear weapons, the United States of America would have a safe, secure and effective nuclear arsenal. That latter piece is often not included in the first piece and it’s important because it’s not that long of a paragraph that that’s part of the whole president’s statement instead of cookie-cutter-ing it up in bite-size chunks.
 
What steps, considering the commitment to disarmament in some form was articulated, are being taken to eventually reach that?
Well, when you look at, and I don’t know if you saw the one slide I had in there that showed the number of nuclear warheads we had in our stockpile over time, and we had over 30,000 back in the late sixties, and today when you see how we have reduced that in every area, whether it’s the number of warheads, number of submarines, number of bombers, number of intercontinental ballistic missiles, we have decreased the numbers. In fact, we’re working diligently, and we’ll get there for the new start treaty limits, which were required to be there by 2018. The piece I emphasize is that we have continually over time done reductions, but part of this requires arms control agreements that are verifiable, that are not unilateral so that we can maintain strategic stability as we come down in numbers.
 
How would you describe Russia’s compliance with New START and how does this affect the United States?
Russia has completely complied with the treaty. This treaty allows us to do a number of inspections on them per year and inspections on our capability per year and they go on throughout the year and have not been impeded whatsoever on either side so far. They’re complying [with] the New START Treaty. It’s the [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces] treaty that they have violated and we are hoping that they will come back on board in compliance with the INF and treaty.
 
How does this violation of the INF treaty affect the U.S.’s plan and response?
Well, as in any overall negotiation, number one to identify the problem and number two continue discussions with Russia over getting them back on board associated with treaty compliance. While at the same time ensuring that the rest of the world understands where they are, Russia as a nation state, and we would hope they would respect the international norms by the treaties they have signed up to be a part of. The real question and I don’t know the answer to it would be, “Why did Russia walk away from this treaty?” and then, “What are they planning on doing with this kind of capability in the future?” Too early to tell at this point.
 
In terms of the nuclear umbrella, in terms of extending protection to allies, how credible is this umbrella and how sustainable is it today with the shifting alliances with the new treaties and things like that?
The credibility of our strategic deterrence and our insurance umbrella we provide our allies is fully on board and implemented today. We’re not taking any shortcuts in that regard even as we work toward our New START treaty requirements, those we take into account as we move through those particular deliberations.
 
In terms of the U.S.’s program of deterrence in Asia, as China expands its power protections and its influence in the region, how does that credibility sustain itself?
China as a nation has grown economically and they’re in the process of also modernizing their overall military capability. Our hope in the various mechanisms working with China is that they will rise to the level on the international stage as a responsible actor, and that requires a certain bit of transparency associated with intention as well as capability. As we have been in the western Pacific arena for years, our allies and partners, we have five of our seven treaty allies are in the western Pacific area and as a result we take those commitments seriously, and we will continue to work with our allies and partners as we continue to work with China quite frankly on a policy level.
 
Should a deal be reached with Iran, what do you think the effectiveness would be and how would it change strategic anticipation?
First and foremost, we have, as a country, worked this P5+1 framework, which as I mentioned during my remarks I’m encouraged by that, to get Iran as a responsible player in the international community. It’s really up to Iran whether or not Iran will work within this framework in order to have an agreement that can be, again, verifiable and they have to be committed to that going forward.
 
That framework was obviously reached by diplomatic negotiations. Did you have any input?
This framework is led by, as you’ve seen on TV and everything, Secretary [John] Kerry. The secretary of state has been at the forefront associated with this. My job is associated with providing strategic deterrence capabilities and that’s clearly not an area in my lane. Iran is not in the area of responsibility of another geographical combatant command.
 
Cyberspace, especially today, and you mentioned this extensively, is hailed as both a modern frontier and a realm of modern warfare. How much of a shift have you seen in terms of addressing threats on the cyber front, and how weighted now is your work in cyberspace?
As you many have seen, building our cyberspace capabilities and capacity was my fourth listed priority of the six shown up there today. It’s been there throughout my tenure as the combatant commander of strategic command. It was also listed on my predecessor’s priorities in terms of things. As such we have worked not just in terms of investment in the building of talent, but also in terms of ensuring we’re organized so that we can work efficiently and effectively in defending the Department of Defense information network and to be able to be responsive to the needs of our country. My sub-unified command, U.S. Cyber Command, works across the board with other interagency partners associated with that mission.
 
Of the priorities of strategic command, what would you identify as posing the greatest challenge to tackle?
In execution of all of them, the biggest challenge right now facing our country is how we deal with the Budget Control Act in terms of how we fund our military apparatus at large given the complex, dynamic and uncertain security environment we’re in right now. Getting that piece figured out, so that we can look to have stable funding and the necessary funding we need so we can continue to work to protect our democratic values and our way of life in this country.
 
 
Given your responsibilities, what keeps you up at night?
First and foremost, when you work as hard as I do and you finally get horizontal, you’re asleep at night. But as I mentioned here, it’s multidimensional. First and foremost, that we as a country work to have the ability to be able to have the necessary defense capabilities we need given the threats that are upon us and that we will have a deliberate approach to funding the defense, and I don’t mean just the Department of Defense, but all those other things that ensure our homeland security and ensure the safety of our citizens abroad, and our commitments to our allies and partners is very important as we look at a whole laundry list of complex issues that we’re about.

As students rushed to and from their classes in the Edmund A. Walsh Memorial building this week, they passed by a nondescript gold shipping container on N Street — unaware that, inside, unprecedented conversations were taking place.
Participants who stepped into the box, titled the “Portal to Afghanistan,” were digitally transported thousands of miles away to have a full-body video chat with a complete stranger in Herat, Afghanistan.
This interactive box studio uses multimedia technology to create accessible, secure and meaningful encounters between people in Washington, D.C., and those in Afghanistan. Developed by emerging artist Amar Bakshi, Portal to Afghanistan is on display at 3622 N St. from April 7 to 18 and offers a unique experience for those interested in exploring how creative use of technology could empower cross-cultural communication. Shared Studios entirely manages and organizes each private session, and interested community members can sign up for a 15-minute session on Shared Studio’s website
“Technology really allows people to talk to one another, but too often new tools are not used to connect people who likely would not otherwise meet,” Bakshi said. “Portals grounds these technologies in a particular context and community that creates room for de-instrumentalized encounters between strangers. Often we use the tools at our disposal online to strengthen our own networks rather than reaching out to strangers across various divides. Portals provide a different avenue to create encounters between people.”
Shared Portals, which includes Portal to Afghanistan, is a major initiative under Shared Studios, a multidisciplinary arts, design and technology collective focused on connecting people from diverse populations and carving wormholes throughout the world. Inside the portals, which are modified from shipping containers and equipped with audio-visual technology, one comes face-to-face with someone in another container anywhere in the world. The two subjects then engage in a conversation as if in the same room.
Since the launch of Shared Portals in December 2014, more than a thousand people in Iran and the United States have carried on private, 15-minute conversations with strangers from the other country. In the past few months, Shared Portals placed exhibits at Yale University and the Lu Magnus Art Gallery in New York City. This time, due to a new partnership with professors at the University of Herat, Shared Portals is bringing its real-time correspondence to Afghanistan for the first time.
The Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics at Georgetown is hosting the Portal Project after reaching out to Bakshi expressing interest in collaboration. Lab Co-Founder and Co-Director Cynthia Schneider, distinguished professor in the practice of diplomacy, said that Georgetown thought the art installation would complement a larger initiative and performance by the Lab in partnership with the Georgetown Department of Performing Arts entitled “Generation (Wh)Y.” The “theatrical experience,” which will incorporate multimedia aspects, was created after Georgetown students experienced video interactions with students from Egypt, Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Qatar and Iraq, among other countries. According to the Department of Performing Arts’ website, the project will run April 17 and 18 in the Davis Performing Arts Center.
“We used intimate live performances and web-based technology and social media platforms to allow viewers to move through multiple spaces exploring real experiences from global voices and the poetry of everyday life,” DPAC Artistic Director Derek Goldman, the Lab co-founder and co-director, said. “It celebrates different encounters that people are having with folks around the world.”
Schneider said she believes that Georgetown’s portal is an invaluable chance to foster deeper cross-cultural understanding.
“In the wake of President [Mohammad Ashraf] Ghani’s visit, we have heard a hopeful message for Afghanistan’s future and for the ongoing positive cooperation between our two countries,” Schneider said. “But against that backdrop come reports of continued violence, endemic poverty, and other challenges. The Portal provides the chance to understand how ordinary Afghans view their lives and their future.”
Bakshi said he envisions that the use of technology could transform the way people communicate and shape their ideas of group identity. He also indicated that he chose shipping containers as a medium to unite participants in a common space with deep symbolism.
“Using shipping containers also has symbolic value, by making a mundane artifact more meaningful and creating a moment around it,” Bakshi said. “Shipping containers are a symbol of global commerce and a trade-centric culture. Here I want to re-purpose these containers  in a consistent way and to facilitate de-instrumentalized encounters. The myriad associations enhance this context.”
Those participating in the exchange are expected to respond to the same prompt: “What would make today a good day for you?” Bakshi said the question encourages participants to speak about details of their daily lives and touch on the small things that make a long-lasting memory for them.
During one of the 15-minute conversations that took place on Wednesday, two participants shared insights about their lives, college experiences and personal viewpoints on philosophy and religion. Afghan college student Mohammad Yones said he taught his partner on the other side of the screen greeting phrases in Persian, which carry the meaning of “I wish you happiness.”
After leaving the Portal, participants write about their experiences in a gold book, which are then published on the project’s website.
Besides the 15 minute individual appointments, the Portal can also be used for off-hours reservations for longer stretches of time, enabling artists, students or academics to converse or collaborate.
In the future, Bakshi anticipates the Portal to expand to more countries and more diverse populations. Potential future destinations include Iraq, Monrovia, Liberia and China. Shared Portals hopes to create a portal installation in a different location each month for the next six months.
“The conversation pair does not need to be super-charged,” Bakshi said. “One day you might have Moscow and Ukraine, but it could also be two parts of D.C. The idea is having two groups engage across varying forms of distance.”
“Through the Portal, I gained a friend who reminds me that education, electricity and the economy are not things to take for granted,” Ramjit said.

Could you outline the vital importance of nuclear weapons today?
Nuclear weapons today provide us a nuclear deterrent and assurance capability that is important, given the fact that we have other nations that have nuclear weapons. Also from the assurance side, providing that nuclear umbrella we have agreed to with other nations so that we can have less nations deciding their own nuclear capability.
And aside from this deterrence and assurance, can nuclear weapons play additional roles on the world stage to elicit different things?
I would say that nuclear weapons are first and foremost about the business of strategic deterrence. It’s about maintaining strategic stability and not just with nuclear weapons by themselves, but with strategic capabilities. As I mentioned, space and cyberspace have a role to play in this regard. But it’s part of whole government strategic deterrent and assurance activities that by themselves require that whole government kind of approach in order to be successful.
What would you identify as threats where deterrents might fail?
It’s the unthinkable, but we would not want deterrence to fail first and foremost. If deterrence fails, we would want the conflict terminated as early as possible and in our favor. So consequently, the business of having that capability to go about deterrence first is also to remind any adversary that would want to escalate their way through a conflict in the nuclear kind of extreme circumstances that they won’t get the benefits they aim to achieve. That restraint is a much better option.
What is the most likely scenario in which the United States would use a nuclear weapon?
First and foremost, the actual order to use a nuclear weapon in air is one that can only come from the president of the United States. I’m very careful not to hypothesize how his decision calculus would work in those cases. I would say it would be a waiting decision first and foremost, as it was when we look back in our history of the utilization of the atomic bomb in World War II. I hope we don’t have those kinds of circumstances in the future if we use our deterrence and assurance mission correctly.
What constitutes your biggest priority on a macro scale and what is your day-to-day focus?
Well, day-to-day and macro is to provide deterrence and to deter strategic attacks against the United States of America or its allies and provide the president options if deterrence fails. Clearly we don’t have that latter on a day-to-day basis but maintaining the readiness of the strategic forces, whether they’re in the nuclear part of my business line, the space or cyberspace part, missile defense et cetera and those mission areas to ensure the readiness is there in order to support our overall joint military operations.
Do you find yourself on a day-to-day basis focusing more on cyberspace, electronic warfare, or another priority?
On a day-to-day basis for example, I start my morning [at 7 a.m.] in the morning operations and intelligence brief that covers the world, in particularly strategic activities in the world and all of my mission areas that are relevant. It also covers the readiness of my operational forces and capability in terms of things. And then of course you have immediate priorities but those may be associated with some exercise that I may be working to do with my associative forces and capabilities or support that I provide to the other combat and commands.
How would you describe the attention given to the state of the nuclear arsenal programs since the end of the Cold War?
I would say one, here in 2014, we had several things occur. One that was a very good one was a real deep look at the nuclear deterrent enterprise, and that’s all the various things that support this particular mission through service capabilities associated all the way down to the equip part that supports our nuclear and strategic missions.
With that, in our budget to reprocess, there was a recognition that things had to be supported in order to have a safe and effective capability well into the future. We had those associated deliberations and the associated support in recognition that this is an important mission for our country, for homeland security et cetera.
In talking about the modernization of the arsenal, what would you describe is a necessary scope for modernization, and to what extent should the United States devote funding to just pure maintenance?
First, for my organization, as I indicated during the discussion, we have been operating a lot of our capability well beyond its design life when it was first created. It’s a good thing in terms of the American ingenuity, to know what went into those systems and our ability to also improve the longevity of some of those systems — the various platforms or the submarines aircraft and the intercontinental ballistic missile.
We have been able to do life extension programs and have initiated some on our warheads as well as the business of ensuring we have surveillance programs. They are also in the process of making sure this business works — that it is safe, secure and effective. But, like most things, they eventually time out and we have to replace the stuff before it times out. That’s why part of the modernization is in one case, the survival leg of our deterrent capability of submarines. We have to start the work that replaces those submarines so as these we have today decommission, we have a replacement form so we continue to have that survival leg. That’s just one of the modernizations examples.
How would you balance modernization and maintenance?
Well, the balance here is you have to sustain the capability that you have but you can’t just run it to death, you can’t fly airplanes and just continue to fly them, you have to take and run them through a maintenance period in order for them to continue to last the lifespan you desire as best you can, before they will still eventually time out. The modernization period is important because they either provide you better capability or give you a renewed insurance policy if you will that will last you many more decades to come beyond where this existing capability will time out. So both are important because if you don’t sustain what you have to get to the point where the new modernized equipment can come online without having a gap. A gap in this kind of capability will have a major impact to strategic stability.
In a 2009 speech in Prague, President Barack Obama stated a commitment to disarmament. How does this commitment affect the also-stated commitment to deterrence and modernization?
In 2009, when President Obama gave the Prague speech, he stated clearly that the goal was to have the world free of nuclear weapons. He also articulated that the likelihood of it occurring in his lifetime was not very high at all and that as long as the world was not free of nuclear weapons, the United States of America would have a safe, secure and effective nuclear arsenal. That latter piece is often not included in the first piece and it’s important because it’s not that long of a paragraph that that’s part of the whole president’s statement instead of cookie-cutter-ing it up in bite-size chunks.
What steps, considering the commitment to disarmament in some form was articulated, are being taken to eventually reach that?
Well, when you look at, and I don’t know if you saw the one slide I had in there that showed the number of nuclear warheads we had in our stockpile over time, and we had over 30,000 back in the late sixties, and today when you see how we have reduced that in every area, whether it’s the number of warheads, number of submarines, number of bombers, number of intercontinental ballistic missiles, we have decreased the numbers. In fact, we’re working diligently, and we’ll get there for the new start treaty limits, which were required to be there by 2018. The piece I emphasize is that we have continually over time done reductions, but part of this requires arms control agreements that are verifiable, that are not unilateral so that we can maintain strategic stability as we come down in numbers.
How would you describe Russia’s compliance with New START and how does this affect the United States?
Russia has completely complied with the treaty. This treaty allows us to do a number of inspections on them per year and inspections on our capability per year and they go on throughout the year and have not been impeded whatsoever on either side so far. They’re complying [with] the New START Treaty. It’s the [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces] treaty that they have violated and we are hoping that they will come back on board in compliance with the INF and treaty.
How does this violation of the INF treaty affect the U.S.’s plan and response?
Well, as in any overall negotiation, number one to identify the problem and number two continue discussions with Russia over getting them back on board associated with treaty compliance. While at the same time ensuring that the rest of the world understands where they are, Russia as a nation state, and we would hope they would respect the international norms by the treaties they have signed up to be a part of. The real question and I don’t know the answer to it would be, “Why did Russia walk away from this treaty?” and then, “What are they planning on doing with this kind of capability in the future?” Too early to tell at this point.
In terms of the nuclear umbrella, in terms of extending protection to allies, how credible is this umbrella and how sustainable is it today with the shifting alliances with the new treaties and things like that?
The credibility of our strategic deterrence and our insurance umbrella we provide our allies is fully on board and implemented today. We’re not taking any shortcuts in that regard even as we work toward our New START treaty requirements, those we take into account as we move through those particular deliberations.
In terms of the U.S.’s program of deterrence in Asia, as China expands its power protections and its influence in the region, how does that credibility sustain itself?
China as a nation has grown economically and they’re in the process of also modernizing their overall military capability. Our hope in the various mechanisms working with China is that they will rise to the level on the international stage as a responsible actor, and that requires a certain bit of transparency associated with intention as well as capability. As we have been in the western Pacific arena for years, our allies and partners, we have five of our seven treaty allies are in the western Pacific area and as a result we take those commitments seriously, and we will continue to work with our allies and partners as we continue to work with China quite frankly on a policy level.
Should a deal be reached with Iran, what do you think the effectiveness would be and how would it change strategic anticipation?
First and foremost, we have, as a country, worked this P5+1 framework, which as I mentioned during my remarks I’m encouraged by that, to get Iran as a responsible player in the international community. It’s really up to Iran whether or not Iran will work within this framework in order to have an agreement that can be, again, verifiable and they have to be committed to that going forward.
That framework was obviously reached by diplomatic negotiations. Did you have any input?
This framework is led by, as you’ve seen on TV and everything, Secretary [John] Kerry. The secretary of state has been at the forefront associated with this. My job is associated with providing strategic deterrence capabilities and that’s clearly not an area in my lane. Iran is not in the area of responsibility of another geographical combatant command.
Cyberspace, especially today, and you mentioned this extensively, is hailed as both a modern frontier and a realm of modern warfare. How much of a shift have you seen in terms of addressing threats on the cyber front, and how weighted now is your work in cyberspace?
As you many have seen, building our cyberspace capabilities and capacity was my fourth listed priority of the six shown up there today. It’s been there throughout my tenure as the combatant commander of strategic command. It was also listed on my predecessor’s priorities in terms of things. As such we have worked not just in terms of investment in the building of talent, but also in terms of ensuring we’re organized so that we can work efficiently and effectively in defending the Department of Defense information network and to be able to be responsive to the needs of our country. My sub-unified command, U.S. Cyber Command, works across the board with other interagency partners associated with that mission.
Of the priorities of strategic command, what would you identify as posing the greatest challenge to tackle?
In execution of all of them, the biggest challenge right now facing our country is how we deal with the Budget Control Act in terms of how we fund our military apparatus at large given the complex, dynamic and uncertain security environment we’re in right now. Getting that piece figured out, so that we can look to have stable funding and the necessary funding we need so we can continue to work to protect our democratic values and our way of life in this country.
Given your responsibilities, what keeps you up at night?
First and foremost, when you work as hard as I do and you finally get horizontal, you’re asleep at night. But as I mentioned here, it’s multidimensional. First and foremost, that we as a country work to have the ability to be able to have the necessary defense capabilities we need given the threats that are upon us and that we will have a deliberate approach to funding the defense, and I don’t mean just the Department of Defense, but all those other things that ensure our homeland security and ensure the safety of our citizens abroad, and our commitments to our allies and partners is very important as we look at a whole laundry list of complex issues that we’re about.

The Honorable Omar Abdullah, the former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, delivered his first address at an American university in Gaston Hall on Tuesday. Abdullah discussed his tenure as chief minister and the road forward for the troubled region in his keynote address that closed out the Kashmir Conclave, a series of panel discussions on Kashmir.
The School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program and the Georgetown-India Dialogue hosted the conclave, which included panels on “Security Concerns,” “Politics and Identity” and “Kashmir’s Importance Today in the India-Pakistan Relationship.”
Abdullah, 44, completed his six-year term as chief minister in December 2014, and is the youngest Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir in the 67-year history of the state. He is currently a Member of the Legislative Assembly and former president of the National Conference Party.
Abdullah comes from a prominent political family; both his grandfather and father both served as chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir.
Berkley Center director and Vice President for Global Engagement Thomas F. Banchoff introduced Abdullah.
Banchoff thanked professor Irfan Nooruddin, the Asian Studies Program, and the Georgetown-India Dialogue for their participation, and spoke about Georgetown’s role in the day of panels.
“We are an institution with strong expertise and robust networks around international issues, and as an institution we are committed to promoting greater understanding and collaboration in the service of the global common good,” Banchoff said.
Abdullah began his talk by expressing his discontent that, after seven decades of skirmishes and protests over India’s and Pakistan’s land claims of Jammu and Kashmir, there is still so much controversy surrounding the area.
“I had hoped long before this that the issue would have been put to rest and that we would be discussing a whole lot of other things with regard to India and Pakistan, but not Jammu and Kashmir,” Abdullah said.
Abdullah focused much of the first part of his talk on explaining the history of the Kashmir land controversy.
“Although it started to be described by various presidents here and other influential people as the most dangerous place in the world, I dare say that perhaps at one point in time it might have been; it certainly isn’t today,” Abdullah said.
Abdullah said that the 1947 partition—when India and Pakistan came into existence — led to a number of issues, especially because Jammu and Kashmir had a Muslim majority and a Hindu ruler.
“Because Jammu and Kashmir is a Muslim majority state, Pakistan felt that it should naturally have been a part of Pakistan, and on the other side India felt that Jammu and Kashmir symbolized what India is supposed to be about, which was a pluralistic, secular society,” Abdullah said.
Jammu and Kashmir decided to stay an independent state following the partition and was subsequently invaded by Pakistani militants whose occupation continue even today in some regions. Despite this, India only agreed to help Jammu and Kashmir if the maharaja, the ruler of India, signed an instrument of accession. This instrument of accession gave India power over the state’s currency, communication, defense and foreign affairs.
Abdullah said that the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution stating that the responsibility was on Pakistan to remove its uniformed nationals from Jammu and Kashmir. After the Pakistani nationals are removed, responsibility is on India to scale back its presence in the contested area so that the people can choose a course of governance.
Abdullah then turned his attention to the future of Jammu and Kashmir and the path to resolving the conflict. Many things have changed since 1947, according to Abdullah. Not only is the Pakistani side of Jammu and Kashmir currently a very different ethnic make-up than it was in the past, but Pakistan has also ceded some of its territory to China.
Abdullah said that because Jammu and Kashmir did not technically merge with India, it cannot be treated on par with other states in the area, and that this is a key aspect of resolving the conflict.
“Militancy in Jammu and Kashmir has had a number of very tragic facets including an almost complete exodus of the Kashmiri Pandit community from Jammu and Kashmir,” Abdullah said.
Abdullah added that democratic and government institutions have almost disappeared, human rights are being denied, and security forces operate with a sense of almost complete immunity from prosecution under the civil courts.
“A solution to Jammu and Kashmir is not going to emerge out of violence, war, or terrorism,” Abdullah said. “After 25 years of militancy and countless deaths in Jammu and Kashmir, but not an inch of territory has moved either towards the west or towards the east.
Although levels of violence in Jammu and Kashmir are almost 80 percent lower than they were in 2000, nothing has changed in terms of the laws giving immunity to security forces. Abdullah called for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate war crimes over the past 25 years.
Abdullah ended his talk by saying that though there are barely any families in Jammu and Kashmir not touched by violence, it is no longer the dangerous place it once was.
“Don’t look at Jammu and Kashmir as the most dangerous place in the world,” Abdullah said. “It isn’t. It certainly is one of the most beautiful places in the world.”
Attendee Gonzalo Figar, a first-year Master of Science in Foreign Service student, said that the Kashmir conflict is one of the most uncontrollable global conflicts and that the world should be involved and concerned.
“The speech was pretty comprehensive and honest on behalf of an Indian politician,” Figar said of the keynote address. “It wasn’t an impartial speech, although of course I didn’t expect it to be. It was of course balanced more towards the Indian point of view, but he did raise some concern about India’s attitude too, so all-in-all it was very interesting.”

The university announced today that it will participate as a partner school in the Three-Campus Consortium for Comparative East Asian Studies program, a study abroad initiative in which students study at three universities in Japan, Korea and Hong Kong for a full-year or half-year time span.
The program, which is jointly hosted by Keio University in Japan, Yonsei University in South Korea and the University of Hong Kong, allows students interested in East Asian studies to spend three equal parts of the program at each respective university.
Initially an exchange program for students at the three universities, the eight-year-old program has since partnered with universities in the United States and England, such as Princeton University, Cornell University, King’s College London and, mostly recently, Georgetown.
According to a program summary posted on the Office of Global Education website, the goal of the program is to help students develop an understanding of the East Asia region through both academic and cultural experiences.
“The program is designed to provide an in-depth academic and cultural experience in Comparative East Asian Studies, enhancing students’ regional expertise and understanding of the dynamic regional and global relationships that Japan, South Korea and China have with each other and the wider world,” the summary reads.
Students can apply for the program in the fall, then study at the universities from late January to early August.
Students receive 17 credits from the half-year program and are required to take one language course in Japanese, Korean or Chinese. Courses will be offered in disciplines such as political science, international studies and political economy.
The website also mentions that students are likely to benefit from the small number of student participants in the program.
“Participants benefit from close connections with a small cohort of local honor students from Keio, Yonsei and HKU, as well as from collaboration with select students from U.S. and international universities,” the website reads.

Jeong Kwang-il, a former political prisoner at Camp Yodok in North Korea, spoke about his experiences in the camp at an event hosted by Truth and Human Rights in North Korea Thursday at the Mortara Center.
Jeong was arrested by the North Korean government in 1999 after he contacted a South Korean citizen while he was on a trip to China. After he was tortured, he falsely confessed to being a spy and was sent to the camp.
Jeong then spent three years in the camp, where he and other prisoners were forced into hard labor under brutal conditions. He was released in 2003 after a senior guard determined he had been wrongly accused.
One month after his release, he escaped North Korea, arriving in South Korea a year later. Once there, he became involved with various advocacy movements to raise awareness within North Korea about human rights violations and to bring information from the rest of the world into the country.
Jeong said that while he was at Yodok, he found that many of the other prisoners shared similar experiences of wrongful imprisonment.
“There were so many people there who weren’t actual political enemies, but who simply uttered something that was deemed offensive,” Jeong said. “They were sent to a prison camp, or tried to escape to China and were arrested by Chinese authorities and ended up in Yodok.”
According to Jeong, prisoners faced daily abuse from guards. The prisoners’ labor consisted of pulling weeds and cutting logs. Jeong said that prisoners who fell behind in their work faced beatings or other punishments.
“At Yodok, prisoners were forced to work 16 hours a day, which was very physically demanding,” Jeong said. “If you did not complete your assigned work quota, you were not given food for that particular day. It was a very difficult situation.”
Jeong said that prisoners worked from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. and were only permitted to eat one bowl of rice and vegetable soup. At the end of every day, Jeong said that they were forced to take a class for political re-education and were not allowed to sleep until they memorized what they had learned.
“What I experienced at Yoda was inhumane and the time that I spent there is indescribable,” Jeong said.
“When I first came to South Korea and began my life as a resettled defector, I could not sleep at night because I could still see the faces of my fellow inmates at Yodok.”
In 2009, Jeong began to send outside information into his home country. He started off by sending CDs and DVDs, and eventually began sending information through USB flash drives.
“When I myself was living in North Korea, I had no contact with information from outside and I feel that people in North Korea need to know about what is going on outside the country,” Jeong said. “After I came out of North Korea, I saw how important it was to send information.”
Jeong said that the purpose of this information is to create a sense of awareness for the North Korean residents and to educate them on ideas like democracy and freedom.
In response to an audience question about the future of North Korea, Jeong expressed optimism.
“I can’t look into the future, but regarding Kim Jong Un, a regime like that can’t last forever,” Jeong responded. “In due time, I believe that change will happen.”
Julia Rhodes (SFS ’18) said that she was moved by the event.
“I thought the event was particularly powerful because the issue of human rights abuses in North Korea seems almost surreal,” Rhodes said. “It is very grounding to see this story embodied in one single person and I think that it…makes this nightmare seem all the more real.”
Min Joo Lee (SFS ’18) said that the topic of the event was personally relevant to her.
“To us South Koreans, North Koreans are not just anybody. They are actually part of some families who are living in South Korea and are in great pain because of this repressive regime,” Joo Lee said. “This is very personal to me, firstly as a human being, and also as a student who is studying foreign policy. This is what we study for, [and] these are the kind of situations that we want to make better after going through a Georgetown education.”

The panda cub at the National Zoo, who celebrates his one-month birthday today, has grown to more than two pounds and is in good health, on track to be named and revealed to the public in January.
The baby panda was born with a twin Aug. 22. However, the twin, born with respiratory problems, died five days after its birth, despite attempts by handlers to save it. The official cause of death has yet to be determined by the National Zoo.
Pandas are an endangered species, the rarest in the bear family, with only around 1,800 left in the wild.
The surviving cub is slightly over one kilogram, according to a weighing last Thursday.
“He is doing great,” Nicole MacCorkle, a giant panda keeper at the National Zoo, said. “That’s actually a little bit larger than expected, which is a good thing.”
The cub has begun to grow fur, and typical panda markings have started to appear. According to zoo officials, he already exhibits traits resembling both his mother, Mei Xiang, and father, Tian Tian. The next stage in the baby’s development will be the opening of his eyes and ears, which is expected in less than a month’s time.
“He is [growing hair] and his markings are coming in fairly clearly now so he now looks like a little panda,” MacCorkle said. “Things are going to progress pretty quickly.”
At the moment, the baby is trying to push upward with his front legs to get his weight underneath his body, which will allow him to walk.
After the cub begins to become more independent, Mei Xiang will leave the den for more extended periods of time to ease herself back into her old schedule.
“They’re very different creatures, but the mother has to get her schedule in sync with the baby,” MacCorkle said. “Once they’re on more of a routine, she’ll be able to go out of the den for longer periods of time to consume more bamboo because her appetite’s starting to come back.”
The decision to begin showing the pandas to the public will be made by the National Zoo management along with input from keepers, according to MacCorkle. She estimated that showings would not begin until December at the earliest, and would begin in phases, so as to not upset the baby panda.
“This is a busy exhibit in the zoo,” MacCorkle said. “We don’t want to go from having the whole building being quiet to just everybody trying to come in and see this little guy. We’ll ease [him] in.”
MacCorkle said the panda house has become more popular for tourists following the excitement around the baby panda’s birth and subsequent growth. She noted that at the time of the cub’s birth, his older sister Bao Bao was celebrating her second birthday, which also increased attendance.
“There’s always a lot of excitement around [the] panda house, even when there are just adults,” MacCorkle said. “It’s always a busy, bustling place, and even more so with a new cub. … There are a lot of people who are anxious for him to be on exhibit.”
Kate Cole (MSB ’18), president of Animalia, a student group dedicated to ensuring the humane treatment of animals, said that the announcement of the panda’s birth was very exciting, given the difficulties pandas often experience in having children. She said she hopes the baby will inspire the public to learn more about giant pandas.
“I was watching the news and they said they were born and I was very excited,” Cole said. “I know that this is a rarity, a real miracle. Whenever they announce that it will be open, [we] will be going. I’ll plan a trip for Animalia.”
MacCorkie said that visitors can visit the baby at the National Zoo until 2019, when due to an agreement with the Chinese government, the panda will be sent back to participate in a breeding program to help preserve the giant panda species.
“It is sad to see them go to China,” MacCorkle said. “But their big role is to get to save the species. That’s what they get to do, that’s their contribution.”
The Georgetown International Relations Club could not be reached for comment about panda diplomacy.
Maureen Berry (NHS ’18) said that the news of the panda’s birth has made her want to visit the National Zoo, even though she has not kept up to date with the pandas.
“I haven’t followed [news] about the pandas,” Berry said. “But, yeah, I’ll visit the zoo. Who doesn’t love pandas?”

Amid the buzz of the papal visit, The Hoya sat down with University President John J. DeGioia Thursday to discuss Georgetown’s Jesuit identity, DeGioia’s personal connection to his faith and a variety of campus issues including construction, sexual assault and sustainability.
How do you feel about Pope Francis’ visit to D.C. and why do you think it’s significant that he chose the District? 
I’ve said in recent conversations with family and friends that in all the years that I’ve been living here in Washington, which goes back to the mid-1970s, there have been incredible things that have unfolded here in Washington. Some of the inaugurations have been historic, and they’ve been extraordinary. Lots of other kinds of events have been incredibly memorable, but I don’t know anything that has galvanized the city quite like the visit of this pope. It has been really extraordinary to see. I think it’s a reflection both of the authenticity of the individual, the sheer quality of his character, what he personally embodies. In our tradition we kind of call this a sacramental quality. He is the embodiment of a set of values in such a profound resonance with our university. You can see them in our efforts to try to live out the integrity of our commitment to the values that have animated this place for 226 years. There’s a lot that resonates with his own personal history as a Jesuit, so it has been a pretty special time. I had the privilege yesterday to attend the welcome at the White House and then to go to the Mass at the shrine and so it was very special for me and for my family to be able to have that opportunity. Today, I had a chance to listen and read his remarks before the joint session of Congress and I think his drawing upon the examples of four Americans: Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. as well as Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton was a perfect way of capturing what I think is so distinctive about this individual. He was able to draw from the best of the American experience and tradition, while at the same time finding moral leaders who are capable of serving as exemplars for the best in ourselves.
Are you disappointed that the pope is not coming to campus? Will you get the chance to meet with him?
Many have asked me, “Is he coming? Will he come? Of course he has to come!” We began conversations with Cardinal Wuerl and the archdiocese nearly a year ago once we knew that it was likely that he was going to be coming here. Most importantly, we wanted to ensure that we could be of support in any way possible to the archdioceses for this extraordinary visit. It also became pretty clear very early on that the logistics of this trip would be very, very difficult for him to make his way on this campus, so I’m not surprised. It would have been extraordinary if he could have come to visit here, but I understand why it didn’t happen. I’m just so pleased though that so many members of our community were able to have a chance to be a part of this visit.
I know that although you are the first layperson president of Georgetown, you are deeply religious. Can you tell me a little bit about how being at Georgetown has deepened or affected your faith?
I grew up in a very solid family deeply committed to the Catholic faith, but it was something taken kind of easily, lightly. We said grace before our meals; we went as a family to church on Sunday. I have an uncle, my mom’s brother, who’s a Jesuit who has taught at Jesuit universities his whole career. When I came to Georgetown though, I think I came like many at 18, because this is a great university and it felt like the right place. It was only after time as an undergraduate, as my time here continues, that I realized that one of the reasons that it felt so right to me was because of the profound respect it had for the faith of each member of our community. We just celebrated the life of Rabbi [Harold] White on Sunday and Rabbi White and I were friends for nearly 40 years. He served this community long before I ever got here and it was beautiful to see the community come together in that moment. I had the privilege just a week earlier to celebrate Rosh Hashana with our Jewish community in our celebration of the High Holy Days. I think in the testimonies offered at Rabbi White’s memorial, two of the most beautiful were offered by our Imam and by a Catholic priest. I think the profound respect this university community has always shown to me personally, but also I think it has shown in the full diversity of our community. It shows the importance of faith as a dimension of our lives, which was something that I began to appreciate very early on. Then, a really interesting thing happened while I was here, beginning in the early to mid-1980s. The resources of the tradition that has animated Georgetown, the Jesuit tradition, began to be available in ways that just weren’t accessible to earlier generations and it was because of the work of extraordinary individuals, some of whom are here. They’ve been doing this for many, many years and they’re in their 80s but John O’Malley wrote some of the most important work about the early Jesuits. Howard Grey and Brian McDermon have done extraordinary work in making this spirituality of St. Ignatius available. What I realized rather early on is that we are part of a living, breathing, dynamic tradition and we’re helping to interpret and develop and extend and explain and make it ever more alive in this moment. For us, it’s really finding that combination. We strive to be one of the great universities in the world and we strive to be authentic Catholic and Jesuit and to do so in a way that acknowledges the tensions between trying to get that balance and a profound respect for engaging those tensions and critiquing ourselves in being able to respond to those tensions. The motto of the university, “both into one,” originally comes from Paul’s letter to the Ephesians. We’ve sort of taken a lot of liberty in explaining what “both into one” really means. I think one of the ways it takes meaning in our lifetime is really finding this balance between being a university and being a place that is authentically Catholic and Jesuit and finding a way to really integrate those in a way that enables us to be true to who we are.
How do you think the Pope’s causes — immigration, environmental issues etc. — align with Georgetown’s values? What can we learn from him?
Well, I would say two things. First, we have found incredible validation for the kinds of approaches we’ve taken to some of these issues and an incredible challenge to take whatever we’ve done and make it even that much stronger. Let me give you a couple of examples. So, the encyclical that came out in June, Laudato Si’, the most anticipated encyclical in our lifetime, and he didn’t fail in any way to meet anyone’s expectations.
For Georgetown, we made a decision in 2005 to cut our carbon footprint by 50 percent by 2020, and we’re at 72 percent today. We’ve exceeded all of our expectations. Until we read the encyclical, and when we read the encyclical we realized that one of the terms of engagement when we launched this in 2005 was you were permitted to use renewable energy credits as part of the tools that would enable you to accomplish your goal. Reading the pope’s encyclical, renewable energy credits, that’s not going to work. While they’ve been perfectly appropriate when we started, it’s not perfectly appropriate in 2015. So we’re no longer at 72 percent; we’re below 50 now. So we’re going to double down on our efforts and move the needle ever further. I had the privilege to engage an incredible architect and visionary, Bill McDonough, who wrote a book in 2002 called “Cradle to Cradle.” I engaged Bill, we met in June, the encyclical came out a couple weeks later and I was glad I had already reached out to Bill because it was clear we were going to need to take this further. The pope, in his letter, talks about the circular economy. “Cradle to Cradle” was an early effort to try to show how you might be able to act more circularity in the way in which you organize your lives together in a community. I wasn’t sure if anybody would come because it was early August, but I invited a hundred members of the community to come together for a two-day workshop led by Bill. We broke down into four team categories. We looked at multiple dimensions of the university; many students came back from all over the place just for those two days. Bill introduced the concepts and we had working groups at each table, trying to unpack everything from water to waste to transportation to energy usage and how we engage that. We’ve been working on a number of important fronts. I had signed an agreement for the university some years back in the context of a group I worked with, the Global Economic Forum, the Global University Leaders Forum, where we signed an agreement that committed us to a compact with other global universities to try to address issues of sustainability. Then, we had a leadership effort here in Washington that we were a part of, where the universities of Washington committed to new levels of sustainability. What we hope we can do from a number of initiatives — from the Georgetown Environment Initiative to our work on sustainability to the circular economy — all of these are an effort on our part to try to respond to this challenge.
Recently, the Association of American Universities found that 23 percent of women reported being sexually assaulted in college. Can you evaluate the problem of sexual assault at Georgetown? 
I would begin with the priorities, which is to ensure that this is the safest possible place for students and that no one be blocked, limited in any way by a fear that this wasn’t a place that provided the strongest possible context for them to live their richest possible life here. The degree to which concerns about sexual assault are blocking, limiting any of our members from being able to realize a full experience here, that is always our first priority. I’ve had an opportunity to work on these questions for nearly a quarter century because at one point in my years here at Georgetown, I was the Chief Student Affairs Officer — the Dean of Students — from ’85 to ’92 and in that context we confronted these dynamics in a very direct way. We established a framework that included a personnel and sexual assault working group. We’ve had a deep history and deep engagement in trying to ensure the safest possible environment for our community. At the same time, we recognize that in any context like this, you have to just stay at it, keep working, try to find the next way we can deepen and engage with our students where they are so that we can be supportive in the most appropriate ways. For structure, we can provide leadership, wherever it’s possible for us to do, and whenever it’s possible to provide, we’re doing it. We share all these responsibilities because all students have to live out their own lives to ensure that they understand both what we expect and what we believe are the appropriate standards for behavior here, and that we’re prepared to provide a framework to support and sustain that. And if there are things that only a university can do, we want to make sure we’re doing those. It’s been about three years now we’ve had the online program that was part of orienting everyone to our community, two years now we’ve been a leader in modeling best practice regarding bystander training and awareness. We just entered into a new agreement with our students. It is great leadership from Georgetown University Student Association and by our colleagues. It’s a terrific piece of work. We added the online app last year, which I think was received well. We’ve developed a new training program for all those who were involved in hearings. We critique and receive critique following some of the hearings. We’ve also been participating in some of the national and local discussion. I was part of a meeting here in Washington in August. We are very aware of how important this issue is right now, what an appropriate kind of understanding and responsibility it entails, and we’re trying to ensure we’re doing everything in our power to respond to those expectations.
We recently completed the capital campaign early. What do you think that says about the university and its alums? Georgetown is still ranked #21 in the U.S. News & World Report rankings, despite our low endowment. What does that mean, to you?
We’re going to work all year to try to achieve even more. We did accomplish the target goal of $1.5 billion, and you’re quite right that the rankings in U.S. News put a disproportionate amount of attention on endowment. And the history for Georgetown is we were actually owned by a religious community, the Jesuits of Georgetown until 1969, and we didn’t begin fundraising like traditional universities until the early 1980s. We’ve done four campaigns in our modern history. We’ve raised roughly $2 billion since I took on this role. My experience has been with incredibly broad and deep generosity in our community. I think, relative to our peers, we’re doing relatively well. In terms of the growth rate, to raise $2 billion in this last decade, that’s a pretty good tribute to this community. It is completely predicated on generosity. We wanted to raise $1.5 billion; we wanted $100 million for financial aid. This is a deeply committed community, and for me it’s a privilege to engage with it in this way. These are folks who believe in us; they believe in our values, they believe in our mission, they believe in our history, and most importantly, they believe in our future.
There’s always things you are raising for: financial aid, faculty and infrastructure. In this case, we organized the campaign around four priorities: financial aid, faculty, infrastructure and what we call transformative opportunities. If you think about the first one, scholarship support, I would say that that enables us to ensure that the next generation of the best students will always be able to consider Georgetown as a realistic opportunity. Our way of ensuring the future of the institution and the quality of the student body is to ensure our affordability. The way we ensure affordability is through two policies: need-blind in admission and we meet full need of all of our students. What does that mean? We don’t believe that your ability to pay is a relevant factor in our decision to admit you. When we construct a class, when Charlie Deacon and our committees on admissions construct a class, we think they should look at a number of things about you, in determining admission. We don’t think one of them is your ability to pay.
Number two, when we say faculty, it is normally the programs faculty are interested in. Right now, there are number of issues that are of real concern from a faculty perspective that need to be a part of our agenda. The campaign enables us to ensure we have the resources to adapt accordingly. For example in the last decade, China has emerged as more important. How have we responded? Victor Cha created an incredible program in the School of Foreign Service around Asian studies. We’ve put an office in Beijing. We’ve facilitated a lot more flow of ideas and talent between and China and Georgetown. We wouldn’t have been able to do that without philanthropy. We’ve launched some really exciting and incredible projects, the most important I think in this context being Designing the Future(s). Designing the Future(s) is identifying a number of ways in which we might be able to adapt and move forward as an institution. But we need to be able to do so in a way in which we’re very cognizant of the cost. So if cost weren’t an object, we’d be doing all sorts of other things around here, but we want to always try to ensure affordability. So finding that right balance, and what Designing the Future(s) is doing is looking at both exciting new adventures for us in learning, and how might we able to restrain, constrain the growth in cost.
How is current campus construction going, and how does it fit in to your future vision for the university?
We’ve done one billion over the last 14 years here on campus. We needed to, in terms of the constraints of the neighborhood community, in order to move forward in the growth and development that we needed to, and when we launched the Southwest Quadrangle project, that was a prerequisite for us to do the things we needed to do, which was we needed a new home for business, for performing arts, for science. We were able to ultimately get that done. What enabled us to do the billion plus was the great generosity of our community. The really annoying stuff, I think will be done by Thanksgiving; the library walk, the Quadrangle, the new bus turnaround facility down near McDonough Gym, these have been the most annoying of the projects and I think we’re going to have those finished this fall. That leaves the two big projects, which is the Thompson Center and the new residence hall next to Reiss. I think those are on track to be finished by early summer of next year. We may get a window there where there won’t be a towering crane on campus for the first time in 15 or 16 years. We’ll miss the towering crane, but we won’t miss the disruptions.
I know that you’re in the process of developing the newest campus plan with the neighborhood – how are the deliberations going and how much is the university willing to compromise with students and the neighborhood?
Our goal is always to just stay at the table, and keep working until we get an alignment between what we need. “We” is a complicated “we”. Our faculty have interests, our students have interests, our alumni have interests, and as an administration we seek to create the best possible balance for our own perspective. And then we bring it out to the public, and we have multiple neighborhoods. When we established the Georgetown Community Partnership, that gave us the most stable and consistent way of providing continuity over time in this conversation. We don’t have a lot more that we can do on this campus, we know our limits, there aren’t that many more places that we can build. Our ambition for this campus is not unreasonable. I think we’re realistic about what more can be done here. I think we’re going to have the ability to get alignment with our students, our faculty and our alumni in terms of this campus. I don’t think people want to see a whole lot more construction around here; we know we can do some work. Lauinger, I think would be well-received by many, a bit next to Regents Hall. And the long-range dream of flipping the Yates Field and Shaw Field, where Shaw Field could go on Yates and Yates could go on Shaw Field. That’s probably the longest-range. And the most immediate issue is really around academic medicine. MedStar Health is ready to build a new hospital, and we are ready to support them and the site for that is the parking lot between Darnall and the existing hospital. That would be worth taking a look at, a very exciting project, we’re very supportive of MedStar’s interest in getting that done. I think that will help our medical students and our residents really be able to move forward in this new way. That one is ambitious, a big, big project that we all need to get everybody in alignment regarding that. I’m pretty confident we’re going to be able to get alignment between all of the parties, because I think our expectations are reasonable and modest, and I think we just need to make sure that everybody is a part of it.
The construction going on around campus has made it quite difficult for disabled students to navigate campus? Do you plan to address their needs in the future?
I think truly it’s unintentional; there’s no excuse for not being able to accommodate. We know what our responsibilities are to respect a number of our community, ensure we are attentive to that.

Former Secretary of Defense and School of Foreign Service professor Chuck Hagel will return to Georgetown as a distinguished executive-in-residence this academic year.
In his new position, Hagel will provide support and expertise to all four schools of the university and give guest lectures.
In a statement on the university website released last Thursday, Hagel said he is excited to become involved in education again after two years as secretary of defense.
“I’m looking forward to renewing my association with Georgetown and helping a great institution continue its important work preparing our next generation of leaders,” Hagel wrote.
According to Office of the President Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara, Hagel has visited campus and is in the process of meeting with deans, administrators and professors, including SFS Dean Joel Hellman and McCourt School of Public Policy Dean Edward Montgomery, to determine the best ways to address their schools’ specific needs.
“What he’s doing now as the semester is getting underway is he’s talking to deans … and saying … ‘Tell me what you’ve got going; where could I be helpful?’” Ferrara said.
Although no events or guest lectures have yet been planned, Hellman said he hopes that Hagel will be a valuable resource for students and faculty in a variety of ways.
“Our hope from the SFS side is to use Secretary Hagel across the program,” Hellman said. “He’s going to be providing guest lectures and engaging across our program where his experience is going to be most useful. He’ll also help us [think] through how to establish practical engagement exercises for our students and bringing his experience into some of that practical experience.”
Prior to his nomination as secretary of defense, Hagel taught several courses on geopolitics, such as a course called “Redefining Geopolitical Relationships,” in the SFS from 2009 to 2013.
Michael Podberezin (GRD ’14), who took Hagel’s course, “21st Century Geopolitical Realities,” said in a statement on the Georgetown website that Hagel incorporated his practical experience into his courses.
“The fact that Sen. Hagel was in the room when many of the decisions were made really creates a unique learning opportunity,” Podberezin said.
Hagel served as the secretary of defense under President Barack Obama from February 2013 to this February, when he resigned under pressure from the administration.
Under his term as secretary of defense, Hagel was faced with multiple international conflicts, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the increasing territorial gain of the Islamic State and a continued delay in closing the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
He previously represented Nebraska as the state’s first Republican senator in 24 years from 1997 to 2009, and is noted as the first veteran of the Vietnam War to serve as secretary of defense. He received two Purple Hearts for his service.
During his term as senator, Hagel served as a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations, Banking and Intelligence Committees. He also chaired the Senate Global Climate Change Observer Group and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.
Hellman said that he hopes Hagel will be an accessible resource for a wide range of interested students.
“We’d really like to keep the maximum flexibility for him as a resource, so he’s someone who is available to meet with faculty [and] students [and] engage with them on their classes rather than target one audience or one group of students,” Hellman said.
Previous executives in residence include former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Robert Mueller, who took on the position in late 2013 a week after he resigned from the FBI.
Ferrara said that Hagel’s renewed involvement will be beneficial to the Georgetown community.
“He very much enjoys being part of the Georgetown community. He was very interested in having an affiliation here after stepping down as Secretary of Defense, and so he plans to be on campus as much as he possibly can,” Ferrara said. “He’s someone who feels an attachment to the Georgetown community and wants to contribute.”
Halle Hagan (SFS ’18) said that she looks forward to broadening her understanding of international affairs from attending Hagel’s lectures.
“I’m sure that Secretary Hagel’s guest lectures will add fresh insight into international affairs today,” Hagan said. “I hope that I will have the opportunity to attend one of his lectures in my remaining years at Georgetown.”
The Hoya has reached out to Hagel for a Q&A.

Georgetown and Google co-hosted Secretary of State John Kerry’s Climate and Clean Energy Investment Forum on Oct. 20 and 21, gathering federal officials and executives from both the public and private sectors to discuss clean energy initiatives nationwide.
Conference highlights included a fireside chat between Kerry and University President John J. DeGioia at the State Department on Tuesday and a keynote address from Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz in Lohrfink Auditorium at the McDonough School of Business on Wednesday.
Kerry opened the two-day forum with remarks Tuesday morning, citing examples of climate change, including that 19 of the hottest 20 years in history have occurred in the past two decades. He called on participants to use the forum to collaborate and think of long-term solutions.
“The solution to this particular challenge — climate change — is actually just as simple as the realization that it is the challenge that it is,” Kerry said. “We have investment leaders here today, representing trillions of dollars of assets under management, focused, not on abstract discussions, but on real, tangible initiatives that will actually bring about a clean and sustainable future.”
Kerry spoke about the United Nations Climate Change Conference that will be held in Paris this December as a goal for international progress.
“The road through Paris is paved with investment decisions that you’re going to make not tomorrow, but today,” Kerry said. “The good news is that even as we get a better and better understanding of the dangers of our carbon-based economy, we are also getting a better understanding of the many ways we can improve in the ways we power our world.”
Throughout his speech, Kerry continually stressed the economic benefits of addressing climate change.
“The real kicker is that innovations in clean energy and energy efficiency is that they don’t just stave off the worst impacts of climate change. They’re also going to grow our economies and employ our communities,” Kerry said.
Following Kerry’s introduction, NBC News Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent Andrea Mitchell moderated a fireside chat with Kerry, DeGioia and Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment Co-Chair Jeremy Grantham.
Mitchell specifically asked DeGioia about the impact of Pope Francis’ June encyclical on the university’s efforts in the area of climate change.
“It did not disappoint. It truly was an extraordinary moment and had served already to inspire us to try to determine how could we, as a university community, respond differently in this moment,” DeGioia said. “Any time we get a little bit self-satisfied or complacent, we just have to take a look at that encyclical and realize there is a significant gap between our current reality, the way we are living, and what he is asking us to do.”
DeGioia spoke primarily about the university’s academic approach, referencing the Global Social Enterprise Initiative and the Georgetown University Law Center’s Georgetown Climate Center.
DeGioia cited the Georgetown Environment Initiative as a main factor of the university’s efforts since its November 2012 launch. Funded by a $20 million anonymous donation, the initiative encourages environmental study across Georgetown’s main, medical and law campuses.
“What we’ve tried to do with the Georgetown Environment Initiative … was harness the power of our institution to look at the integration of policy, law, business, science and try to make the kinds of contributions that universities can make to this dialogue,” DeGioia said.
In his keynote address, Moniz echoed Kerry’s emphasis on the upcoming Paris conference. He cited the recent climate deal between the United States and China as evidence that upcoming conference will result in positive progress.
“I do think it’s fair to say that the optimism of our accomplishing something substantial in Paris is significantly greater than it was a year ago,” Moniz said.
Additionally, Moniz touched on both the short-term and long-term goals for effective climate action.
“We will have to keep squeezing down on carbon emissions, on greenhouse gas emissions in general,” Moniz said. “And that’s the time period where a word I will use a lot today, innovation, is going to be absolutely central to meeting not just long-term goals, 10 or 15 years, but also continuing progress that we will need to make beyond that.”
He specifically referenced the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy that promotes and funds renewable energy and green technologies and spoke about the department’s broad approach to finding clean energy options.
“Our view has been called ‘all of the above.’ Our view is, the goal is low carbon in the energy sector. We believe that there is not one low-carbon solution,” Moniz said. “So what we believe is that our job is to enable any approach to low carbon to compete for a place in the marketplace.”
Moniz concluded the address emphasizing that Paris was not the end point for seeking new, environmentally secure energy solutions.
“So those are some of the things on our minds as we are heading into Paris,” Moniz said. “But, as you can see, we will be really thinking hard about the path from Paris, which is when we really have to work hard to meet our goals in 2025 and beyond.”

The Georgetown University Law Center and HEC Paris have partnered to create two dual degrees — a Master of Business Administration/Master of Laws and a Grande Ecole Master in Management/Master of Laws — with the first incoming class to begin fall 2016 and graduate in spring 2017.
The degrees were created in response to discussions among professors, students and the Alumni Board. Primary facilitators of the program include GULC adjunct professor Alberto Alemanno, HEC professor Dorothy Mayer and Chair of the European Alumni Board Delphine Addlard.
After initial discussions, the European Alumni Board formally presented the idea to GULC.
GULC Dean William Treanor said the creation of these mixed business and law degrees came as a response to increased interest in programs that combine the two fields.
“At a time in which so much business practice and so much legal practice is global, you’re getting a U.S. LL.M. from a great American law school and an MBA from a top French business school,” Treanor said. “You’re very prepared for a global business practice and a global legal practice. … I think it’s going to be very powerful and very appealing.”
Students will spend the first year studying at HEC Paris, ranked the No. 2 business school in Europe by the Financial Times in 2014, studying core degree requirements. The second and final year for both programs will be completed on GULC’s campus and include more specified curriculums.
“The first year is the general year. So, you would typically do quantitative methods and statistics and organizational behavior,” Treanor said. “The second year, the year in which you specialize, rather than taking some specialized courses at HEC, you’re taking legal studies at Georgetown. So it’s essentially, the year of legal study at Georgetown substitutes for the year of specialization at HEC.”
The MBA/LL.M. program requires students already have a law degree and at least three years of professional experience, while applicants interested in the MiM/LL.M. program must already have a bachelor’s degree in law. Both programs require applicants are fluent in English.
Assistant Dean of Graduate Programs Caryn Voland explained the standards for language and experience that will determine admission to the program.
“We will be looking for people that have done well academically,” Voland said. “They will need to show language fluency at the same level we require of all of our students which is generally a full score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language. … So, strong academic background, professional is required for the MBA and English fluency.”
Voland also emphasized the degrees as a way for graduates to distinguish themselves in the competitive legal industry.
“There are some law firms that send their associates to be trained with an LL.M. in the U.S. because they want more business-savvy lawyers,” Voland said. “All over the world, lawyers are looking to become more competitive and distinguish themselves, so I think that this is an opportunity if they want to show their commitment and understanding of business concepts.”
The degrees do not incur any extra charge or financial change, since students pay HEC Paris tuition for their first year and Georgetown fees for their second one.
Georgetown also offers dual degrees with Tsinghua University in China and provides study abroad opportunities in various universities, including Yonsei Law School in South Korea, Amsterdam Law School, Keio Law School in Japan and ESADE Law School in Spain. Georgetown’s dual-degree program with Sciences Po in Paris for a master’s of international affairs served as model for the HEC collaboration, according to Voland.
Additionally, Treanor indicated that the GULC is interested in expanding its current dual degree offerings.
“We’re actually in the process of looking at other schools around the world that have similar dual degree programs,” Treanor said. “We’re open to expanding this structure.”
HEC Paris Director for International Affairs François Collin also highlighted the dual degree as an opportunity for both the universities and the students to expand their perspectives.
“Students come to HEC with a variety of academic backgrounds, and we look forward to expanding the number of lawyers who will bring their previous legal experiences and perspectives to their study of business here,” Collin said in a GULC press release.

Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Prasad Kariyawasam expressed his optimism for political and economic reform in his country at a speech in the Intercultural Center on Wednesday night.
The event, titled “Sri Lanka: A Tale of a Resilient Democracy,” was organized by the Asian Pacific Forum and the Asian Studies Program.
Asian Studies professor Irfan Nooruddin, who moderated the event, said that Kariyawasam’s speech is an example of the School of Foreign Service’s growing interest in the South Asian region.
“[The visit] is part of a broader agenda to build the presence of South Asia in the SFS,” Nooruddin said. “Some say South Asia has been neglected in most conversations. … But the ambassador’s visit is a step in the right direction to bringing its issues and importance to the forefront of discussion.”
Kariyawasam served as Sri Lanka’s diplomat to India, Saudi Arabia and Switzerland before becoming ambassador to the United States. Throughout the discussion, he provided examples from his political career to explore a wide variety of topics.
Kariyawasam began by stressing the importance of democratization in Sri Lanka.
“Democracy is a work in progress, and it was hard to say our government was democratic,” Kariyawasam said. “Sri Lankans decided … to go through with a free and fair election, and the democratic institutions were strengthened.”
Sri Lanka, which gained its independence in 1948 after 150 years of British rule, is the oldest democracy in Asia. Since it became independent, the country endured a 25-year civil war between the government and minority ethnic groups.
Kariyawasam said that although the conflict ended in 2009, the government still faces significant challenges in overcoming its history of oppression.
“[The] last government was authoritarian and operated with impunity,” Nooruddin said. “Yet the mood has moved from pessimism to optimism with the revitalization of democratic principles. Sri Lanka is once again a bright spot for democracies.”
As the conversation progressed, Kariyawasam addressed Sri Lanka’s improving relationship with the United States. In September, both countries agreed to draft a resolution that would focus on post-civil war reconciliation efforts in Sri Lanka.
However, the ambassador said that the relationship between the two nations has not always been favorable.
“There were many areas of dissonance in the relationship, especially in the areas of human rights,” Kariyawasam said. “Since the elections, we are increasingly on the same page.”
Kariyawasam said that Sri Lanka is also positioning itself to continue strong economic growth. The country’s gross domestic product growth rate has remained above 6.5 percent since 2009, a higher rate than those of India and Pakistan.
According to Kariyawasam, the Sri Lanka’s positioning as a trade hub is important to its economic prosperity and international relationships. Seventy percent of the world’s oil passes through the region, providing incentive for Sri Lanka, India and China to strengthen their relations.
“We are in the intersection of a power play with world commerce and world powers,” Kariyawasam said. “Our partnerships and the liberalizations of our economy will only allow for further prosperity.”
Amanda Zhu (MSB ’17) said she was unaware of the country’s recent social, political and economic progress prior to Kariyawasam’s speech.
“Sri Lanka is usually talked about tangentially in relationship to China and India,” Zhu said. “But people should be paying attention to it more. The shift into a more democratic government is a success story, but so are its economic and political developments. Its regional importance will only expand.”
Yohan Senarath (SFS ’17), a student in the Asian Studies Program, said Kariyawasam is one of the most effective political operators and commentators in Sri Lanka.
“I find him to be an oxymoron in the world of diplomacy. He is genuine, insightful and incisive when it comes to providing sharp analysis on the relevant issues,” Senarath said. “These qualities are what make the ambassador one of the most respected diplomats working today.”
Senarath said that he hoped the conversation will change commonly held perceptions about Sri Lanka.
“Most Americans consider Sri Lanka a noteworthy country, but not at the level of importance that is shared by actual policymakers,” Senarath said. “You are only likely to see the nation feature more prominently as future issues centered within the region continue to play out.”

PARIS – Le Bourget, the location of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, was surprisingly far from the center of Paris. Conference-goers got off in the periphery of the metro at Fort d’Aubervilliers before taking a shuttle ride that offered views of the fairly drab suburb of Le Bourget, filled with plain storefronts and often-dilapidated apartment buildings. It did not seem like the kind of place the entire world would be watching.
I chose the second week of negotiations to visit the conference to attend an event hosted by Georgetown, a panel discussion titled “The Subnational (State and Provincial) Foundation for Action.” The other three events hosted by Georgetown officials were titled “Challenges and Opportunities in China-U.S. Cooperation on Energy and Climate Change,” “Subnational Cooperation on Clean, Resilient Transportation” and “U.S. State Actions to Achieve Significant GHG Reduction.”
By the time I attended the conference, the overwhelming security-presence brouhaha that surrounded the arrival of 150 heads of state in France had subsided, and entering the Climate Generations space, located behind the main negotiations area, involved nothing more than a straightforward security check. The space, intended for civil society and open to the public, aimed to drive dialogue about climate change between ordinary citizens, nongovernmental organizations and policymakers.
Three sections of the giant tent were designated for stalls operated by NGOs and cities to inform the public on particular initiatives, including everything from the basics of recycling to the intersection of poverty and the environment. Ten conference rooms in another section hosted panel discussions throughout the day, while a projection room screened environmental documentaries.
The panel I attended was a dialogue on subnational efforts by American states and Canadian provinces to combat climate change. It featured Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin, Manitoba Premier Gregory Selinger and senior officials from Quebec, California and Washington state.
Georgetown Climate Center Executive Director Vicki Arroyo moderated the event. The Climate Center is an affiliate of the Georgetown Law Center that collaborates with the federal government to coordinate state policies around the country.
As the Climate Center works closely with state and provincial governments, Arroyo highlighted the outsized impact of subnational actors on the fight against climate change.
“They’re not subnational, they’re super-national,” Arroyo said at the panel.
Shumlin credited the Climate Center with bringing these various actors together.
“We were all working too hard to think about working together,” Shumlin said. “We would not be working together without Vicki and her team at Georgetown.”
Establishing a theme that other panelists would also emphasize, Shumlin pointed to transportation as a primary area of action, noting the importance of the Climate Center’s Transportation and Climate Initiative in designing improvements to electric vehicle infrastructure.
Selinger expanded on Shumlin’s remarks, explaining the importance of state-level focus.
“Every jurisdiction has its own challenges,” Selinger said.
Yet the panelists also acknowledged the interconnectedness of issues across borders. Quebec Environmental Minister David Heurtel said that his province had just established a sub-national $25.5 million Solidarity Fund to invest in developing countries, the first of its kind.
“We have a responsibility worldwide as well,” Heurtel said.
Quebec and California have also teamed up to implement a cooperative cap-and-trade system, a partnership which California Environmental Protection Agency Secretary Matt Rodriquez said developed naturally.
“I thought I’d just be focused on California throughout my time as secretary, but a number of other governments around the world were interested in what we were doing,” Rodriquez said.
Sarah Rees, special assistant to the director for climate policy at the Washington State Department of Ecology, underlined the urgency of action now and presented worrying signs of advancing climate change in Washington.
“We need to go a bit further,” Rees said. “With people seeing these effects firsthand, I’m hopeful we can change the political dynamic.”
However, protestors constantly interrupted the discussion. During Shumlin’s remarks, a man stood up and began singing, while two women held up a sign reading “Fracked Gas = Climate Change.” Rees and Rodriquez were interrupted as well, with protestors reading statements greeted with loud applause from other protestors and quiet exasperation from audience members.
As the question-and-answer portion of the event concluded, Arroyo made a final plea.
“I care deeply about these issues, and I’ve devoted my life to working on them. When I was your age, I protested too, but I was respectful when I did it,” Arroyo said. “You’re protesting the wrong people.”
However, the loud activism during the panel contrasted with the rest of the civil-society space. As I strolled through the center, I repeatedly heard “I don’t know,” and “This is incredibly complicated,” but I also heard, “This might help.” These phrases seem to encapsulate the tension at the heart of the conference. The negotiations were undoubtedly complicated; countries around the world are divided, primarily between developed and developing nations. But they are also searching for some way to address a crucial issue, one that, according to President Barack Obama, “affects all trends.”
The vibrancy of the civil-society space seemed to draw energy from the focus on that central issue. Even despite the contentiousness of the panel I attended, one moment during Selinger’s speech highlighted this common unity against climate change.
“This is one of the defining issues of our time,” Selinger said. “It inspires us. It inspires the protestors, as well. We may come at it from different angles, but we all are working to figure out a way to ensure sustainable development and to save the environment.”

José Miguel Luna (SFS ’15) has been selected as a member of the first class of Schwarzman Scholars, a program that will send 111 students from 35 countries to pursue a Masters degree in either public policy, economics and business or international studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.
The program, which was founded by Stephen Schwarzman, Chairman, CEO and Co-founder of Blackstone asset management and advisory firm with an initial $100 million endowment, offers scholars from around the world the opportunity to study for a year at one of the top-ranked schools in China.
While at Tsinghua University, Schwarzman scholars pursue a core curriculum through the winter, followed by study in concentrations of economics and business, public policy or international studies. The scholars are also expected to have internships in the spring and opportunities for travel.
Luna’s pursuit of the program was the result of both his desire to learn more about China, a region he studied greatly while at Georgetown, as well as coincidence.
“The program fit my interests really well, almost unbelievably well,” Luna said. “I didn’t know about this program, it wasn’t like I was planning this program for a while … I got the email, I thought it was incredible [so] I did some more reading.”
While abroad, Luna hopes to form a deeper understanding of China’s role in the world.
“I really want to use this year to get a more concrete idea of how China is going to continue to become such a key player specifically in international economics, trade and finance,” Luna said.
While at Georgetown, Luna was founder and president of the Mexican Student Association and was a general manager at Hoya Snaxa. He graduated with a major in International Economics with a concentration in International Finance and Commerce and a certificate in International Development.
Assistant dean in the School of Foreign Service Polly Robey wrote in an email to The Hoya that Luna has the character traits necessary to be a successful scholar.
“José has such a wonderful and warm personality and he is the kind of person that inspires others to get involved and do great things. I have no doubt that he will represent Georgetown extremely well,” Robey wrote.
According to Global Admissions Director for the Schwarzman Scholars Robert Garris, the program was created with the intention of developing leaders with a better understanding of China.
“Steve Schwarzman, when he created the program really had the ambition of building over time a global network of people who are in leadership roles in business and government and the non-profit sector who are more effective at their work because they have a deeper understanding of China,” Garris said.
Applicants from around the world must submit a written application and semi-finalists must attend an interview with politicians, businesspeople and academics. This year, internationally renowned figures such as General David Petraeus, the former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, participated in certain interviews.
This year the program received 3054 applications and interviewed 300 applicants, before selecting the final 111 scholars.
The program has a 3.7 percent acceptance rate. The Rhodes Scholarship has a .4 percent acceptance rate, while the Marshall Scholarship has a 3.4 percent acceptance rate.
Garris said that the program hopes to develop the same level of prestige as the Rhodes Scholarship.
“I think everyone or almost everyone is aware that Bill Clinton for example is a Rhodes Scholar and we hope that in some point in the future a Prime Minister of Brazil or Thailand or Japan or a President of the United States was a Schwarzman Scholar and everyone points that out,” Garris said.
According to Luna, the Schwarzman Scholars will not only help the scholars who participate, but it will also help improve relations between China and the rest of the world.
“If you take a step back it’s a big necessary process in my opinion for the substantial and thorough forging of the relationship between China and the US, and really China and the rest of the world in general because it’s a global program,” Luna said.

Georgetown University received a $10 million donation from Hong Kong-based multinational conglomerate Spring Breeze Foundation to establish an Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues, announced Jan. 14.
The donation, which will be parceled out at $1 million per year over 10 years, funds research, teaching and outreach that span five global issues: peace and security, business and trade, economic and social development, global health and humanitarian crises and the environment.
The university has previously facilitated academic exchange with China through partnerships with Chinese institutions including the Central Party School in Beijing and Fudan University in Shanghai.
Vice President of Global Affairs Thomas Banchoff said Georgetown’s academic background in and relationship with China were factors that compelled the Spring Breeze Foundation to impart the gift.
“The Foundation reached out to Georgetown because we are a leading university in Washington, D.C., and have interdisciplinary expertise around global issues as well as strong connections in China,” Banchoff wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Core Initiative’s programs, including the research groups and student-student dialogue, will be designed to build and share knowledge on critical issues.”
The Charoen Pokphand Group, a leading Thai agro-industry and retail conglomerate, created The Spring Breeze Foundation in 2015. The CP Group supports academic institutions that research global development. The Group has previously donated to Harvard, Pennsylvania State, Duke and Tsinghua universities.
Shang Zhang (GRD ’11), an investment manager for CP Group’s subsidiary CT Bright Holdings, emphasized the initiative as a way to strengthen relationships between American and Asian institutions.
“As a global corporation with a large presence in [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] and China, the CP group has a social responsibility and willingness to contribute to stronger East-West ties,” Zhang wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown University was selected for its academic excellence, independence and potential role in enhancing high-level dialogue and cultural exchange between the East and West.”
While still in its planning stage, the initiative has assembled a 14- person faculty committee, comprised of scholars from across the Georgetown schools, to formulate its programming. The committee is currently recruiting a director and staff for the initiative, including a senior China scholar and a junior hire focused more broadly on Asia.
Some of the plans are expected to take effect this semester, including the launch of a website scheduled for next month and the formation of research groups which will publish their findings, organize seminars and consult with policymakers. Others, including the linkage of Georgetown classes with courses taught in China through videoconferencing technology planned for the fall semester, are operating on a longer time frame.
Professor Michael Green, who previously served as a senior Asia expert on the National Security staff and now is on the initiative committee, said the committee aims to establish a dialogue unencumbered by the bureaucracy which often dogs official government channels, and fosters mutual trust that does not compromise U.S. or ally interests.
“We’re well-positioned to have a candid dialogue about comprehensive issues and we’re still designing what that dialogue will include,” Green said. “I should emphasize that this is not based on the idea that we should sweep our differences under the rug or that we should ignore the interests of our allies in Asia. … Georgetown has done that on some of our most sensitive issues in a very productive way that has built more trust, not less.”
Green said that a donation from the corporate foundation will not infringe upon the autonomy of the university’s research, as Georgetown will independently decide how the money will be spent. Rather, the programming will revolve around four foundational principles: independence, transparency, balance and academic excellence.
“In any gift, it’s incumbent upon the university, whether a university or a think tank, to ensure academic independence,” Green said. “The donors understood that … we would define the mission of this dialogue, but we would do so based on participation from the U.S. side that is unhindered and unobstructed in any way.”
Alex Rued (GRD ’16), editor-in-chief of The Georgetown Journal of Asian Affairs and a graduate student in Georgetown’s Asian Studies program, said she hopes for a greater degree of people-to-people exchange as a result of the new initiative.
“I think it might also be helpful that there be some involvement with the Journal where we could publish some young scholars from China on issues and maybe have debates on issues that the U.S. or China are facing to get dialogue where we’re not seeing much improvement at the high levels of government,” Rued said.
Anna Scott Bell (GRD ’16), who also studies politics and security in China in the Asian Studies program, said she hopes the donation will provide insight into more morally ambiguous topics.
“I think so much about the conversation about the U.S.-China relationship is understandably focused on business and security, but in many ways I’d like to see that we broaden the conversation,” Bell said. “Some of the areas that are really difficult to get past in the U.S.-China relationships are more values-based or human rights-based, issues about the different types of governance and free speech and civil society that we need to focus research on rather than make them more peripheral or marginal.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article indicated that Bell was an employee of the Congressional Executive Commission on China and was speaking on behalf of CECC. She is an intern and is not professionally affiliated with CECC.

The Smithsonian National Zoo welcomed three new pandas these past several months and has slowly begun to introduce them to the public on public-viewing days.
Rusty, a male red panda famous for his temporary escape in 2013, and his two cubs are thriving at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. Along with their father, the one-year-old cubs, Tusa and Asa, join fellow red pandas on the red list of endangered species, meaning there are fewer than 10,000 of them left in the wild.
The third panda, Bei Bei, sparked the public’s interest with his birth five months ago on Aug. 22.
On Bei Bei’s public-viewing day on Jan. 16, 10,000 visitors entered the zoo and 7,000 of them visited the panda exhibit, a greater amount than for Bei Bei’s older sister Bao Bao in January 2014. The general public was able to watch Bei Bei’s growth through an online camera before his debut.
Currently, the Smithsonian Zoo is home to four giant pandas: Tian Tian, his mother Mei Xiang and their daughter Bao Bao, and Bei Bei. Tai Shan, their firstborn, was sent back to China in 2010.
In the public viewings thus far, Bei Bei, whose name means precious treasure in Chinese, has developed a reputation for being rather sleepy, which he proved by sleeping through his media checkup.
Bei Bei has also been quite popular in the media, with articles featuring him published in several newspapers, including The New York Times and The Washington Post, in addition to blogs and videos dedicated to him. First Lady Michelle Obama and China’s first lady Peng Liyuan have both visited him.
Spokeswoman for the zoo Devin Murphy said that Bei Bei’s popularity is likely due to the relationship the public has maintained with him since his birth.
“The public has been able to watch Bei Bei since the moment he was born through the panda cam and that’s why they feel very attached to him,” Murphy said. “And they’ve been able to see exactly what we’re seeing.”
Pandas are an endangered species with only 1,800 left in the wild and have a notoriously difficult time reproducing. Mother pandas give birth to twins 50 percent of the time but in the wild, the mother can only take care of one, often causing the other to die.
Bei Bei, was a result of artificial insemination. However, his sibling died at four days old. Although Mei Xiang, their mother, began nursing both cubs, she had difficulty caring for the both of them. The zoo swapped the babies until Mei Xiang rejected the weaker one, allowing it to bottle-feed him.
A pathology report attributed Bei Bei’s brother’s death to an aspiration of food in his respiratory system, resulting in pneumonia and eventually death.
Murphy said that zoo staff tailored its care for Bei Bei and Bao Bao according to indications it receive sfrom Mei Xiang.
“Really, Mei Xiang has raised both of her cubs, so we take all of our cues from her and she is an excellent mom. And based on what she’s telling us, we move at her pace,” Murphy said. “We’ve done things very similarly with Bei Bei and Bao Bao.”
The Smithsonian will have the pandas until 2020, when the lease expires. Bei Bei will only be here for the first four years of his life before he joins his older sister in China. The cubs are transferred in order to aid the process of creating more pandas and generating research on the species.
For now, Bei Bei is in good health and is expected to continue to grow. Murphy is looking forward to Bei Bei’s development.
“We expect his climbing skills to get a little better,” Murphy said. “He’s probably going to work on perfecting them over the next couple of months. He’s probably going to start eating bamboo around six months of age so he’s going to be nursing from his mom for at least another year.”
Murphy added that as people continue to visit him, visitors will be able to see the changes in Bei Bei over time as he grows and thrives with his family.
“He’s going to be changing week by week so if you visit multiple times, you’re likely to see something different every time,” Murphy said.
David Harris, a zoo visitor who went to the general public viewing, had yet to visit the zoo before attending Bei Bei’s debut.
“We came to visit family and meet family for our kids,” Harris said. “We hadn’t been to the zoo before. We’re happy to be here when the new panda is coming.”
His children interrupted him to express their excitement over the pandas.
“They’re really cute,” the Harris children said. “They’re pretty far up on my list.”
Kate Cole (MSB ’18), president of Animalia, a student group that aims to ensure humane animal treatment, praised the cooperation between the National Zoo and China.
“I think it’s great that the zoo is working towards helping the panda population stay alive and trying to get it off the endangered list. I love the bear,” Cole said. “If China decided that the zoo is the best place for it to be raised then that’s awesome. China loves their pandas so much that I’m sure if they chose for it to be raised here, then that’s the best thing for it and that’s all you can ask for.”

The District of Columbia Public School Global Education Program recently launched its first-ever study abroad initiative, set to begin in the summer of 2016.
Four hundred students and teachers will have the opportunity to spend eight to 19 days in one of 12 countries this June and July, free of charge to the participants. The trips, which focus on service, leadership and language immersion, are open to students in 8th or 11th grade enrolled in a world language course.  D.C. public schools offer at least one of these seven language courses: American Sign Language, Arabic, French, Italian, Latin, Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.
The study abroad program is funded by the D.C. Public Education Fund, a local nonprofit that covers transportation, housing and meals, as well as passport and visa fees for all participants. The comprehensive funding aims to make the program accessible to students from all backgrounds and varying financial means.
The Public Education Fund is contributing $2.78 million in total to fund DCPS Global Education Programs.
Portfolio Director for the Public Education Fund Katie Aiello-Howard said that the program is part of DCPS’s aim to provide the best possible learning experience for its students.
“Every DCPS student should be excited to come to school every day, and DCPS knows that a student who is motivated to learn is one who is also exposed to enriching educational experiences,” Aiello-Howard wrote in a press release published in January 2016. “By creating more rigorous world language programs through an increase in current content offerings, DCPS can better prepare students to be globally experienced graduates.”
DCPS hopes that the program will not only expose the students to foreign cultures but also improve their linguistic skills and prepare them for their future after graduation, be it in college or for a career.
DCPS Press Secretary Michelle Lerner highlighted the importance of educating students about the global community.
“DC Public Schools is committed to providing a world-class education to its students. The opportunity to better understand a more global world is an imperative part of that strategy,” Lerner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We want every DCPS graduate to be an inquisitive, informed and active world citizen, prepared for an increasingly diverse international community.”
To be considered for the program, students must submit an application that includes short essay questions and a reference from a non-family member by Feb. 15. In addition to the language course prerequisite, students must demonstrate their commitment to the program’s various requirements.
Applicants in the 8th grade can apply to attend one of five trips offered to Costa Rica, Ecuador, Spain, China, France or Italy. The trips to China and Ecuador emphasize connecting culture to service, while the other three are primarily intended for the purpose of language immersion.
The 11th graders, on the other hand, can choose from 11 locations: Belgium, Chile, China, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, France, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Peru and Spain. Out of the 11 programs, five focus on language immersion, five are service learning-oriented and one is designed to foster global leadership.
Lerner stressed the importance of making the program available to students of all economic backgrounds in order to expose them to opportunities to travel internationally.
“Every student deserves a world of possibilities; that’s why DCPS developed a study abroad program,” Lerner wrote. “DCPS Study Abroad helps ensure that our global citizens have access to global experiences, so that travel becomes the expectation rather than the exception for students.”
Additionally, DCPS partnered with other organizations to offer cultural communication and general safety training to better prepare students for the experience of being abroad. These training sessions are led by “teacher ambassadors” appointed by the DCPS who will attend monthly meetings with the DCPS Global Education Program.
Lerner emphasized the preparation process as part of DCPS’s effort to cater to the whole student, highlighting how these trips may be the first international ones for some students.
“When we think about providing a rich education to every student, we think about the experiences, curriculum and tools our students need to be successful graduates of DC Public Schools, prepared for college or career,” Lerner wrote. “The chance to study abroad and see a part of the world fits into that frame.”
D.C. native Meghan Zorc (NHS ’19), who attended a private school, said that she wholly approves of this initiative as a means to expose students to new experiences.
“At my school, I did have an exchange program. When I was a sophomore in high school I got to experience learning in a different city before going to college and I think that’s a worthwhile experience,” Zorc said. “Hearing about the D.C. Public Schools’ initiative is remarkable, I think, because it gives kids the opportunity to travel that wouldn’t have the means to do it otherwise, and to experience these service opportunities before they’re exposed to it in high school.”

A group that backed a $10 million gift to Georgetown University in January has been linked with slavery and human trafficking in the Thai fishing industry, according to a report by the Guardian newspaper, prompting concern among students.
The Charoen Pokphand Group, a Thai conglomerate, created the Hong Kong-based Spring Breeze Foundation in 2015 in order to expedite its charitable donation process. The foundation announced Jan. 14 that it would donate $10 million over 10 years to the university for the creation of an Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues.
A 2014 investigation conducted by the Guardian newspaper found that the CP Group fed its shrimp with fishmeal supplied by fishing trawlers operated with slave labor.
In a 2014 Guardian editorial responding to the investigation, CP Foods Chairman Dhanin Chearavanont condemned slavery in the Thai fishing industry and emphasized the corporation’s commitment to combatting the use of slave labor in food production. According to the editorial, the CP Group eliminated suppliers suspected of human trafficking or slavery involvement. The Group also said it would conduct an audit on its suppliers and assist law enforcement authorities in these investigations.
“Through our research and development of alternative protein sources, CPF could walk away from fishmeal,” Chearavanont wrote. “However, doing so would shift the problem to the fishing industry, which is mostly comprised of fishermen earning their living in legal ways. The products of the fishing boats involved in human trafficking and slavery will continue to be purchased by other factories, and the issues around slavery will remain unchanged.”
The CP Group’s production accounts for 10 percent of the 50,000 tons of shrimp annually exported from Thailand and sold to foreign retailers such as Wal-mart and Costco.
The report described the experiences of Burmese and Cambodian migrants coerced into human trafficking rings.
“Men who managed to escape from boats supplying CP Foods and other companies like it told the Guardian of horrific conditions, including 20-hour shifts, regular beatings, torture and execution-style killings,” the Guardian reported June 10.
Shang Zhang (GRD ’11), an investment manager for CP Group’s subsidiary CT Bright Holdings, stressed the measures taken by the corporation to combat human trafficking. The CP Group founded the Shrimp Sustainable Supply Chain Task Force in 2014, which seeks to eliminate forced labor from Thailand’s seafood industry.
“CP is actively doing the right things in addressing the issue and improving the local context instead of walking away and shirking responsibility,” Zhang wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Vice President of Global Affairs Thomas Banchoff said that although the university was aware of the claims before accepting the gift, it was satisfied with the CP Group’s response to the slavery allegations.
“In our background research we examined a June 2014 report of slave labor on some of the fishing boats in CP Food’s shrimp industry supply chain,” Banchoff wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We were reassured by the CP Group’s immediate response to the report – to reiterate its opposition to all aspects of human trafficking and slavery and to invite independent NGOs to routinely audit its suppliers.”
Celeste Chen (COL ’14, GRD ’17) was among a group of current Georgetown students who first called attention to the potential unethical practices of the donor group in a letter to The Hoya. Chen drew parallels between Georgetown’s acceptance of the donation and the renaming of McSherry and Mulledy Halls last November in light of lingering racial sensitivities associated with their namesakes’ involvement with slavery.
“The fact that we’re now accepting money that is connected and supported by a company that not only runs modern-day slavery, but also has acknowledged it and said that it can’t really do anything to stop it because it is what it is, is just incredibly hypocritical,” Chen said. “It needs to be re-examined, like what our motives are and if we really learned anything from the fact that we decided to rename the residence halls. Did we learn anything from the media coverage, from the student sit-ins, did the administration actually consider that?”
Chen also questioned whether the CP Group’s link to the Chinese government as its first foreign investor threatens the autonomy of the initiative’s research. However, Banchoff said that academic independence is a foundational aspect of the new program.
“Georgetown maintains full independence to manage the initiative consistent with our mission and values– a principle that the donor fully acknowledges,” Banchoff wrote. “Independence is one of four foundational principles for the initiative, alongside transparency, balance and academic excellence. All four are designed to ensure that the initiative upholds academic freedom and promotes the open exchange of ideas.”
Amin Gharad (COL ’16), former president of Georgetown’s chapter of Amnesty International, said the university should examine the moral implications of accepting the gift.
“If these things are true, those are serious moral considerations that need to be looked at if the university decides to go through with this [initiative],” Gharad said. “From what I know, this is a very serious thing that should be investigated, and if it’s found to be true, I would like to think the very least you could do is not participate and not give any credence to the immoral activities of these human trafficking syndicates.”
Gharad said he is weary of the selective outrage that accompanies human rights abuses.
“When these things happen in Nigeria or in Iraq at the hands of groups that are enemies of the state and rightfully so, we have no problem not only condemning it but also taking deliberate action to have nothing to do with it in terms of incentivizing it,” Gharad said. “I don’t see why this would be any different, considering it was done under the auspices of the Thai government or a big fancy corporation that has billions and billions of dollars just turning a blind eye.”

Former Governor of Utah and U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman promoted a bipartisan approach to resolving foreign and domestic issues to a crowd of about 80 people in Old North Thursday.
Huntsman, who serves as the national co-chair of No Labels, an organization dedicated to bipartisan engagement and solution-building, was hosted by No Labels Georgetown along with the Institute of Politics and Public Service, College Republicans and the International Relations Club.
Huntsman began the discussion by emphasizing the ever-increasing levels of gridlock in U.S. politics. Huntsman said future generations need to resolve gridlock in order for the government to become more effective.
“My generation has brought you gridlock. And I feel badly about that,” Huntsman said. “Your generation is going to have to bring us problem solving and that means crossing the impenetrable divides of politics and anything else you want to throw between humankind.”
No Labels Georgetown President Max Rosner (COL ’18) led the conversation with Huntsman and focused on foreign policy and the Islamic State group.
“How can our leaders begin to forge a bipartisan strategy to deal with this problem and what might that strategy look like?” Rosner asked.
Huntsman advocated for increasing educational opportunities, believing that learning institutions are vital to changing violent ideologies.
“How do you change the hearts and minds of people who have fallen into radicalization?” Hunstman asked. “I only know one way; it is called education. You open the doors of institutions like this one, like other great institutions of higher learning in the world.”
Huntsman also addressed rhetoric from the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, arguing that candidates’ statements on fighting terrorism are detrimental to the country as a whole.
“We are not going to make the sand glow in the dark, we are not going to carpet bomb people. This is just nonsense that does no good whatsoever for this country of 320 million great people,” Huntsman said.
Huntsman also emphasized the importance of bipartisanship in his own life. A Republican, Huntsman served as ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011 under President Barack Obama.
“It is always America first. It is not your party first — it is American first,” Huntsman said.
Huntsman added that the mission of No Labels embodies the direction U.S. politics should follow.
“We are trying to move the nation[al] debate from anger, acrimony and finger-pointing to problem solving,” Huntsman said.
No Labels aims to have all presidential candidates sign the Problem Solver Promise, agreeing to help find bipartisan solutions to one of four goals, including the creation of 25 million jobs over ten years, securing Socia Security and Medicare for 75 years, balancing the federal budget by 2050 and securing U.S. energy by 2024.
“Within thirty days of getting elected president of the United States, you will meet a bipartisan group of leaders from Capitol Hill and you will choose one of the four silos around the National Strategic Agenda and you will lead out and make it happen,” Huntsman said.
Huntsman said that he predicts deep divisions to form among Republicans, potentially leading  to the formation of a new party.
“We are drifting today and I think we are seeing fissures within the party that have created the rise of populism,” Huntsman said. “It is as if you are seeing a new party being born even as we sit here tonight.”
Huntsman warned that the current state of campaign finance is destroying the trust that citizens have in representatives and encouraged reform.
“We’ve got to ameliorate the trust deficit, because in the long-term campaign finance and gerrymandering is corrosive,” Huntsman said. “We can tinker around all day and let that metastasize and kill the body politic or we can say ‘instead of complaining, instead of cutting somebody else down, we are going to step up and find a solution.’”
Huntsman also stressed the importance of environmental protection and conservation, acknowledging that conservation was originally a core Republican tenant dating back to former President Theodore Roosevelt’s term.
“It ain’t the party of Roosevelt anymore,” he said.
As the event drew to a close, Huntsman said the nation’s populace needs more confidence to make effective change.
“We have become way too cynical as a people. We’ve lost our blue sky sense of optimism and our can-do spirit,” Huntsman said.
Jenny Liang (SFS ’18) said that she agreed with Huntsman’s promotion of bipartisanship and how such dialogue increases the effectiveness of policy.
“It was great, especially when he talks about No Labels and how bipartisan cooperation between both parties is essential for future American policy both domestic and foreign,” Liang said.
Sami Scheetz (COL ’18) found Huntsman’s views to be a reprieve from politics surrounding the current election cycle.
“What he is saying today really resonated with what I think and is my general opinion of where politics is today,” Scheetz said. “It was very refreshing break from what we have been hearing in the 2016 election year.”
Simon Wu (SFS ’16) admired Huntsman’s proposed policy measures and dedication to bipartisan doctrine.
“I have always been a huge fan of Jon Huntsman and I think that it is incredible that everything that comes out of his mouth is so reasonable and measured and that’s something that does not exist anymore in sufficient quantity in government,” Wu said.

Members of the Georgetown delegation to the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, also known as COP21, discussed their experience and optimism for the new climate deal with the Georgetown community at an event Monday afternoon in the Mortara Center titled, “What Happened in Paris?”
The discussion was part of the Energy and Climate Policy Research Seminar, a program that encourages dialogue between students and faculty on the topics of international and domestic energy and climate change policy.
The delegation that traveled to Paris for the conference included Associate Professor of Science, Technology and International Affairs in the School of Foreign Service Joanna Lewis, Executive Director of the Georgetown Climate Center Vicki Arroyo and students Norah Berk (SFS ’15) and Alexandra Donovan (SFS ’17).
Lewis began the event by addressing the delegation and mainstream climate movement’s mixed reviews of COP21; some have deemed it a landmark achievement while others contest it will not solve climate change.
“I absolutely agree that this is not going to solve climate change but I think this is an extremely important step because we didn’t have a global platform to talk about solving climate change really until this agreement,” Lewis said.
Lewis outlined key factors that have shifted since the Kyoto Protocol was agreed upon., and making the Paris agreement possible, including the lack of country categories, groupings that exist to list countries together by their economic status and emissions targets,and the creation of targets through a bottom-up process, as opposed to a top-down process.
“Bottom-up means each country can look at their own economy and resources and they can say, ‘Well, we may not be able to cap our emissions today but I think we can accelerate a reduction, we can accelerate using renewable energy, we can slow deforestation,’” Lewis said. “So you see that these pledges that countries put forward are very nationally tailored to their circumstances, which ends up working better and getting more participation.”
Lewis attributed the negotiations’ success to the substantially evolved and improved relations between the United States and China as a result of regular meetings and bilateral discussions on climate change.
“Last November, the joint U.S.-China announcement on climate change paved the way for the targets that countries ended up agreeing on in Paris, and the language in that joint agreement ended up mobilizing a lot of the developing world and it led to a more comprehensive agreement,” Lewis said.
Arroyo said the inclusion of countries, businesses, investors, states and equivalent local people resulted in 196 countries joining together and committing to the final agreement, an improvement from past climate talks in Copenhagen in 2009 that ended with virtually no lasting progress.
“It’s not what we need to stay within the two degree Celsius [warming limit],” Arroyo said. “But for the first time you see everybody playing a role, everybody pulling together in the same direction, instead of the finger pointing that we had seen after Copenhagen.”
Arroyo attributed part of the success at COP21 to the intense role of sub-national actors, including nearly 1,000 mayors, governors and other subnational officials from around the world who took part in discussions.
“You see governors or mayors taking time out of their busy schedules, dealing with day-to-day crises, willing to come and talk about something like climate change because they are on the front lines,” Arroyo said.
Arroyo praised President Obama’s climate speech at Georgetown for providing momentum for COP21.
“He set the course for major reductions in this country … really using the full administrative authority of the White House and other agencies to support both reductions in green house gases but also to promote resilience,” Arroyo said. “It really was a turning point in my mind in terms of being able to see the kind of leadership federally which also influences international negotiations.”
Arroyo said although the Paris climate conference was a success, there is still a long road ahead.
“We arrived to 70 degree temperatures in mid-December here in D.C. and realized, ‘Wow, we need to get back to work,’” Arroyo said.
Donovan, a current Georgetown student who attended the conference while abroad in Paris, was impressed by the diversity of representatives at COP21.
“I was struck by how there were so many people there that were so passionate about the same subject. Everyone brought a unique perspective.”
Joan Abbott (SFS ’16) said it was important for students, specifically STIA majors, to attend this event and learn about the intersection of environmental policy and international relations.
“Not every STIA major is necessarily a climate person and I think it’s important that students come and hear about the current events,” Abbott said. “People are focused on the science but they don’t realize the importance of the negotiations and how delicate those situations are.”
Leyla Jiang (GRD ’17) said she was encouraged by the positive outlook the speakers had after attending COP21.
“From my experience views about climate change deals are more negative, criticizing how pragmatic this deal is but being here and listening to [the speakers’] experiences in Paris, it gives me this hope because I believe everyone who is here is very committed to this problem … it motivates you to stay in this business,” Jiang said.

Georgetown accepted 3,276 of 20,002 applicants to the Class of 2020 at an overall admissions rate of 16.4 percent, consistent with that of last year.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions sent out decisions for the regular application cycle Friday.
Of the total applicants, 2,384 were accepted through regular decision and 892 were admitted through early action. The overall acceptance rate of 16.4 percent marks a slight drop from the rates of the past five years, which hovered between 16.5 and 16.8 percent.
This year’s accepted class saw the second-largest pool of regular applicants since the 20,100 received in 2012. Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) pointed to various factors behind the high number of applications, but emphasized the university’s focus on the quality rather than quantity of its pool.
“We are not in the business of trying to build a huge pool, but rather to get a solid group of applicants,” Deacon said. “The combination of the Georgetown brand, name and location, and of course the themes of social justice and the Jesuit person for others seems to be resonating with these kids more and more as an attractive option.”
Both the Georgetown College and the McDonough School of Business saw slightly higher acceptance rates than last year. The College admitted 1,877 students at a rate of 16.1 percent, an increase from the previous year’s 15.9 percent, while the MSB accepted 536 applicants at a rate of 16.2 percent, a rise from last year’s 15.7 percent.
The School of Foreign Service and the School of Nursing and Health Studies saw a decline in acceptance rates. The SFS admitted 654 students at a rate of 17.2 percent, a slight decrease from the Class of 2019’s 17.6 percent. The NHS had the largest drop in acceptance rate, admitting 209 applicants at a rate of 17 percent compared to last year’s 19.7 percent.
Deacon stressed the need to reduce emphasis on application numbers and acceptance rates. He also pointed to Georgetown’s unique characteristics that allow it to attract high-caliber students.
“There is too much of a focus on that kind of a number that’s not healthy, I don’t think, in the long run,” Deacon said. “I don’t think we need to, because we’re increasingly one of those places that’s got kind of this very strong niche, where we don’t have many competitors in this particular space, if you will, which is Washington.”
Students from all 50 states were accepted to the Class of 2020. Continuing the trend of past years, New York, California and New Jersey were the top three states, with 436 students, 381 students and 238 students admitted respectively.
As with last year, nine percent of admits were international students. This year’s class originated from 70 different countries, compared to 72 last year. The majority of foreign applicants came from China, the United Kingdom and South Korea.
“I marvel at how lucky Georgetown is to have such a diverse set of people. You sit here and watch the presidential campaign going on, and you say, ‘Don’t these people realize the changing America?’ We see it right in front of us, it’s inexorably happening,” Deacon said.
Eleven percent of admitted applicants identified as black, while 17 percent identified as Asian, the same percentages as the previous year. Eleven percent of the accepted class identified as Latino, a slight decrease from last year’s 12 percent.
The acceptance rate for legacy students saw a sharp decline from 37 percent last year to 25 percent for the Class of 2020. Deacon said that, similarly to previous years, legacy students comprised around 10 percent of all admits.
Around 220 students were also offered the opportunity to join the Georgetown Scholarship Program, which provides financial aid to those from low-income backgrounds and first-generation college students.
Deacon anticipated a yield rate of 47 percent for this year’s class, keeping with trends in the past 10 years in which the rate has ranged from 43 to 48 percent. The enrollment target for the final class is 1,580, the same as previous years and consistent with the cap of 6,675 undergraduates laid out in the 2010 Campus Plan.
Deacon noted that yield rates in the MSB and the NHS in particular have increased to over 50 percent in the past several years. He attributed this to rising competition in the job market and student desire for employment security.
“Both [the MSB and the NHS], I think, are probably reflecting the job market issue. They are schools that seem to more directly confer an outcome,” Deacon said. “We do see pressure on students as they’re completing high school to worry about outcome on the other end.”
Similarly to previous years, around 2,000 students were offered a spot on the waitlist. Deacon anticipated that roughly 70 to 100 students will be accepted when final decisions are released by May 15.
He emphasized that this year’s waitlist is strong, noting that the average waitlisted student had nearly identical SAT scores to the average admit.
“We purposely try not to make the waiting list large and not put anybody on there as a gesture,” Deacon said. “The only people on the waitlist are people we would be accepting if there were room for them.”
Admitted students will be invited to attend Georgetown Admissions Ambassadors Program Open Houses on the weekends of April 15 and 22. Final enrollment decisions are due by May 1.
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that 3,276 applicants were accepted through regular decision and 892 were admitted through early action. 2,384 students for the Class of 2020 were accepted through regular decision and 892 were admitted through early action.

Georgetown students and alumni discussed the relative success of the most recent climate talks in Paris and climate change’s negative impact on women in a forum hosted by the Women’s Center in McShain Lounge on Thursday.
Joelle Thomas (SFS ’10), a Masters of Public Policy candidate at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, associate professor of science technology and international affairs Joanna Lewis, GUSA Secretary of Sustainability Caroline James (COL ’16) and Chair and Founder of the Sustainable Oceans Alliance Daniela Fernandez (COL ’16) commented as part of the panel.
Thomas developed her interest through a combination of classes taken at Georgetown and her time spent in East Africa working for a firm. Thomas’ master’s thesis assisted the United Arab Emirates in developing clean energy practices.
Lewis has experience in working in China to help reduce carbon emissions and find cleaner alternatives, and she has participated in various climate negotiations for the past decade.
Lewis, who was present for the negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol in 2005 and attended the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, said this conference was a huge leap forward in terms of both progress in climate legislation and awareness of climate change.
“Ten years ago, when we were negotiating in Kyoto, most of the countries didn’t know what climate change was, let alone have any climate policies,” Lewis said. “[Now] they are at a totally different world of knowledge and ability.”
James said the contributions of non-state negotiating groups and civil societies were significant at the conference. Indigenous groups living on islands, in danger of being swallowed up by the sea, successfully campaigned for countries to limit the global temperature rise by 1.5 degrees.
“That, for the indigenous groups, was considered a huge success, because they need that 1.5 target. For them that means that those islands survive,” James said.
The panelists also discussed the disproportionate impact of climate change on women. Fernandez said rising sea levels make it difficult for women in developing countries to find clean water, hindering other aspects of their life.
“I have met and heard about women having to spend a lot of time seeking access to clean water, which prevents them from being active participants in society,” Fernandez said.
According to James, climate change exacerbates existing discrimination and inequality.
“I think a really helpful framework for this stuff is to think of climate change as a threat multiplier,” James said. “Oppressed people are going to be the worst affected by the effects of climate change.”
Thomas said reaching out to women can be a more effective way of creating change in communities because of their important role in many communities.
“We would often meet with women, because women in many of these communities actually have informal authority,” Thomas said. “They often have a little bit more compassion.”
James stressed in the case of the Zika virus, which has been aggravated by climate change, women are the main population affected.
“These are issues that women are going to face a lot more than men, and they get the moral stigma attached to it. This is the last thing that women need in order to live healthy and productive lives,” James said.
Before taking questions from the audience, the panel discussed the role of activism and advocacy for environmental issues on college campuses.
Lewis said she is glad more women are taking part in the environmental protection movement and running non-governmental organizations. However, she said she sees a need for more women to participate in the STEM field, which is crucial to combating climate change.
“You still see less women in the technical areas,” Lewis said.
Fernandez said social media is also a powerful instrument used to raise awareness of climate change issues.
“Right now the platforms of social media are really tools for change that we have, which no generation ever has had in the past,” Fernandez said.
Thomas said she sees climate change as a problem for the current millennial generation to fix and stressed the urgency needed to resolve the issue.
“I think there is something about climate change and the millennial generation that goes together in many ways,” Thomas said. “I feel like it is the issue of our generation because we are the ones who are going to have to deal with it if we mess it up.”
Mary Rogers (COL ’16) said she enjoyed the discussion and appreciated that the panelists described a wide range of key issues.
“I thought it was a really great event. The panelists touched on a bunch of different aspects that are sometimes ignored with climate change, especially the intersectionality piece on how it affects women and populations that are typically underserviced,” Rogers said.
Maura Quinn (COL ’19) said she learned a lot from the event and enjoyed the different viewpoints presented.
“As a person that hasn’t dealt that much into climate change, this was very very enlightening,” Quinn said. “It was very interesting hearing that perspective in this panel as well as things about oceans and things I have never heard before.”

Dr. Ernest Moniz defended the Iran nuclear deal and argued for a renewed push toward green energy technology at the 2016 Trainor Lecture and Award in the Intercultural Center on Monday.
Hosted by the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, Moniz was honored for his role in the Iran nuclear negotiations and awarded the 32nd Jit Trainor Award for distinction in the conduct of diplomacy.
Moniz participated in the P-5+1 talks between the permanent United Nations member states, China and the European Union as a part of the American-led international delegation working toward a plan to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
The nuclear agreement requires Iran to roll back its nuclear program and imposes a verification system to ensure it does not initiate new efforts to obtain a nuclear device, in exchange for lifting sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy since 1996. Former Ambassador to Yemen and Director of the ISD Barbara K. Bodine welcomed the audience before introducing School of Foreign Service Dean Joel Hellman, who praised Moniz as a scientist serving the nation and one of the first scientists to win the Trainor Award.
“The transnational challenges we are facing go beyond the capacity of any single nation-state to solve,” Hellman said. “Individually and as the head of the Department of Energy, he really epitomizes the role of science in the service of the national interest and global community.”
Moniz emphasized the long, active role in diplomacy that the Department of Energy has played over the years, balancing multiple responsibilities including nuclear security and climate change.
“[The DOE] is sometimes referred to as the Department of Weapons and Windmills, Quarks and Quagmires because of the nuclear security responsibilities and clean energy, particularly climate change,” Moniz said. “It is the largest supporter of the physical sciences in the United States and we operate the key facilities like accelerators and resources that serve over 30,000 scientists each year to do their work.”
Moniz said he worked to build trust with Iranian scientists based around their work as scientists in negotiations.
“We had to go through a myriad of trade-offs, but the important thing is that a relationship of trust was built up at the scientist-to-scientist level,” Moniz said. “This did not in any way diminish our responsibility to achieve our core objectives, but it was built upon a trust in which we felt what was being discussed was always an honest proposition.”
Moniz said he was proud of the progress that he achieved through these negotiations.
“Until recently, the major focus was on eliminating their plutonium capability, which would come from a rack reactor that was under construction. It would produce more than enough plutonium for a bomb a year. The discussion was all around who would bomb it when. That was what was in the news,” Moniz said. “Today, the core of that reactor has been filled with cement as a result of the negotiations. Sounds to me like a better outcome.”
According to Moniz, criticism surrounding the deal tends to focus on what the deal does not do, instead of what it accomplishes.
“It did not stop arms transfers to Hezbollah, it did not solve the Houthi problem, it did not solve the missile problem. That was a choice made years ago that a manageable negotiation would be attempted,” Moniz said. “It’s very similar to what President Reagan did in the 1980s in negotiating arms control separate from all of our other problems with the Soviet Union.”
Following Moniz’s lecture, ISD Board Chairman and Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering moderated a question-and-answer segment, which featured questions ranging from potential plans for the United States to begin a fuel-leasing program to the roles Georgetown students play in combating climate change.
Maria Ciacci (SFS ’18) said she enjoyed listening to Moniz’s explanation of the Iran deal.
“I thought it was really informative. I like that he kept it basic enough for anyone that’s not necessarily in the field to understand,” Ciacci said. “He was really thorough with the history of his field as well as the Iran deal, and it was easy to understand and really see the intersection of diplomacy and science.”
Will Hallisey (COL ’16) also praised the secretary’s explanation of the DOE’s responsibilities.
“My dad does energy investing and so I know a little bit about this stuff, but it’s a brave new world because you have to figure out a world where there’s a cohesive interconnection of energy opportunities,” Hallisey said. “Someone talked about oil in developing countries, they mentioned it’s the department of weapons and they really do have a very encompassing job. His expertise is very encompassing as well.”
Hallisey said the lecture clarified his understanding of the Iran nuclear talks.
“You get the sound bytes on TV of the less educated point of view, but the fact that he is fundamentally assured of his position because he’s so educated, exactly what it takes for a country to have a nuclear weapon,” Hallisey said. “I think that’s what was one of the most important parts because you really do realize how extensively affected these people, these individuals.”

Sister Helen Prejean, one of America’s leading opponents of the death penalty, discussed the importance of grace and forgiveness in her fight to overcome a global culture of death and judgment in the annual Bernardin Address in Copley Formal Lounge on Saturday. Prejean is the author of “Dead Man Walking,” an account of her experiences with two death-row inmates.
More than 120 members of the Georgetown community attended the event, which was hosted by pro-life student groups the Francis Project and Georgetown Right to Life
Prejean, a member of the Congregation of Saint Joseph, discussed an account of her relationship with death-row inmate Patrick Sonnier, a prisoner who killed two teenagers, Loretta Ann Bourque and David LeBlanc. Prejean was Sonnier’s spiritual advisor, and stood by his side during his execution.
Prejean described meeting David’s father, Lloyd LeBlanc, for the first time two weeks before Sonnier’s execution. Instead of spiting her for defending his son’s killer, Lloyd invited Prejean to pray with him, a powerful moment for Prejean.
“It was as we prayed that I got the first glimpse of his soul. He’s the hero of ‘Dead Man Walking,’” Prejean said. “As he grew to trust me, as I kept going back, then he took me into his heart.”
Prejean said LeBlanc told her how he stopped being kind after his son’s death, and that he was only able to save himself through forgiveness.
“‘They killed our son but I’m not going to let them kill me,’” Prejean said, quoting LeBlanc. “And he began to set his face to go down the road where he knew Jesus was waiting for him.”
Prejean created a program in New Orleans called Survive, which offers counseling to the loved ones of the victims of violent crimes.
Through her work with Survive, Prejean said she began to see how considerations of race bias the system of capital punishment.
According to Prejean, eight out of every 10 people who are executed or currently on death row have been sentenced for killing a white person.
“And when people of color are killed, it is a negligible death because it is a negligible life. Black lives matter,” Prejean said.  “When it comes to being a victim of homicide, you can just see it for yourself in the record.”
Prejean said prosecutors more easily identify with white victims and are hesitant to bring the death penalty against wealthy criminals who can afford to establish stronger legal defenses.
Prejean said the issue of the death penalty is part of a broader dialogue about the sanctity of all life.
“We need to be for life. From the unborn child just trying to be born to the person with Alzheimer’s who doesn’t even know their name: Human life has dignity, all life has dignity,” Prejean said.
Prejean said the run up to Sonnier’s execution and others like his subverted the value of human life.
“We do not yet have a Supreme Court that recognizes the mental torture that goes into taking conscious human beings with imaginations and giving them a date of death which they anticipate and die inside their minds a thousand times,” Prejean said.
Prejean said she struggled to find meaning in Prejean’s death.
“He says to me, ‘Sister, please pray God holds up my legs while I make this walk.’ Where is the dignity in this death?” Prejean said.
According to Prejean, the United States is currently among the global leaders in executions per year, alongside China, Iran and Yemen. However, support for the death penalty is at an all-time low and seven states have repealed it in the past 10 years.
Prejean said she is hopeful that the punishment will soon be abolished worldwide.
Associate Vice President for Student Affairs and Faculty Advisor to the Francis Project Jeanne Lord said preserving the dignity of all human life is entailed in Georgetown’s Catholic identity.
“I think for us as Catholics it is a very critical social justice issue. If you look at the mission and the identity of Georgetown University, we are committed to care for the whole person at all stages of life,” Lord said.
President of Georgetown Right to Life Michael Khan (COL ’18) said Prejean’s address was compelling because of her passion and appeal to personal experience.
“When she began to work with [death row inmates] and learn that they were actual humans with — as she mentioned — human emotions and faces, she really found the passion for [her work]. That’s what she shared today and I thought that was really helpful for our students,” Khan said.
Co-Director of the Cardinal O’Connor Conference on Life Spencer Crawford (SFS ’16) said he believes Georgetown students are predominantly in opposition to the death penalty.
“To see a room filled up on a Saturday afternoon to hear someone give a talk against the death penalty showed me where Georgetown stands on an issue like this,” Crawford said.

Eighty teams with over 1,000 participants raised over $138,000 at Georgetown’s annual Relay for Life fundraiser to benefit the American Cancer Society Friday, breaking 2015’s total of $133,000.
The theme of this year’s Relay for Life was “Cirque du Relay,” where the Relay committee sought to create a carnival atmosphere with games, dance classes, soccer matches and music from Georgetown student groups. A silent memory walk late in the night — the “Luminaria Ceremony” — encouraged students to reflect on how they and others have been touched by cancer, and included a performance by the Georgetown Phantoms.
According to event co-chair Emily Horne (COL ’18), the group’s fundraising has declined each year for the past five years, following the first Relay for Life event in 2007. Last year marked the first time in five years that the event raised more than the prior year’s event.
The Relay for Life Executive Committee, Georgetown Sigma Phi Epsilon, the American Cancer Society’s Can Extreme team, Fred’s Fighters and Georgetown Kappa Kappa Gamma raised the most money at the 2016 event. The Executive Committee raised $31,015.55 as of press time, followed by SigEp and the Can Extreme team at $28,268 and $9,383, respectively.
“It’s definitely been my favorite Relay at Georgetown but I also just think it’s been such a successful night after a year of planning,” Horne said.
Event co-chair Stephen Laufer (SFS ’16) said the event is consistently strong because of its ability to bring Georgetown students together.
“I think everyone in some sort of way is touched by cancer, and Relay for Life is a really great opportunity for people at Georgetown who normally wouldn’t attend the same events to come together for a common cause,” Laufer said. “It’s something that really unites and bonds people and provides support for one another.”
This year’s event featured many changes as a result of turnover within the Relay for Life executive board, after many members graduated. Laufer praised the underclassmen for pulling off the event.
“All of these sophomores and juniors who had never experienced what it was like to be on the executive team really stepped up to the plate to make this event happen.” Laufer said.
According to Horne, the tents and booths at the event were also rearranged on Cooper Field to make the event feel more intimate, with luminaries forming a border around field.
Alexander Zigerelli (MSB ’17), a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said he believes participation is especially important for Greek organizations given the reputation of Greek life nationally and its status as unrecognized at Georgetown.
“There’s a lot of negative stigma about fraternities and sororities because people think we only party but there’s so much more to the culture,” Zigerelli said. “There’s so much more we do in trying to help out the community in every way we can.”
SigEp’s Vice President of Philanthropy Christian DeRosa (COL ’17) said his fraternity comes together every year for Relay due to his chapter’s longstanding connection with the effects of cancer. SigEp captured second place for funds raised this year, and raised more than the Relay Executive Committee last year at $34,690, the first in the event’s history.
“It’s something that we can all kind of bond over. I mean, one of our founding brothers actually had testicular cancer his senior year when he graduated, and then went on to become a doctor, and he definitely still keeps us motivated on that front,” DeRosa said. “I think every single person in the fraternity has either a direct or indirect tie to cancer, and in the same way that at Relay itself people share stories, we do that internally as well.”
Stephen Tranchina (COL ’18), who participated in Relay as a member of Club Swimming, also stressed the importance of volunteering for a good cause.
“It’s a tradition we have because we like to get involved with campus outreach, and we all either have known someone or been affected by cancer in some way whether it’s a relative or a friend,” Tranchina said. “So it’s our way to give back and do something more than just swim.”

A day after he swept 118 delegates in five state primaries, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump delivered a speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday in which he delineated his foreign policy platform, including his plans to halt the growth of radical Islam and mend relations with China and Russia.
The speech, delivered at the invitation of the Center for the National Interest, a public policy think tank based in D.C., was met with criticism by Georgetown professors and students.
Trump said this mindset of re-invigorating Western values will provide the foundation for his decisions in international affairs.
“My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first,” Trump said. “No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must do the same.”
Throughout his speech, Trump outlined five main weaknesses of current American foreign policy — the overextension of resources, failure to force allies to pay their fair share, the perceived view of allies’ lack of dependence on the United States, the lack of respect from rivals and a lost understanding of clear foreign policy goals.
“Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster,” Trump said. “No vision, no purpose, no direction, no strategy.”
According to Trump, U.S. foreign policy declined after the Cold War in a series of disastrous mistakes made in Iraq, Egypt, Libya and Syria, which fostered the development of terrorist organizations, such as the Islamic State group to grow in power.
“It all began with the dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western Democracy,” said Trump, “We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of American lives and many trillions of dollars were lost as a result.”
Trump referenced what he views as shortcomings of the Obama administration, such as America’s trade deficit, its military spending compared with other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Iran deal.
“If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job,” Trump said.
Throughout the rest of the speech, Trump outlined his plans to fix these problems and form a coherent foreign policy in order to pull the United States out of the nation-building business and to emphasize stability.
Government professor Matthew Kroenig said Trump’s speech lacked specificity, comparing it to speeches made by other presidential candidates such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If this was meant to be his serious foreign policy speech, he didn’t deliver. The speech was very short on detail and if you compare this major foreign policy speech to Hillary Clinton or some of the other candidates, there’s not really anything there,” Kroenig said. “Look at his strategy for defeating ISIS — he says something about working with Muslim partners, says something about immigration, and then moves on.”
Georgetown’s Senior Associate Dean for Undergraduate Affairs Daniel Byman also said the speech reflected a lack of detail as well as containing inconsistencies.
“Trump was long on promises and criticisms, but light on specifics and solutions,” Byman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He often tried to have it both ways, criticizing Obama and the Democrats in inconsistent ways. The speech was more scripted than previous addresses, but it dodged the hard issues.”
Government professor Andrew Bennett identified major inconsistencies in Trump’s address and criticized his campaign tactics.
“On the one hand it seems consistent with his inconsistency,” said Bennett, “He continues to say things that are not compatible with each other over time and within the same speech. The campaign is not the time to be thinking seriously about these issues, the time to think about them is the years and decades leading up to the campaign.”
Nevertheless, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) released a statement praising Trump’s vision for positioning solutions to the nation’s most pressing foreign policy issues.
“I look forward to hearing more details, but in a year where angry rhetoric has defined the presidential race on both sides of the aisle, it is my hope that candidates in both parties will begin focusing not only on the problems we face but on solutions,” Corker wrote.
Georgetown University College Republicans Membership Director Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) said the speech reinforced his fear of a Trump presidency.
“He seems to have gotten so used to the yelling and cheering that occurs at a political rally that any speech which isn’t accompanied by raucous cheers and audience interaction comes off awkward and forced,” Estes wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This speech was an overwhelmingly failed attempt to appear more presidential. However, the statements made today served to reinforce how unprepared Trump is for the highest office in our land and how little weight his words actually carry.”
Kroenig also said he is concerned about the possibility of Trump becoming president.
“If anything I think that the speech should make us even more and not less concerned about what ‘President Trump’s’ foreign policy would look like,” Kroenig said.

When Anastasia Somoza (COL ’07) addressed the Democratic National Convention in July, she delivered a powerful endorsement of presidential nominee and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from her motorized chair. Born with cerebral palsy with spastic quadriplegia, the New York-based disability rights advocate now serves as a surrogate for the Clinton campaign after graduating from Georgetown College with a major in government and a minor in English. In an interview with The Hoya, Somoza reflects on the vitriolic election cycle, advances in disability activism and her own years at Georgetown.
Your address at the DNC was both a testament to the inclusivity of the Clinton campaign and a searing indictment of Trump’s divisiveness. You said at one point Trump “didn’t see me, didn’t hear me and definitely did not speak for me.” In a campaign characterized by nasty remarks and mudslinging on both sides, how did you draw this distinction?
Donald Trump has made it clear through all of his rhetoric that he doesn’t represent, will not fight for and is fearful of women, African Americans, Muslims, people with disabilities and other religious and ethnic minorities – in other words anyone who isn’t the all-American white male. It’s impossible to even attempt to claim to be the best candidate to address the most pressing needs of Americans and our interests when your core policy proposals are centered on deporting all immigrants and building a wall. Not to mention the fact Republican administrations are characterized by limiting government and, more often than not, the cuts are made in the areas of greatest need, including reducing funding to Medicaid and Medicare, both of which are relied upon by the disabled and elderly nationwide. By contrast, Hillary began her career at the Children’s Defense Fund fighting for the needs of families who have children with disabilities, working to increase the numbers of African Americans and other minorities registering to vote, advocating for women’s rights to be seen as human rights and fighting against all odds to make sure health care is a right for all Americans rather than a privilege afforded to some.
To cite a breaking example of the stark differences between the campaigns and candidates, Hillary has just announced her comprehensive agenda on mental health, which demonstrates her action toward addressing an unmet need. As far as I know, Donald Trump has yet to address this in any substantive way.
You came to the national spotlight when you plead with President Bill Clinton in a televised town hall at age 10 to place students like your twin sister Alba in regular classes away from a special education track. Over a decade later, how do you think policies for disabled students in the classroom have fared?
Families across this country are still waging battles at the school district level to make sure their children are included in mainstream classrooms and then, once they are, that they are given the appropriate support and access to accommodations, which can sometimes include assistive technology and individualized adjustments to their academic program. So the work to level the playing field in the classroom is far from over, but beyond that, as a young woman with a disability, I have struggled in the transition from academia into the work force. I am working on increasing the employment of people with disabilities in private industry through tax incentive programs and creating guidelines for a more inclusive workforce.
How can we best be allies to the disabled community?
In your daily lives, one of the important ways everyone can be an ally to those of us with disabilities is being inclusive of us in all school-related activities, groups and programs. If you notice an elevator on campus or a D.C. Metro station that is out of service, take the time to make the call to get it fixed.
Overall, how would you characterize your experience at Georgetown?
While at Georgetown I felt extremely supported by faculty and staff. What I remember sometimes being an issue was the frequency with which elevators on campus would break down and other physical accessibility-related issues, which from what I’ve heard have improved drastically over the years.
The Class of 2020 begins its freshman year this fall. What advice do you have for incoming students?
My advice to incoming freshmen would be to take every opportunity to meet people and discover ways in which you can become actively involved in campus life and really engage in activities that you are passionate about. As far as academics are concerned, it’s important to make the most of the time you have at the beginning of each academic term to sit in on classes and engage in conversations with professors about the content of the course and how the professor will determine your progress throughout the semester. For example, in my case I knew I was more comfortable writing papers than I was taking multiple choice exams. So to the extent that it’s possible, choose classes that fit your learning style and provide you with opportunities to highlight your strengths. Also, even if you think you’re confident about what you’d like to major and minor in, be sure to allow yourself the time and space to explore a variety of academic disciplines.
What are your plans for the months before the election and beyond?
I’m a believer in living in the moment, so I don’t have a five- or 10-year plan, but between now and the election I am honored and excited to be speaking as a surrogate on the campaign trail in support of Hillary. I’m also looking forward to a handful of speaking engagements this fall, including one that’s bringing me back to the Hilltop at the end of October. There are many thrilling projects and opportunities in the works that I hope to be able to elaborate on at a later date.
I’m consistently pursuing any opportunities to increase the visibility, inclusion and engagement of people with disabilities in everyday life. I’m currently working with a team of colleagues to open a parent resource center for families of children with disabilities in China. Some of my other areas of personal interest include increasing the accessibility of travel both nationally and internationally to people with disability. The most timely concern is increasing the voter registration of people with disabilities and facilitating their ability to vote.

The Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service’s third class of fellows consists of five individuals from varied backgrounds with extensive experiences in politics, government and media, including former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley (D).
GU Politics, an institute of the McCourt School of Public Policy, also selected former Chief of Staff at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing Scott Mulhauser, The Washington Post’s Deputy National Political Editor Rebecca Sinderbrand (COL ’99), former Senior Policy and Political Adviser to the Jeb Bush presidential campaign Michael Steel and CNN Politics Editor Juana Summers.
In an interview with The Hoya on Wednesday, the fellows discussed their goals for the upcoming semester and their thoughts on the current U.S. political landscape.
Why did you decide to come be a fellow with GU Politics?
Sinderbrand: This is a return trip for me to the Hilltop. This is eerie. I literally would sit at this table and use an Exact-O knife to cut out headlines and paste them with cement, that’s how old I am. I’m very happy to be here. I know – or I think I know – exactly what I’ll get when I come back here, which is fantastic discussion with Georgetown students, the kind that I miss. I’m also going to have a built in focus group where I can hear what people think of coverage, get idea, get thoughts. It’s the kind of opportunity reporters dream of.
Summers: I’m really excited to be here because I think it’s really important as a working journalist to be able to have an opportunity to get beyond the headlines and beyond the sound bites that can often drive campaign coverage. I do a really specialized job. I’m an editor for CNN Politics that focuses on data and I don’t have an opportunity in my day job to have a lot of rich conversations with people who are consuming the news that Rebecca and I and other journalists produce. I think that, much as Rebecca said, this will be a really great opportunity to be able to have those conversations with students who are smart and engaged and curious about the world around them.
Steel: I’m excited because young people are less and less interested in traditional politics. But that doesn’t mean they are unaffected by it or that it’s any less important. So I think it’s critical to learn from students why they’re not engaged by how the system works now and how the system can improve so that people have a greater interest in being involved.
Mulhausser: I just moved back to Washington from Beijing seven days ago, so it’s great to be home. After two years in China and 20 years in politics, I’m both frustrated and excited by all of this. Nothing is more exciting than coming back here, figuring out my own road ahead by talking to the students here, learning where they think things are going.
O’Malley: I ran for president and there was nothing more enjoyable about that frustrating experience than every day being with the young people that were the core of my campaign and that I got to work with every day. That give me a tremendous amount of faith and hope in our country and in our future as a people. So I’m looking forward to spending time with these young, forward-looking, terrific students at a great university, Georgetown.
Could you give me a sense of what you hope to achieve this semester as an IPPS fellow and what you think you bring, given your very different backgrounds?
Sinderbrand: I am going to be talking about campaign 2016 through a reporter’s point, which is not as someone running a campaign but someone who is observing it very closely, who is talking to the people who are involved in the campaign, who is making decisions about what they think is the most newsworthy element of a story and how we handle those stories. I was telling someone earlier that I hope there are people at Georgetown who would like to be journalists for a living, but I know there are people who are going to be working with journalists in their career, on Capitol Hill or elsewhere. Everyone is interested, I think, in news, to some extent. They’re news consumers, they’re paying attention to what’s happening, they have opinions on coverage, they’re curious about how the process works. I want to pull back the curtain a little bit about how we do it at the Washington Post every day.
Summers: My discussion group is about race and politics in 2016. I think that will be particularly exciting this political cycle and on this campus. For a variety of reasons, I think now is the time to have that conversation and conversations about race, and what our lived experiences are as it relates to the political cycle … I think we’ve really seen that come to life in having eight years of the nation’s first black president in President Barack Obama and the rise of the white working class voter that has largely fueled Donald Trump and the demographic changes that will make Latino and Hispanic voters one of the largest voting blocks in this country. I think it’s a really important moment to have this conversation. I hope when students come to my discussion group they feel safe and comfortable to have those conversations with their peers that they share this campus with, where race is obviously a big focal point right now due to Georgetown’s history.
Steel: There are a lot of institutions in Washington that aren’t working right now, that are designed more to serve interests rather than the people as a whole. There are a lot of ideas for reforming those institutions that also serve various interests, but not the people. I think we need to start fresh with a blank piece of paper and ask the question, ‘If you were organizing Congress today, how would you do it? If you were setting up the system to fund our presidential and other elections, how would you do it?’ Hopefully by going back to first principles and figuring out kind of an ideal system, we can come up with proposals that actually help with the way it’s done currently.
Mulhausser: I think when we look at what’s coming up in 13 days, the presidential debate that could be the most-watched event of our lifetimes, there are things that do work. So what makes campaigning work and how can campaigning be better? What makes debates work and how can they be better? What makes the media work? The media is doing a tremendous job covering this race. They are exposing things everyday and yet they’re being pilloried. We’d like to hear more about what they’re doing right and, both with them and others, what can be done better.
O’Malley: We’re going to be asking the question every week whether our country is becoming more polarized or less, has the pendulum swung, are we going to be able to recapture some common ground? So we’re going to be looking at issues starting with marriage equality, an issue that moved faster and gained a consensus very, very quickly. We’re going to look also at issues like criminal justice, which we can’t talk about without talking about race in America. We’re going to look at climate change, immigration reform and ask whether or not the pillars of Catholic social teaching — the dignity of every person, the common good we share and the unity of spirit and matter — might provide some framework and language for consensus.
What are your thoughts on the current U.S political climate, given your different backgrounds?
Mulhausser: I came back from two years in China, so it’s pretty rosy from that perspective. Maybe I’m wearing rose colored glasses but when you’ve got an electoral system that’s not done behind closed doors, where there is an incredibly dynamic back and forth, it’s not pretty or necessarily what any of us were hoping for but sometimes comparatively, it depends where you’re standing.
Steel: I’m personally incredibly frustrated. I’ve been part of a group that has spent the past 10 years of so recovering from the political effects of the last Bush presidency, winning the House in 2010, helping in a small way to take the majority in the Senate in 2014. This was a year when we had a great opportunity to elect a conservative reform president who would build on those ideas that had been developed the past several years and put those into practice. It is intensely frustrating every day to see that we seem to have nominated pretty much the only presidential candidate who couldn’t accomplish that goal.
Sinderbrand: For a reporter, every single campaign you have to learn something new. The way you deal with people on campaigns, that doesn’t change. But the way we report the news, the pace, the technology, every single time it’s been different. So that’s always an interesting experience.
O’Malley: I’m deeply concerned with where we are right now in our country’s politics. I’m so deeply concerned that I ran for president myself. I believe that this election poses a very non-traditional choice, a very stark choice and also presents a bit of a constitutional dilemma given the very unconstitutional positions that Donald Trump has taken on many issues. This, I believe, could well be the most important election. You hear people say that, it almost becomes trite. But we’ve never quite had a constitutional crisis like this, with so much anger, so much polarization, such a deep and broad sense of alienation from our own political leaders as you have in the electorate right now. Add to that declining wages and you have a very volatile soup here within which this constitutional crisis will be played out with the choice we all make or don’t make in November.

Independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin advocated for an American interventionist policy abroad at a Sept. 20 speech hosted by the McCourt School of Public Policy’s Institute of Politics and Public Service, which was followed by a question-and-answer session.
Hosted in the Healey Family Student Center, McMullin’s remarks, entitled “A New Era of American Leadership,” focused on human rights, the armed forces and America’s relationships with other countries.
McMullin, a former Central Intelligence Agency operations officer from 2001 to 2011 and chief policy director for the House Republican Conference, announced his candidacy for President last month. He also worked for Goldman Sachs, as a deckhand on a commercial fishing boat in Alaska and as a United Nations volunteer refugee resettlement officer.
In his speech at Georgetown, McMullin stressed that the repercussions of foreign conflicts can manifest themselves domestically. He attributed the rise of forces such as the Islamic State Group to the withdrawal of American leadership in the Middle East, allowing terrorism to reign in the resulting power vacuum.
“We may wish that we could simply ignore the world, but we can be sure that the rest of the world will not ignore us,” McMullin said.
McMullin maintained that health crises such as Ebola in West Africa and Zika in Latin America, as well as cyberattacks originating in China, Russia and North Korea, are deeply emblematic of a globalized world order where foreign problems cause domestic concerns.
However, McMullin also acknowledged not all American national security problems originate overseas, citing the United States’ debt crisis as a threat to its ability to uphold its armed forces.
According to the United States Treasury, the current national debt stands around $19.5 trillion.
McMullin cautioned that without reforms, the United States will spend $100 million more annually on interest payments than on defense.
“This will confront us with an untenable choice between massive tax increases or drastic spending cuts that could dangerously weaken our armed forces,” McMullin said. “If we do nothing, our debt will spiral out of control, bringing us ever closer to economic calamity.”
The presidential candidate offered his solution, insisting the government must make responsible reforms to entitlement programs, which are estimated to consume well over 75 percent of the U.S. budget.
He strictly maintained that no further cuts should be imposed on the budget of U.S. Armed Forces, calling the $900 billion budget cut by the Pentagon’s ten-year spending plan under the Obama administration a costly mistake. According to McMullin, this mistake resulted in the armed forces shouldering half the burden of deficit reduction cutting measures, despite the military only accounting for every one in every six federal dollars.
“Our fiscal challenges are choking off the resources that our troops need to remain the best in the world,” McMullin said.
McMullin also criticized the subpar equipment of the military, some of which dates back to the 1980s and 90s. Furthermore, he argued the military has insufficient funds for training. As a believer in achieving peace through strength, he advocated for the improvement of military equipment and training in order to maintain an unquestionable advantage over the rapidly rising armies of countries such as China and Russia.
At the same time, McMullin emphasized how the American commitment to the principle of freedom, both economic and personal, enables it to build a global network of allies and partners who value its leadership instead of fearing its domination.
“We seek not to build an empire, but rather to lead by example, to be a strong friend, a trusted ally, and to the adversaries of liberty, a feared enemy,” McMullin said.
As a former CIA operative, he stressed his firsthand experience as an advantage if he were to become president.
“I’ve experienced multiple wars firsthand. They’re more horrible than people who haven’t experienced them can imagine,” McMullin said. “I learned the precious value of peace and, as President, it would drive me to take the necessary steps to ensure our security.”
McMullin finished his speech by highlighting key principles that he says will inform his leadership and help make America safer, including the importance of the President’s personal conduct, the promotion of democracy and fundamental human rights, and the U.S. duty to intervene when human rights violations occur abroad.
The speech was followed by a question-and-answer session and concluded with an opportunity for attendees to engage with the candidate personally.
During the question-and-answer session, the conversation broached on topics ranging from women’s rights in Saudi Arabia to the current refugee crisis.
Grant Olson (COL ’19), who attended the event, said he appreciated the aspect of the event that gave students the opportunity to ask McMullin questions about his foreign policy.
 
 
“I had read a lot about McMullin and his candidacy in the news over the summer, and I was incredibly excited to see him talk,” Olson said. “Even though I am not a supporter of his candidacy, he is an ideas-focused candidate who adds to the debate that we are having about the direction that we want to head in as a nation.”
Lizzie Porterfield (COL ’19), who met McMullin after the event, also said she believed McMullin heightens the level of national political discourse.
“He was a really nice, down-to-earth guy,” Porterfield said. “And his policies were precise and well thought-out.”

After a month on the Hilltop, the Class of 2020 is beginning to settle into life on campus. These new Hoyas are part of the 16.4 percent of admitted applicants.
|
The Class of 2020 represents a diversity of backgrounds. Fourteen percent of the class identify as Asian, 9 percent as black and a further 9 percent as Latino. Ten percent applied from abroad; 8 percent were international and 2 percent were Americans living overseas.
China and the United Kingdom sent the most international students with 18 freshmen from each country. Italy, France, Peru, South Korea and Spain follow closely, sending seven or more students each. One-third of first-year students claim fluency in more than one language.
Thirty-five percent of domestic students are from the mid-Atlantic region with New York and New Jersey as the two most represented states.
In the Classroom
Despite their diverse origins, most freshmen agree that the level of academic rigor has met expectations thus far. Gaia Pipitone (COL ’20) said the academics have been refreshingly competitive.
“The academics are at a good standard but it’s healthy competitive,” Pipitone said.
According to Ethan Craunot (SFS ’20), the workload has not been too difficult.
“I have less work now than in high school but I had a lot of work in high school,” Craunot said.
Required courses most freshmen take include “Problem of God,” “Writing and Culture Seminar” and various introductory classes.
According Otto Hentz, a theology professor who has been teaching at the university for over 50 years,
“Problem of God” is a crucial component of the Georgetown freshman experience.
“It gets them started on a liberal arts education by having them address one of the most fundamental issues that must be mapped to address what it means to be human,” Hentz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It invites them to think, not just master ‘material.’”
Mustafa Karakaplan, who teaches 650 students, most of whom are freshmen, in his “Principles of Microeconomics” lecture, said the freshmen academic experience is unique.
“I am new too just like you guys but there is something about Georgetown freshmen that I like a lot,” Karakaplan said. “I don’t know how to express it but there is that feeling that whenever I enter the classroom that students are very engaged.”
David Gewanter, an English professor teaching “Writing and Culture Seminar” to freshmen, said students often struggle with transitioning from high school writing to college-level writing.
“Secondary school teachers in some cases will tell you things which are needed for the following year and they will teach you habits which are appropriate for their teaching,” Gewanter said. “Freshmen import them into college and it turns out to be a very different ball game.”
Adjunct professor Albert Pierce, who is currently teaching a School of Foreign Service pro-seminar titled “Ethical Challenges in Life and Literature” said the students in his freshman seminar each fall are eager to be at Georgetown.
“In my experience the students are just thrilled to be at Georgetown,” Pierce said. “What I enjoy is seeing some students in particular learn how much they can learn from their classmates.”
Outside the Classroom
Some freshmen like Arthur Manset (COL ’20) said they initially struggled to find a balance among studying, socializing and doing extracurricular activities.
“I think it’s tough, you have to adapt to a world where you’re on your own without your parents,” Manset said. “You have to discipline yourself and I think it’s a tough thing definitely. It’s a challenge but you learn from these types of experiences.”
Natalie Gómez (COL ’20) said she overcame the difficulty of juggling between social life and academics after a month on campus.
“I did find the balance,” Gómez said. “I don’t think I’ve been overwhelmed by one or the other.”
On-Campus Housing
Students were met with surprise when they moved into their dorms. Alia Kawar (COL ’20) said her negative expectations of Darnall Hall have been disproven.
“When I got the news that I was in Darnall, I thought I was going to be in the worst dorm on campus because of all the complaints I’ve heard from older students,” Kawar said. “But actually living in Darnall has been one of my highlights here at Georgetown because I was able to become part of a close-knit community that cared about each other and was culturally diverse.”
Students in other freshman dorms, like Harbin Hall resident Jaebok Lee (SFS ‘20), said they found it to be a convenient way to meet and make friends.
“There is a huge population that stays in our common room,” Lee said. “I think that is great way to meet new people and make lasting friendships.”
While students in the Class of 2020 seems content with their classes and the sense of community on campus, frustrations run high concerning housing utilities and the slow response time to fixing problems.
“I am a bit frustrated with the facilities,” Pipitone said. “The water is never hot and the taps are slightly broken and make a terrible noise and no one has come to fix it yet.”
According to Audrey Bischoff (COL ’20), food on campus has been satisfactory, particularly the new to-go program at O’Donovan Hall, but bemoan the long lines.
“I am very much a fan of the Leo’s to-go program,” Bischoff said. “But the lines for the spaghetti and wok are always too long.”
Despite the variety of food choices, Cameron Barr (MSB ’20) said the quality of the meals was subpar.
“The wok station is an eight out of ten, the pasta station is a six out of 10 and everything else in Leo’s is a one out of 10,” Barr said.
Georgetown Culture
Besides dorms, freshmen said pre-orientation programs and Hoya Saxa Weekend were key factors in enabling them to make connections on campus.
“Making friends was easy because of international pre-orientation and because people are cool,” Craunot said. “Everyone is so cool and very open minded, at least the people I hang out with.”
According to Pipitone, some international students express that they have not met enough Americans yet and feel slightly isolated because of it.
“I think it’s good that Georgetown is a very international community but at the same time, the international students tend to group with each other,” Pipitone said.
Georgetown did not hold a pre-orientation program for international students this year for the second year in a row in an effort to help international students meet more American students.
Lee said he was shocked by the Georgetown club culture.
“I found it very surprising, the exclusivity of the clubs and how social life is so restricted based on the clubs you engage in,” Lee said.
According to Callia Kharas (COL ’20), the transition to Georgetown has been easier than anticipated.
“Honestly the transition, when I left for college, I thought it was going to be harder then it actually was,” Kharas said.
After an eventful first month, which included appearances by former Gov. Martin O’Malley (D- Md.), Secretary of State John Kerry and 2016 Team USA Olympians, the Class of 2020 is eager to see what the rest of the semester holds.
“Definitely looking forward to the end of the semester —seeing how things turn out, what my grades will be, see how I manage to adapt. I am of course looking forward to going home in between the two semesters.” Manset said. “But I am mainly looking forward to finishing the semester in the same way I started: in a great way, making good friends, building strong relationships and adapting myself to this great lifestyle. Looking forward to what’s about to come.”

The number of students studying abroad has increased from 561 in the 2012-13 year to 684 students in the 2015-16 year, marking a 21.9 percent increase and the highest overall enrollment in the past three years.
Georgetown currently offers study abroad options in 40 countries ranging from Botswana and Cameroon to Tajikistan and Taiwan. Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Denmark and France have remained the most popular study abroad options over the past three years. Hong Kong, China, Argentina and Australia are the most popular choices in regions outside Europe.
According to the Office of Global Education website, 467 students — about two in three — are currently studying abroad in Europe, consistent with the trend in the past three years. Latin America has seen a significant decline in enrollment over the past three years, with the number of students studying in the region falling from 80 in 2012 to 54 in the latest cycle.
Africa and the Middle East/North Africa usually receives the fewest students, though Morocco has seen a steady increase in enrollment from four students each cycle in 2013-14 and 2014-15 to 11 in 2015-16.
Director of Global Education Craig Rinker said the number of students abroad demonstrates the importance of a global perspective in equipping Georgetown students to enter a more connected world.
“We all live in a world of increasing interdependent nations and cultures.  The need to engage with the world has never been greater,” Rinker wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown students must be prepared to live and work in an international environment where they may need to look beyond borders to solve complex world issues. While our students can prepare in part through academic study and open debate, nothing can match direct experience.”
Students in the College make up more than half of students currently studying abroad. The School of Nursing and Health Studies continues to be the least represented school, with 12 students abroad in 2012-13 and 17 in 2015-16.
Meredith Johnson (SFS ’17), who studied abroad last fall in Madrid and now works as a peer adviser for the Office of Global Education, said she preferred to study in Europe because of the ease of travel to other nations.
“I’ve always known I’ve wanted to study abroad,” Johnson said. “I had never been out of the country before I went abroad so I knew I wanted to be in Europe because I wanted to see a bunch of countries in the short amount of time I was abroad.”
Johnson also said the availability of courses that matched her major affected her decision.
“[Spanish universities] had the most classes that would count towards my major whilst directly matriculating into classes with Spanish students,” Johnson said.
Tatiana Hadchiti (MSB ’18), who is currently studying abroad in the business and culture program in Barcelona, said her program balanced her interests in business and the humanities.
“As an International Business and Marketing double major, I thought that studying business abroad would give me a unique opportunity to learn about issues related to these topics through a unique lens,” Hadchiti wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Living in Spain also allows me to enhance my knowledge of the Spanish language and culture and explore a city in a different part of the world.”
Tori Costa (COL ’18), a Spanish and Portuguese major studying at the Complutense University of Madrid, said her study abroad experience is not what she anticipated.
“Studying abroad is a great experience, but I will say it has not met my expectations. Before arriving in Madrid, I thought things would be a lot easier than they turned out to be,” Costa wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown culture often depicts study abroad as a fun, well-deserved break from the daily grind we usually face as students. While in some ways this is true, there is still a lot of learning that goes on outside of the classroom.”
Hadchiti said that Georgetown students tend to spend most of their time with other students studying abroad, reducing opportunities to meet locals
“The majority of my time is spent with Georgetown students and other students I’ve met from different universities. My program consists almost entirely of American students, so it has been a little more difficult to meet local students,” Hadchiti wrote.
Katherine Leopold (COL ’18), who is studying abroad in Copenhagen, said her host family alleviated this issue by enabling her to find a balance between her peers and locals.
“My program has lots of Georgetown students in it. I spend some time with them and some time with other students in the program. Since I am living with a host family, I get to spend a good amount with local Danes everyday,” Leopold wrote.
Hadchiti said she received support at Georgetown prior to studying abroad that prepared her for a living experience in a foreign country.
“The MSB deans were very helpful during the application process and want to ensure that you are well prepared before leaving, in terms of course credits, cultural adjustment and any other issues that could arise,” Hadchiti wrote.
However, Costa said the College preparation did not ensure an easy transition overseas.
“I believe Georgetown did everything possible to equip us before moving overseas, however, I do not believe this is an experience you can truly prepare for,” Costa wrote.

“I thought things would be a lot easier than they turned out to be” – haha, what student was ever surprised with college being easier than they thought? 🙂 going to europe is a big step, but certain countries have a big advantage. if you look through the programs at e.g. https://www.study.eu you find that most universities in some countries don’t charge americans any tuition fee, such as france or norway, if you are doing the full degree there. imagine saving five digits or more on your postgrad!

Referendums are inefficient forms of democracy, according to Former High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs the Right Honourable Baroness Catherine Ashton of Upholland during a discussion at the Mortara Center on Friday.
The talk, co-hosted by the BMW Center for German and European Studies and the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security was moderated by GIWPS Executive Director Melanne Verveer.
Ashton said although democracy is important, referenda may not be the best vehicle to communicate popular opinion. Referenda prevent politicians from offering citizens detailed answers to complex problems, according to Ashton.
“Democracy is very important, but the instruments of democracy should be used wisely and well. I’m not of the view that a referendum is always the best way of showing democracy,” Ashton said. “Straightforward yes-and-no questions lead to slogan solutions rather than in-depth propositions.”
Ashton said there is a possibility for constructive relations between the United Kingdom and the European Union after the United Kingdom formally leaves the EU following its June 23 vote.
“The UK has just voted to leave the European Union, it hasn’t voted to leave the world.” Ashton said. “What is important is not looking at it as disintegration, but looking at it as a new way of working together.”
Ashton, who held the position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy from 2009-2014 – comparable to that of EU foreign minister – said some of reconciling the views of 28 individual member nations into one cohesive foreign policy approach, while still preserving the autonomy of those member states, was a constant challenge.
“You have to recognize that individual nations, when they have aid budgets and foreign ministries, have to prove the worth of those,” Ashton said.
Ashton, who was the first female European Union trade commissioner from 2008 to 2009, said women face significant challenges in politics.
“There is no road map for women. You’re on your own, so tread your own path, and do it with pride,” Ashton said. “Make sure to put the ladder down behind you.”
Ashton served as a chief negotiator in both the normalization of relations between Serbia and Kosovo and the P5 + 1 talks, which included China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany and led to the signing of the Iran nuclear deal in 2013.
Ashton emphasized three core tenets of negotiation as indispensable guidelines when approaching a global challenge: collaboration, the ability to think comprehensively and the importance of thinking long-term.
“You can’t understand one aspect of a crisis without understanding all of the interwoven underpinnings of what’s going on,” Ashton said. “We have to understand that processes take time, and be prepared to invest in that.”
In an interview with The Hoya following the event, Verveer said Ashton’s insights will help students find solutions to world problems as future leaders.
“I think the breadth of her experience, ranging from negotiating the agreement between the Serbs and the Kosovars, to the Iran talks, to her work in so many other trouble spots… what this represents for our students is the chance to sit with someone who has this wealth of experience and to learn lessons that can help us move forward into all the difficult, intractable challenges of tomorrow,” Verveer said.
SFS Events Manager Phoebe Koenigsberg said she welcomed the advice offered by Ashton to women seeking to forge careers in male-dominated industries and institutions.
“As a woman used to being the first at everything that she’s accomplished and done, who didn’t have an example to follow and who had to blaze her own trail – I found that perspective very interesting,” Koenigsberg said.

The next U.S. president should develop a strong but sensitive American presence in Asia, according to a panel of five foreign policy experts in Copley Formal Lounge on Wednesday.
The conversation, which concerned the future of the United States’ Asia policy, is the first event organized by weekly international relations journal The Caravel. Panelists included National Security Council Director of Affairs Michael Green, Chief Bureau Director In-sun Kang of Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo, Brookings Institute Senior Fellow Richard Bush III and State Department Bureau of East Asian Affairs Deputy Assistant Secretary Walter Douglas.
Douglas said that a key component of America’s policy towards Asia will revolve around whether Congress passes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal to loosen trade restrictions between several Asian countries and the United States. Both Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have publicly opposed the deal.
“Going forward, our number one effort in the rebalancing of Asia is to get the TPP approved,” Douglas said. “The president is going to be working hard on that. You’ve seen the news reports and he is calibrating on how he is going to do it. We plan to leave that to the White House.”
According to Douglas, relations between the United States and Asia have been continuously improving through collaboration with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area, the current trade agreement in effect in the region, which the TPP would augment but not replace.
“We now celebrate 40 years of working with ASEAN. Under the Obama administration we placed a mission, like an embassy, to ASEAN in Jakarta and we have an ambassador there,” Douglas said. “We’ve really stepped up relations with ASEAN. Our soft power is such a strong force that people are willing to give us their support even where there is tension in their government’s relations with us.”
Green said the United States must consider its policy toward China as a part of a larger Asia policy and avoid employing simple, blanket theories to guide policy regarding the nation.
“Don’t make the mistake of going for a simplistic description of U.S.-China relations and belief in what China is,” Green said. “It’s more complicated.”
According to Bush, many countries in the region depend on and have good relations with both the United States and China.
“There are many countries in Asia who depend on China economically and so China’s condition is very important to them,” Bush said. “They, however, depend on the U.S. for security.”
Bush said Trump’s proposal for South Korea to receive nuclear weapons to ease the need for United States support at the border with North Korea would be ill-advised, despite potentially reducing the U.S. military budget.
“In the mid-1980s pro-labor Democrats were saying the same thing about Japan, that they are getting a free ride in security. They were wrong then and Donald Trump is wrong now,” Bush said.
The next presidential administration must be proactive when it comes to North Korea, according to Bush.
“Be ready for an early crisis with North Korea. I fully expect that North Korea will want to test the new administration in some way,” Bush said. “The more that can be done in advance of that actuality, the better.”
Green said the United States should appoint foreign policy officials who are very familiar with Asia, given the rising importance of the region for the United States. Previous administrations appointed a disproportionate number of individuals whose focus had always been Europe and NATO allies as representatives to Asia, according to Green.
“The next president has got to appoint secretaries and deputies who really know Asia,” Green said. “You can’t deal with the complexities of the region and create policies accordingly if the hired officials are Atlanticists.”
The Caravel Editor-in-Chief Andrea Moneton (SFS ’18) said events such as the panel will allow the publication to not only report on but also to look critically at foreign policy issues.
“We wanted to host an event and invite expert speakers to campus in order to move from a space where we cover international news and events about international affairs to one where we also participate in shaping the conversation,” Moneton wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Moneton said the event’s focus on Asian foreign policy was chosen as part of a larger effort by the publication to incorporate domestic politics into its work this election cycle, especially given that Asia has been a primary focus of foreign affairs discussions this election season.
“U.S. elections matter to the entire world. That’s especially true with this election cycle, where no U.S. engagements with the international community would be safe should Donald Trump be elected,” Moneton wrote.

Georgetown professors expressed concerns over federal funding for environmental research with the incoming President-elect Donald Trump’s administration.
Trump made multiple comments disputing climate change during his campaign. His selection of Myron Ebell, who denies climate change, to lead his transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency has also raised concerns.
Environmental advocacy group Students for Climate Security led a march against Ebell’s leading the transition team from Red Square to Ebell’s office on L Street on Nov. 18.
Throughout his campaign, Trump has blamed China for making up the theory of climate change as a hoax and pushed to save the coal industry.
Biology professor Gina Wimp’s research on the genetic and environmental factors that affect biodiversity depends heavily on federal funding. Wimp said she is concerned about her funding in light of Trump’s campaign messages.
“Honestly, I feel uncertainty because I really don’t know what Trump is going to do. I feel that I can’t really get a read on it,” Wimp said. “But, the indication I have so far is that he doesn’t seem to really value a lot of scientific research.”
Wimp said if federal funding were to be curtailed, she would not be able to cover the costs of her research. Even with the help of private grants and resources procured by the university, she would have to cut essential aspects of her research.
“That would basically take away my ability to use any sort of molecular analysis in my research, so it would really limit the scope of my research,” Wimp said. “I would have to simply work with things that I can financially afford.”
Biology professor Edward Barrows, who previously served as director of the university’s Center for the Environment, said federal funding for scientific research has been in decline for several years already. Barrows said he is concerned that the incoming administration will further reduce already limited resources.
“Funding is already very limited, and the new administration could make it even more limited,” Barrows wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This would affect that research effort at GU and elsewhere. From the standpoint of GU science students, there could be fewer resources for their research projects. This is worrisome in this era of science and technology.”
Georgetown University Medical Center’s Dean of Research Robert Clarke said cuts in federal funding have already hurt researchers in the past and that future cuts could have negative repercussions.
“Cuts in federal funding for research hurt all of us by slowing and even stalling critical research,” Clarke said. “We have serious issues right now with an aging Baby Boomer population that will experience the silver tsunami of disorders including Alzheimer’s and cancer. We can’t afford to go backwards.”
School of Foreign Service Science, Technology and International Affairs Program Director Mark Giordano said that while Georgetown supports scholars by covering relatively low-cost expenses, it cannot provide higher-end items for research.
“Georgetown in general and the School of Foreign Service in particular has many programs to help support faculty with smaller budget items such as travel and conferences. There is no way it can support the big-ticket items,” Giordano said.
Clarke said some of Georgetown’s funding initiatives are designed to help scholars obtain the federal resources necessary for professors to complete their projects.
“At the medical center, we have a number of community philanthropists called ‘Partners in Research’ who provide seed funding for the exploration of early scientific ideas,” Clarke wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These are critical dollars for researchers to generate data that then helps to apply for larger grants.”
Associate Vice President of Federal Relations Scott Fleming said despite the likelihood of Trump’s administration cutting research funding, the role of multiple government branches and departments in the budget process makes the final outcome unclear.
“President-elect Trump and his team will put together a budget proposal for 2018, and we will once again begin the annual appropriations process,” Fleming said. “When it comes to this budget process, there are a lot of people involved, it is not simply the administration.”
Fleming said the 21st Century Cures Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday, provides a mechanism for continued funding in the area of health care that is independent from the fiscal budget. The act will fund public health programs, new cancer treatments and new treatments to combat the opioid epidemic.
“It is a broadly supported bill. And it would, this money would be there and it would be in this separate account,” Fleming said. “Given the fact that it’s set up in this way and it’s already paid for. It is, to an extent, isolated from the overall budget, because the money is there for that and nothing else.”
Fleming said the university will continue working to ensure that funding reaches scholars in Georgetown no matter the budget.
“With proposals for increases in defense spending and for tax cuts, it is hard to see how the budget is going to play out over the next couple of years,” Fleming said. “I am by nature an optimist, but I am also a realist, so I see the challenges that lie ahead.”
Giordano said while predictions may not be optimistic, it is best to exercise caution when considering the future of research funding under the Trump administration.
“While the signs for research funding are not good, you have to think carefully about predictions,” Giordano said. “The country doesn’t always get what it voted for and sometimes that is good.”

President Donald Trump’s term will consist of four years of policy conflicting with Republicans and Democrats alike, including the renegotiation of free trade agreements, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the building of a border wall, according to Georgetown professors interviewed by The Hoya.
Government professor Michele Swers, whose research focuses on Congress and the role of women in politics, said Trump is poised to clash with Republican leadership in Congress on his stated positions on trade, which contradict typical free trade-oriented Republican policies.
Trump pledged throughout his campaign to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement — a trade deal ratified in 1994 between the United States, Canada and Mexico — and to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement including 12 Pacific Rim countries, the United States and Canada.
“In the past, Republicans have been the more free trade party. [Speaker of the House] Paul Ryan [R-Wis.] has already stated that he’s opposed to placing additional tariffs on our country,” Swers said. “He’s very much a supporter of free trade and trade deals. And so there is going to be some conflict between Trump and some of the free trade Republicans in the House over plans that he has, and I think that he’ll have a difficult time getting tariffs, additional sort of taxes.”
In an interview with The Hoya, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs at the McCourt School of Public Policy Mark Rom, whose research focuses on social welfare policy, said Republicans in Congress may also be skeptical of Trump’s campaign proposal to guarantee six paid weeks of maternity leave for new mothers.
“This is not a typical Republican proposal. This is typically a Democratic proposal. This is a big thing for the Republicans,” Rom said. “I don’t think Congress wants to give him that. Congress doesn’t want to create a national policy of paid maternity child leave.”
However, Rom said he doubts maternity leave is one of Trump’s highest priorities, saying the proposal was primarily inspired by his daughter Ivanka, not Trump himself.
“Mainly it’s coming through Ivanka’s mouth,” Rom said of the policy. “She’s important, so I think it’s probably on his list of things to do, but probably not at the top of the list.”
On health care policy, Rom said the Republican Congress and Trump are unified in their resolve to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. He said that the lack of a replacement plan from the Trump transition team leaves an open question.
“He keeps saying he has a plan and that plan will be revealed soon, but in fact, that plan has not been revealed,” Rom said. “It’s a concept, and the concept is everybody will be covered, it will be great, it won’t cost very much and everybody will have great care. That’s not a plan. That’s nirvana. Until he tells us exactly how he plans to attain nirvana, then we don’t know what he’s really going to do.”
A Congressional Budget Office report released Tuesday said 18 million Americans could lose health insurance if certain parts of the Affordable Care Act, which subsidizes insurance for many Americans, were to be repealed without a replacement.
Dean of Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies Patricia Ann Cloonan said she hopes the benefits of the ACA will continue, regardless of the Republican Congress.
“The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage for millions of people and emphasized the importance of health care providers collaborating with the communities they serve in the delivery of care. More insured individuals and more community engagement are two very good things that I hope will continue,” Cloonan said.
Trump made increasing restrictions on immigration a focal point of his campaign. He called for a full ban on Muslim immigration in December 2015, before beginning to walk back the policy in May 2016. Swers said she expects Trump’s pick for Attorney General Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to help implement a hardline stance on immigration.
“Trump has made immigration a priority issue that he’s talked about a lot,” Swers said. “By appointing Jeff Sessions, who’s also very hard-line on immigration, very law and order, I would expect that they’re going to go after things like sanctuary cities, look to step up deportations. We know that they’re already looking as a way to build his border wall, so that they’ll be focused on those things.”
Swers added that the long-promised border wall between the United States and Mexico looks likely and may not even require any new Congressional action to be built. However, she said it would likely be paid for by U.S. tax dollars first, which contradicts with Trump’s frequent campaign promises that Mexico would pay for the wall. Trump said Jan. 6 that he would ask Congress to pay for the wall, with Mexico paying back the United States at a later date.
Building the wall could cost up to $25 billion, according to The Washington Post. “Right now they’re saying that they’re going to use legislation that had already been passed in previous Congresses related to border security, and then you’re just looking to get funding for the appropriations process,” Swers said. “So that means that we would be paying for it and not Mexico right now.”
Associate government professor Matthew Kroenig, who specializes in international relations and was a foreign policy advisor for former Republican Presidential Candidate Marco Rubio (R-Fl.),  said Trump will take an aggressive foreign policy approach to China, contrasting that of outgoing President Barack Obama. Obama’s foreign policy has been marked by a focus on Asia, including the negotiation of the TPP and the United States’ participation in the regional East Asia Summit.
“Trump has indicated that he plans a tougher approach to China, look[s] to strengthen relations with Taiwan and promise[s] to push back against China’s illegal island building campaign in the South China Sea,” Kroenig wrote in an email to The Hoya. “A move in this direction would be welcome as the Obama administration’s soft approach has allowed Beijing to use coercion to take contested territory from U.S. treaty allies and challenge the rules-based order in Asia.”
Kroenig also said he expects Trump to pursue a friendlier relationship with Russia, but added that this relationship should not preclude holding Russia accountable for the nation’s apparent interference in the presidential election. The Office of the Director on National Intelligence released a report Jan. 6 detailing a Russian campaign to influence the United States election in Trump’s favor.
“Improved relations with Russia is a priority for Trump,” Kroenig said. “There is no doubt that a better relationship with Russia is desirable, but we must also be clear-eyed about the threat Moscow poses and realize that much of the blame for the recent downturn in relations falls squarely on [Vladimir] Putin’s shoulders.”

Washington, D.C., is the fourth-best city to live in the United States based on factors such as quality of life and desirability, according to a study from U.S. News and World Report released Tuesday, despite reports of an increase in racial and economic inequality across the city.
The “2017 Best Places to Live” report placed the District only behind Austin, Texas; Denver, Colo.; and San Jose, Calif. The 100-city ranking consisted of a scoring system that ranked each city out of a total 10 points as an average of five categories. D.C. recorded 7.3 points compared to Austin’s 7.8.
While recognizing that the District’s cost of living is above the national average — with the average cost to buy a home at $371,772 compared to the nation’s average of $211,731 — the report cites the attractions of living in the nation’s capital, including monuments, museums and national landmarks.
Additionally, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s performance, diversity in the city and the cherry blossom season are among the assets listed in the description of life in D.C. included in the report.
“The D.C. population is diverse, with the area’s strong job market attracting people from around the world. Cultural variation can be seen throughout the metro area, from the colorful Chinatown archway to the Ethiopian and Latin American restaurants lining Adams Morgan’s streets,” the report reads.
D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute Executive Director Ed Lazere also noted the vibrancy of the city, but said that the attractiveness of living in the District does not apply equally to all its residents.
“I would say that D.C. is a booming and vibrant city, and that D.C. government has done a lot to invest in the quality of life — schools, libraries, parks, health care and more. But the benefits clearly are not equally shared, and in fact many residents have become victims of D.C.’s growth, rather than beneficiaries,” Lazere wrote in an email to The Hoya. “More families are homeless, more are spending upwards of 80 percent of their income for housing, and incomes are not rising for any group other than college educated residents.”
A December 2016 report from the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that Washington ranks No. 1 in rates of homelessness among the 32 cities it studied, with a significant increase in homelessness between 2009 and 2016. A study from the Urban Institute released in October 2016 called “The Color of Wealth in the Nation’s Capital,” also showed that white households in the District have a net worth that is 81 times greater than that of black households.
Jessica Chilin-Hernández, who works at the Georgetown Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor and advises Alternative Spring Break program Worker Justice D.C., said the District’s historic ties to the black community have been forgotten as gentrification accelerates.
“It is important to remember that D.C. was the first city in our country to have an African American majority. Yet as of 2011, this is no longer the case. Revitalization projects have driven out long-time residents of historically black neighborhoods such as Shaw and Petworth,” Chilin-Hernández wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Rent and property taxes in these neighborhoods have increased dramatically over the last decade.”
The Georgetown neighborhood is an example of the report’s description of the city’s attractiveness due to its residential areas and diverse commercial districts, according to Georgetown Business Improvement District Communications Director Lauren Boston.
“From the historic C&O Canal to unique small businesses on Wisconsin Avenue, world-class shopping on M Street, amazing dining in every direction, and a recreational paradise on the waterfront, Georgetown represents the very best that the city as a whole has to offer,” Boston wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This is a vibrant community, with engaged, caring and happy residents, employees, students, locals and tourists alike.”
U.S. News used indexes on job markets, value, quality of life, desirability and net migration in its ranking. Each factor was weighted in the total score based on a nationwide public survey on the importance of each.
The job market index, which accounted for 20 percent of the total score, included the unemployment rate and average salary. The value index looked at blended median annual household income and blended annual cost of living and made up 25 percent of the score. The quality of life index was 30 percent of the score and included the factors of crime rates, quality and availability of health care, quality of education, well-being and commute time. The desirability index was 15 percent of the total score while net migration into D.C. was 10 percent.
Surveys like U.S. News’ do not take into account the quality of life of all D.C. residents, according to Eliza McCurdy (COL ’17), who participated in a project with Carlo Izzo (COL ’17) as part of their “Research Methods in Justice and Peace” class to outline the dangers that homeless residents face when temperatures drop. They collaborated with the Center for Social Justice and the Georgetown Ministry Center to create an interactive map of services in the District for individuals experiencing homelessness.
“Clearly reports like that ask only about the quality of life of residents who have permanent addresses. In fact, most of our Georgetown community only consider property owners to be our neighbors,” McCurdy wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Izzo added that the U.S. News report overlooks the areas of the District that are seen as less desirable to live in. While the report cites public transport in D.C. as above the national average in terms of commute time, Izzo said Metro does not serve all residents equally.
“In terms of transportation, there’s one Metro stop in Wards 7 and 8 so I think it’s interesting what parts of the city people actually care about getting to and what parts people don’t,” Izzo said. “Whenever people think about it, they always think of the monuments and politics and I think they completely ignore the rest of the city, which is the parts of the city that obviously aren’t the ‘best places to live,’ aren’t being gentrified, all those other things.”
According to Chilin-Hernández, to counter the inequality in D.C., policy must account for the differences in marginalized communities living in the District.
“Any policy that seeks to address housing must by default also address, disability, family structure, racial and gender disparities,” Chilin-Hernández said.

The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library, Washington, D.C.’s central library, will close March 4 until 2020 to undergo a $208 million complete modernization.
The project plans to add an estimated 100,000 square feet of additional space. The D.C. Public Library organization plans to maintain various services provided by the MLK Library over the course of the renovation at the 25 other branches located throughout the city.
While the exterior and first floor of the library, which is located in central Chinatown at 9th and G streets NW, will remain untouched, the new design includes a transparent entryway, a large auditorium and conference center, creative spaces for music production and art creation, a ground-level café, a double-height reading room, a rooftop event space and newly designed spaces for special collections and research.
According to D.C. Public Libraries Media Relations Manager George Williams, the new design will allow for greater community building and more interaction among library patrons.
“There aren’t a lot of buildings in the District that bring residents together. The modernized Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library is going to do that,” Williams said. “It will be a state-of-the-art, centrally located civic hub for all D.C. residents to create, learn, relax and, of course, read.”
The new design was spearheaded by award-winning Martinez+Johnson Architecture, a D.C.-based firm, and Mecannoo, an award-winning Dutch firm. The selection process began in August 2013 with 26 firms applying for the project.
The firms have been approved by the National Capital Planning Commission, the D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts.
According to Martinez+Johnson Architecture Co-Founder and Principal Thomas Johnson, the conception for the planned design came from a desire to modernize the building, which originally opened in 1972.
“The design has always sought to make the library not only more legible and accessible, but to make it an exciting destination place for a wide band of citizens,” Johnson wrote. “Libraries are about access to information be it through books, periodicals or electronic media, and MLK will always be about that. In our century, we have only begun to use libraries as incubators, workshops and meeting places.”
The library has sought community input in the process since the fall of 2013 by convening an advisory panel of community stakeholders, hosting eight citywide community meetings to share the latest designs, conducting focus groups and surveys with local residents and encouraging public comments through their “MLK Jr. Library Idea Community” portal.
Williams said the planning process included more than 70 planning meetings, 13 focus groups, hundreds of surveys and the input of over 4,000 people, both online and in person.
“Because of feedback from the public, we have a library that will serve District residents now and well into the future,” Williams said.
Johnson said their design was based on four principles — creating space for new technology, upgrading building systems, conserving the historical significance of the building and enriching the influence and memory of Martin Luther King Jr.
The firms designed their four-principle approach in coordination with public comment from the Ward 2 community, library staff and other libraries around the world. Johnson cited the vision of the original architect, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, as integral to their plans, though they plan on focusing on modernization.
Johnson attributed the idea for a great reading room spanning the third and fourth floors to ideas from the public.
“Although we didn’t always agree, we did more often than not, and had wonderful discussions about the widest range of issues, and many suggestions were carefully considered and incorporated,” Johnson wrote.
The renovations also plans to showcase the life of Martin Luther King Jr. by respecting the historic designation of the original building design and creating an open and welcoming space.
While the library is closed, it is taking several measures to ensure that patrons have continued access to library resources, including Washingtoniana Collection, which contains historical documents and books documenting the development of the District.
According to Williams, a planned retail location called Library Express will open 1990 K St. NW to provide services such as the Adult Literacy Resource Center and the Center for Accessibility.
All other locations plan to extend their hours, increase the number of computers in their labs and house most of the library’s collections, DVDs and CDs.

Thousands of immigrants and immigration advocates across the United States participated in a national strike Thursday to protest President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.
The protests, collectively called the “Day without Immigrants,” originally gained traction on social media, informally organized on Facebook and WhatsApp, an instant messaging service.
Organizers said the protests attempted to show the effects of immigrant communities on U.S. companies and local businesses.
In Washington, D.C., the protests had the most significant influence on the restaurant industry, with dozens of restaurants closing their doors for the day.
The Architect of the Capitol, which manages the food and support staff for the Capitol building congressional offices, announced that it would function on a modified schedule to accommodate staff participating in the protests.
According to The Washington Post, nearly 48 percent of restaurant workers are foreign-born in the District area.
Sweetgreen, a salad restaurant chain, closed all 20 of its locations in D.C. The restaurant Busboys and Poets also closed its locations in solidarity with the movement.
Celebrity chef José Andrés closed a few of his District area restaurants in support of the immigrant community. Andrés is currently involved in litigation against Trump after going back on an agreement to open a restaurant in the recently opened Trump International Hotel in D.C. because of Trump’s comments about Mexican immigrants on the campaign trail.
Katie Hurd, a spokesperson for Andrés’ ThinkFoodGroup, said the company closed restaurants to support workers who wanted to participate in protests. Oyamel, Zaytinya and the three locations of Jaleo all closed for the day. Hurd said a number of restaurants remained open during the day.
“In solidarity with the many immigrants on our staff who are passionate about participating in A Day Without Immigrants, ThinkFoodGroup will close most of its DC-area restaurants on Thursday, February 16,” Hurd wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“China Chilcano, minibar/barmini and all locations of Beefsteak will remain open, staffed by a collective team from all of our D.C.-area restaurants so that we can continue to both serve our guests as well as provide for those of our staff who plan to work that day,” Hurd wrote.
The protests also affected District schools. The Latin American Montessori Bilingual Public Charter School closed on Thursday due to protests.
District Public Schools Chief of Schools John Davis emailed DCPS administrators earlier this week in anticipation of the protests, saying that although students and staff have the right to protest, they were still required to come to schools Thursday.
“DCPS schools are and will continue to be safe places for all students and all people in our communities, regardless of immigration status, race, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression,” Davis wrote. “We highly value and are committed to fostering a learning environment where staff and students feel safe and secure and we respect the right to self-expression and peaceful protest.”
Iranian immigrant Ahmad Erfani also told WAMU, American University’s radio station, he was closing his bakery, La Caprice, for the demonstrations.
“They are hard workers,” Erfani said. “I am not happy when I see they are not very happy these days, because it is difficult. They work hard, they come here [at] six in the morning.”
Clarissa Martínez-de-Castro, the deputy vice president at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy organization, told The Washington Post the demonstrations presented an inspiring image for immigrant communities.
“In a time when the administration doesn’t seem to see anything positive about the immigrant community, having small-business owners, chefs and their workers challenge that notion and give voice to the very real ways immigrants contribute to society is very significant,” Martinez said.

States must understand the linkages between climate change and security to foster better cooperation in climate change efforts, according to five international affairs experts at a summit in Gaston Hall on April 6.
The conference, organized by the Georgetown Initiative for Diplomatic Engagement and the School of Foreign Service, brought together five international practitioners to evaluate both the progress and future of international cooperation in mitigating climate change.
The summit, part of a series of events commemorating the upcoming SFS centennial anniversary, opened with a keynote address from former National Security Adviser Gen. James L. Jones (SFS ’66), who underscored the role of today’s diverse military methods in controlling climate-induced conflict.
“I will submit that the nexus between climate change and national security is the case study in the evolving nature of threats to which our country and our allies must adjust,” Jones said. “A new and more complicated global environment demands that we modernize our national security thinking.”
One of the priorities that must be at the forefront of this modernization, Jones said, “is updating the U.S. national security architecture and strategy to account for the pivotal role of food and energy, sufficiency and climate — and even human dignity — will play in our present and future of security.”
Jones, who led the United States’ military tours in Afghanistan and Iraq under former President Barack Obama from 2009 until 2010, also warned against the dangers of ideology when coupled with climate-induced conflict.
“The reality is that extreme poverty and extreme ideology make a lethal cocktail,” Jones said. “This interplay causes major challenges to every single one of our United States institutions stationed overseas.”
A panel of ambassadors examined recent efforts to reduce the adverse consequences of climate change following James’ address. The discussion included Ambassador of Barbados to the United States Selwin Hart, Ambassador of Denmark to the United States Lars Gert Lose and Ambassador of Germany to the United States Peter Wittig, and was moderated by Senior Vice President of the Center for Strategic and International Studies Kathleen Hicks.
In their opening remarks, the ambassadors explained the situation of their respective countries and their position vis-a-vis the international climate change regime, which is currently governed by the 2015 Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The Paris Agreement was ratified at the 21st Conference of Parties in Paris in April 2016 and focused on individualized commitments to reducing carbon emissions from 55 signatory nations as opposed to a one-size-fits-all solution.
Wittig emphasized the role Germany played in addressing climate change during its one-month rotating term as president of the United Nations Security Council.
“I decided that I wanted to introduce this topic of climate change and its repercussions on international peace and security,” Wittig said. “It’s not self-evident that it can be introduced on the agenda of the Security Council.”
Along with a bloc of African nations and small island developing states, Wittig helped to negotiate a UN Security Council presidential statement calling on states to address the threat of climate in conflict.
Lose said the 1973 oil crisis in Denmark, in which the country’s oil industry faced a sudden supply shock, is evidence of the effects of climate change on the economy and security.
“We had the major oil crisis and it spurred a security concern in Denmark because back then, 99 percent of our energy consumption was covered by imported fossil fuels and it led to a major economic recession,” Lose said. “We had major unemployment; we even had car-free Sundays and — trust me — this is when it became a security issue.”
Lose also emphasized the disproportionate effect of climate change on indigenous people living in Greenland. Though an autonomous constituent country, Greenland has been politically associated with the Kingdom of Denmark for more than a millennium.
“If you’re ever in doubt whether climate change is real go to Greenland, go to the arctic,” Lose said. “The ice cap is receding, ice poles are melting and this is completely changing the livelihoods of the indigenous population up there.”
Barbados has been hit especially hard by climate change due to its geography as a low-lying small island in the Caribbean, according to Hart.
“Ninety percent of all economic activity takes place within 1 mile of the coast line. So therefore, sea level rise, the increase in frequency of extreme weather events, has a devastating impact on the Caribbean,” Hart said. “And for those who think climate change is some future event, I’m here to say it’s happening now and it is getting worse.”
Hart also said state defense against climate change comes with a significant price tag.
“Nineteen of the major cities in the Caribbean are extremely vulnerable to sea level rise and for us to protect those cities it will require building 300 kilometers of sea walls and levees costing over $4.5 billion with an annual estimated maintenance cost of over $150 million,” Hart said. “These are resources that could be invested in health, education and other social goods.”
Collaboration from other countries with U.S. leadership has been vital to advancing the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement, according to Hart.
“There is no other country that can drive innovation and technological change and development like the United States,” Hart said. “I’m hopeful the new administration will weigh the costs and benefits of its leadership and participation in this universal global move towards addressing climate change.”
The panelists also addressed the increased involvement of China on the international stage.
“China is very assertive in wanting to assume a leadership role,” Wittig said. “If the United States thinks of leaving its position, then China will step into the room and will act as a leading protagonist in the climate policy.”
According to Hart, it is in the global interest for the United States to maintain its involvement in climate change efforts.
“It is very concerning — and I can’t say this diplomatically — that there is this consideration of the United States not participating in the implementation of the Paris Agreement or developing the rulebook for the Paris Agreement,” Hart said. “We want the United States at the table to ensure that those rules remain strong.”

President Donald Trump is challenging standing trade rules and agreements, but the extent to which he will continue to do so is uncertain, according to the speakers at the International Trade Under Trump event in Healy Hall on April 25.
The event, hosted by the Alexander Hamilton Society, featured panelists Michael Smart, former director for international trade on the National Security Council, and Rodney Ludema, Georgetown professor of economics and former chief economist of the U.S. Department of State. Georgetown professor of government Robert Lieber moderated the event.
Lieber introduced the panel and said Trump’s policies have been characterized by a populist spirit.
“The issues and positions that [Trump] took during the election campaign were highly controversial,” Lieber said. “The positions he and his administration have adopted since that time often represent considerable changes from what transpired during the campaign, like the impulses of nationalism and populism which were expressed by President Trump during the campaign and were expressed by many of his supporters and voters.”
Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump criticized existing trade deals and proposed expansions to the free trade regime former President Barack Obama pursued during his term. POLITICO first reported Trump was considering signing an executive order to initiate the United States’ withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement, a multilateral deal between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. that removes tariffs on trade between the three nations.
The White House announced Wednesday night it would not withdraw from NAFTA, but would move “swiftly” to renegotiate the agreement, after calls from Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and other Republican senators not to withdraw.
Ludema said the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s actions will have a negative impact on international trade.
“I think it’s part of the problem from an economic standpoint that we really don’t know the answers to these questions, and that’s actually by itself extremely bad for international trade. International trade relies on investments. Uncertainty itself kills that,” Ludema said. “We’re already in this protectionist climate simply because of the guessing game between Donald Trump’s rhetoric on the one hand, and what he’ll actually do.”
Lieber noted that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a major U.S.-led trade agreement in Asia. Former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did so as well, though after calling the agreement the “gold standard” in 2012.
The TPP was a multilateral trade agreement between 11 Asian, North and South American countries including the United States that reduced tariffs and other barriers to free trade between the 12 nations, and included a mechanism for countries to settle commercial disputes.
Lieber said this opposition from both sides of the political spectrum demonstrated the challenges free trade proponents faced during the presidential campaign.
“The challenges to an open political trading regime become very evident well before the election,” Lieber said.
Smart noted Trump’s criticism of existing trade agreements, namely NAFTA, which Trump had criticized and signaled support for a potential withdrawal before announcing he would not withdraw after the event, as he approaches his 100th day in office.
“What do we see as we approach the 100-day mark of the administration? Well, I think what you see is a deceleration of his ambition to get out there and renegotiate,” Smart said.
The Trump administration is receiving significant pushback from trading partners and the private sector, according to Smart. Smart added the administration may face difficulties negotiating with other parties to the agreements.
“I think one of the biggest flaws in the thinking of this administration is that the U.S. has all the leverage — when we say we want to renegotiate and essentially set the terms. And while the U.S. does have a lot of leverage, the other side has some too. I think they’re starting to discover that,” Smart said.
Smart also said the administration has signaled intent to use trade remedies, including the pursuit of antidumping and safeguard policies, even more so than previous administrations. Throughout his campaign, Trump signaled support for stricter World Trade Organization regulation of Chinese economic policy.
“The United States has never been bashful about using these trade remedies; to listen to the campaign rhetoric, you’d think that they were.” Smart said. “But the administration came in and they were even more determined to be even more aggressive — and China is really their target.”
Ludema said he believes the administration’s protectionist campaign rhetoric will be limited by its powers under current World Trade Organization rules.
“I expect reality to come crashing in and I expect rationality to prevail. As a result, what I think is going to happen is that in order to make good on campaign promises, the Trump administration is going to have to take some protectionist actions,” Ludema said, “[But] they’ll do those things that are already legal to do under existing rules.”
Smart said he is less hopeful about the administration’s harm to the present system and order.
“The more aggressive use of trade remedies is something this administration is absolutely going to do,” Smart said. “About half of all WTO decisions have been about trade remedies, and so the way we administer these rules has come under heavy international scrutiny.”

Georgetown’s admissions yield for the Class of 2021 jumped to 49 percent this year, following a record low in the university’s acceptance rate and an all-time high in applications received.
The university’s admissions yield refers to the number of accepted students who submit an enrollment deposit and plan to attend Georgetown in the fall. This year’s rate is a two-percent increase from last year’s 47 percent.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions’ target enrollment for the entire Class of 2021 increased this year for the first time in seven years to 1,600, up 20 spots from last year. Out of the 3,310 students offered admission for the Class of 2020, 1,633 enrolled, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69).
Deacon said the increase in the yield rate is a positive sign for the university, given the record number of applications Georgetown received this year.
With 1,633 students already enrolled, Deacon projects that around 40 students will be accepted from the waiting list. Currently, about 75 of 100 students offered a spot on a wait list remain. All students will receive a final answer by the end of June.
“We have already made some activity on the waiting list,” Deacon said. “We have admitted 25 people from the waiting list. Last year at this time, it was 80. So therefore, one of the results of having a better yield is having few spaces left for the waiting list.”
The admissions office received 21,459 regular decision applicants to the Class of 2021, up 7.3 percent from the 19,997 applicants Georgetown received in 2016. Georgetown later accepted a record-low 15.4 percent of applicants, an overall 3,310 students.
Deacon said the university offered enrollment to 1,675 students, anticipating about 75 admitted students to defer or withdraw their place because of a gap year, illness or financial constraints.
The incoming class represents every state except North Dakota and a record 172 black students, up 30 from last year. The number of Asian students and Hispanic students also increased from 206 to 227 and 169 to 183, respectively.
The incoming class’ average SAT scores increased to 1411, up eight points from last year, representing a highly accomplished incoming class.
“Considering the fact that the pool went up and the class being enrolled is 1411 in SAT versus 1403 — that’s eight points higher — it’s a stronger group, but our yield was higher,” Deacon said in an interview with The Hoya. “So that is really good, and the result is very few waitlist admits.”
Deacon also reported high yield rates in students admitted to the Community Scholars Program, a five-week academic summer program for first-generation college students, and the Georgetown Scholarship Program, a university program that provides financial support for over 625 undergraduates, many of whom are first-generation students, through access to resources and support networks.
The CSP reported a 75 percent yield, with 15 more students planning to enroll than expected, while 67 percent of students admitted to GSP and offered the program’s 1789 Scholarship, which offsets the cost of attendance usually covered by a student loan, plan to enroll.
“I don’t know if the word is out that Georgetown has a great program, but that’s the area that we did really well in,” Deacon said.
The number of foreign nationals enrolling in fall 2017 decreased slightly to 125 from last year’s 127.
Deacon said this small drop raises flags about future changes in international students considering Georgetown for higher education.
“The only number that didn’t tick up was the number of foreign nationals which is an interesting story — 125 versus 127. It didn’t go way down, but it didn’t go up,” Deacon said. “There’s been this issue about whether the climate in the country is going to impact at all the number of foreign nationals who want to come here. That number is interesting.”
Deacon said international student enrollment and applications have traditionally been driven by residents of China as a result of strong economic growth and interest in U.S. education, especially during the time span between 2004 and 2014 in which Georgetown saw a significant jump in international applications. Still, as Chinese interest in Georgetown slows, Deacon said the admissions office is looking to other Asian countries to attract.
“The large jump from 2004 to 2014 was largely influenced by China, and Asia in general. The economy in China is contracting; the growth there is probably peaking,” Deacon said. “Next is India, so we’re spending more time travelling to India. That population is particularly attuned to high-tech areas, and since we don’t have engineering, that’s probably going to limit how big a jump that will be for us.”
The total size of the student body will not change and remains tied to the 2010 Campus Plan’s 6,675 undergraduate student enrollment cap, meaning the admissions office shifted to accepting more freshmen than transfer students this cycle to fill the additional 20 seats in the Class of 2021. This increase reduced the number of transfer students accepted this year from 170 to 150 admits.
The undergraduate schools reported steady yields, with the McDonough School of Business recording the highest rate of 54 percent. The School of Foreign Service reported a 51 percent yield, the School of Nursing and Health Studies recorded a 49 percent yield and Georgetown College yielded 45 percent of its applicants.
Deacon said the MSB’s yield rate has leveled, mirroring the similar trend the MSB observed over the past two years in steady applicant numbers.
He said the lack of substantial growth in yield or applications for the MSB could reflect a shift in applicants’ interest for the humanities and social sciences, as Georgetown College experienced a bump in applicants this cycle, and a stabilizing job market and improving national economic environment.
“The pressure students were facing after the financial crisis was going into a program where they could get jobs afterward,” Deacon said. “It seems that that may be reversing a little bit. People see there is more uncertainty than there used to be. So committing to something fully as opposed to being just generally well-educated is something people are beginning to think about.”

Alfredo Carrillo is a staff writer for The Hoya.
Democracy can successfully develop in any country over time as long as strong institutions uphold freedom and equality, argued former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during the signing of her latest book Saturday at the National Book Festival hosted in the Walter E. Washington Convention Center.
In a conversation with David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-CEO of The Carlyle Group, Rice, a professor at Stanford University since 2009, reflected on the ways her upbringing in the segregated city of Birmingham, Ala., and her career as Secretary of State influenced her ideas about democracy.
Rice said the topic of her book, “Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom,” which became a New York Times’ best-seller less than a month after being published, bore a deep connection with her identity.
“In many ways, I wanted to write this book for a long time because it is in some ways an expression of my own life,” Rice said.
She said that her story — a black girl growing up in a segregated city who rose to serving as former President George W. Bush’s Secretary of State from 2005 to 2009 and National Security Adviser from 2001 to 2005 — embodied the potential of the Constitution’s values.
“This same Constitution that had once counted in the compromise, my ancestors’ three-fifths of a man, would be the same Constitution to which I took the oath of office as the 66th Secretary of State,” Rice said. “That for me is the story of democracy.”
Rice said this form of slow progress should not be exclusive to the United States, based on the lessons her role as chief diplomat taught her.
Rice rejected stereotypical claims that certain cultures are not capable of maintaining democratic governments, pointing to achievements of democratic states around the world.
“The Asians were too Confucian, but of course you’ve got South Korea, you’ve got Japan. The Africans, well they were too tribal, but of course you’ve got Ghana, you’ve got Botswana,” Rice said. “African Americans, well, they were too childlike to care about that thing called voting. But we’ve had a black president, black attorneys general, we’ve had black secretaries of state,” Rice said. “I just reject this cultural argument.”
Referring to Russia, Rice argued, that the country’s 70-year Soviet history never allowed for such institutions to emerge in the first place.
“Really, it’s the story of the failure of institutions to take hold under enormous pressure,” Rice said. “If you think about the collapse of the Soviet Union and you think about the kind of rapid effort to build capitalism, 50 percent of the Russian population fell into poverty practically overnight. The country broke apart practically overnight.”
She contrasted Russia’s political and economic woes with those of Poland, Colombia and even the United States, in which existing institutions facilitated the emergence of true democracy.
“When Martin Luther King and others took on the struggle, they weren’t asking America to be something else. They were saying, ‘America, be what you say you are,’” Rice said. “Now, you’re in a much stronger position when you have the institutions in place and you can appeal to those institutions.”
Rice said countries like Iraq, for which Rice advised Bush’s foreign policy, Afghanistan, Egypt, Venezuela, North Korea and China will require more development for democratic institutions to consolidate.
“The worst situation is when you have a cult of personality, tyrannical leader where everything had been at the service of that leader. That was Saddam Hussein,” Rice said in reference to Iraq. “And so there were effectively no institutions underneath him.”
However, Rice said certain developments within these countries, like Saudi women becoming more educated, Iraqi civilians defeating ISIS and establishing democratic institutions, and China being exposed to the rest of the world through trade, provide hope for democracy’s growth.
Rice acknowledged that mistakes were made during her tenure as Secretary of State that impeded smooth democratic transitions in foreign countries like Iraq after the invasion in 2003, but emphasized an active role for the United States to spread freedom.
“I think America is at its best, its highest calling when it leads both from power and principle,” Rice said. “When we stand for the proposition that the rights to be enjoyed are indeed universal, and if they are universal, that there are no people for whom they shouldn’t be secured.”

Foreign policy experts hashed out strategies to combat the rise of nuclear proliferation in rogue states, including more aggressive actions against North Korea, at an event hosted by the Alexander Hamilton Society Wednesday evening.
Former Pentagon official Michael Rubin and newly appointed Vice Dean of Georgetown College David Edelstein discussed the successes and failures of previous U.S.-led initiatives and forecasted future possibilities during a panel hosted by government professor Matthew Kroenig.
While the scholars agreed on more fronts than they disagreed, Rubin said the overreliance on diplomacy with rogue states is a culturally misinformed and Western tactic. He suggested that diplomatic measures should be coupled with military options.
“What I want to cast doubt on is this idea that diplomacy always works, and that it never hurts to talk,” Rubin said. “It becomes a mantra among both Democrats and Republicans, yet I would argue that it can be very condescending and culturally insensitive to engage with a sort of mirror-imaging that assumes that everyone approaches diplomacy the same way.”
Edelstein cautioned against the use of military force, emphasizing the limitations of American will in the international arena.
“If the alternative to diplomacy is the use of military force, then we should be reluctant and awfully careful about that alternative. Limited strikes may be able to set back nuclear programs, but at the same time they may only increase the incentive of those states to acquire nuclear weapons,” Edelstein said. “There are limits to even what the world’s most powerful country can accomplish.”
Turning to North Korea’s nuclear program, Rubin and Edelstein made clear that it is not in China’s interests to play the role of watchdog that the United States hopes it will. U.S. foreign policy goals have long focused on preventing North Korea from developing a nuclear warhead able to strike the United States and its allies.
“We thought we would see sincerity from China; we gave them a great deal of incentives in terms of technology and waivers and so forth. Just like the return address for Hezbollah is in Tehran, maybe we have to assume the return address of Pyongyang is in Beijing,” Rubin said.
Edelstein said China continues to benefit from U.S. unwillingness to act on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.
“Anybody who thinks China is our friend in dealing with North Korea is delusional. The Chinese are quite content to see this issue as a continual thorn in our side,” Edelstein said.
Chinese leaders would only consider a more active role if the regional balance of power were upset, Rubin said.
“I would say we need to talk with Japan, and have the Japanese — who are more concerned about North Korea than even we are — about the possibility of new constitutions, and whether or not, in the spirit of deterrence, maybe it’s time for Japan to reconsider whether it should possess a nuclear weapon,” Rubin said.
Recognizing the instability expected by the emergence of a new nuclear power, Edelstein said a nuclear Japan could bring dangerous, unintended consequences.
“Decades of research show us that the period in which there are new nuclear states is a really dangerous period in international politics,” Edelstein said. “That new state is worried that they may not have many of those things, and it doesn’t yet have the secure second-strike capabilities that we relied on in the Cold War to have that deterrent relationship.”
Rubin suggested regime change should be the end goal of American policy toward North Korea “before the problem gets so much worse.”
The best way to avoid international nuclear conflict would be to rely on deterrence and eschew aggression toward North Korea, Edelstein said.
“My sense is that if [China’s] goal is to keep the regime in power, then the best way to prevent the North Koreans from actually thinking about using these nuclear weapons is by saying, ‘You know what, maybe we just can’t change this regime right now,’” Edelstein said.

The sheer amount of data flooding national security agencies poses both challenges and opportunities to the intelligence community, argued the nation’s top geospatial intelligence experts at a conference Sept. 14.
Returning for its fourth year, the George T. Kalaris Intelligence Conference hosted by Georgetown University and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency gathered government officials, scholars, students and featured NGA Director Robert Cardillo (GRD ’88) and Major General Linda Urrutia-Varhall, NGA director of operations.
The conference, “Global Intelligence Trends: Embracing Paradigm Shifts,” featured a panel of guests who analyzed the way increased access to larger and more varied datasets is changing how the United States acquires and uses intelligence.
Georgetown Center for Security Studies Director Bruce Hoffman said the three panels featured as part of the event addressed the potential advantages and difficulties posed by the transition to increasingly data-based intelligence work.
“The big paradigm shift was big data, and how to harness the information revolution and both the potentialities that it has in doing intelligence better, but also the challenges of just dealing with this onslaught of information that intelligence analysts and operators have to wade through,” Hoffman said in an interview with The Hoya.
Cardillo said the spread of information through the internet has changed the role of the NGA, a national security intelligence agency dedicated to mapping and geographical intelligence.
“We find ourselves in quite an interesting global landscape, and we could touch any part of that globe and talk about the challenges and the opportunities that exist,” Cardillo said. “For my profession, in my agency, it imposes a particular responsibility, one in which we need to apply our capabilities in ways that inform those that rely upon us.”
Hoffman said that, just as data can be used for intelligence operations, it can also be used by U.S. adversaries to radicalize populations and undermine the U.S. agenda.
“A lot of the technology that, in the 20th century, was in the domain of governments has migrated to the world at large,” Hoffman said. “So it’s benefited the general public and broad populations, but it’s also been seized upon by the terrorists as a weapon to use against us.”
Hoffman said Islamist terrorist groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria demonstrate how technology and big data have spread to more than just American allies.
“ISIS now is using commercial, off-the-shelf drones to drop bombs,” Hoffman said. “They’re not like the Predator, or the Reaper, which are very sophisticated UAVs. But nonetheless, they’re aping us, which I think underscores that terrorism doesn’t occur in a vacuum, and sometimes leverages off of developments in society.”
Urrutia-Varhall analyzed how the intelligence community has evolved, saying larger amounts of information have allowed agents to focus on multiple issues.
“When I came in, I looked at the world, and it was a puzzle. And I had a piece of a puzzle that went into one specific location. For intel right now, it’s a mosaic,” Urrutia-Varhall said in an interview with The Hoya. “I am looking at terrorism. I am looking at North Korea. I’m looking at Russia doing an exercise. I’m looking at the technology for China. I’m looking at Iran missiles. I’m looking at Boko Haram, who’s kidnapped some young girls.”
Despite the potential of technology and data, understaffing in the intelligence community has limited agencies’ abilities, Urrutia-Varhall said.
“The resources, they’re going down,” Urrutia-Varhall said. “Doesn’t matter whether it’s a civilian agency. It doesn’t matter whether it’s the military. We have less people to do more work.”
Urrutia-Varhall said that obtaining data is the first step in analyzing it to determine its authenticity and usefulness.
“It’s not the race to collect big data. It’s the race to make sense of that big data,” Urrutia-Varhall said. “And now we’re on an even playing field, with commercial imagery. It’s shareable, and it’s plentiful. Well, guess what? The image I’m getting, the terrorist is getting the same thing. They could be feeding that image. How do I, at NGA, ensure that’s real? That that’s not a decoy?”
Still, this challenge should not deter the United States from leading the fight against threats through the use of information, Urrutia-Varhall said.
“As the U.S., we can’t give up our time to lead. We have to empower our international partners to step forward, so that we become — we do this together, because nobody’s going to fight alone anymore,” Urrutia-Varhall said.

Brightly colored bicycles have been popping up on street corners and curbs around Washington, D.C., in the past week, as various companies like Spin, LimeBike and JUMP have rolled out new dockless bike-share programs.
Unlike other bike-share programs that require users to leave bikes at designated docks, these bikes are tracked by GPS and can be left nearly anywhere in the city after each use.
Among the companies to unveil this new program is China-based company Mobike. D.C. is the first city in the United States where Mobike has introduced this program.
“We are thrilled to call Washington D.C. Mobike’s first home in North America,” Mobike CEO Hu Weiwei said in a press release. “We look forward to working with more cities across the nation to make cycling the most convenient, affordable, and environmentally friendly transportation option for residents and tourists alike.”
The bikes were modified to best fit the needs of D.C. cyclists, with several gears added and the shape of the bikes altered. One key component is the bikes’ built-in GPS functions that serve as a theft-prevention device, in addition to making it convenient for users to track the location of the bicycles.
In order to use the bikes, users must scan a QR code from the Mobike app, unlocking the front wheel. In order to return the bike, users simply slide a lever to lock the bike after parking it at an appropriate location.
Mobike and other dockless bike-share programs offer an alternative to Capital Bikeshare, a bike-sharing program with docking stations located around the city, including one outside the front gates of the university. Renting a Capital Bikeshare bike costs $2 for 30 minutes, compared to $1.50 for 30 minutes for a Mobike bike. However, if users park their Mobike bikes incorrectly, fines could reach up to $100 per half hour.
Some D.C. residents are excited about the prospect of a dockless bike program. Lainey Giles (COL ’20) said that she has used Capital Bikeshare on warm days to get around the city, but had trouble finding a location to dock the bikes.
“What was frustrating about it was it was very difficult to find a place to return them. My friends and I tried several different stations and they were all full with people backed up, waiting to return bikes,” Giles said.
Giles said that she would be more likely to use bikes as a means of transportation if she did not have to worry about finding a place to dock them.
“I know that right now I would be hesitant to use Capital Bikeshare again, especially on a day when I thought that it would be really heavily used. But if I knew that I would have a place where I could definitely return it, I would be much more likely to use it again,” Giles said. “I think that if this new system works, it’s really promising and I think that it would be a really exciting change.”
Mobike has said that they hope to expand their U.S. presence beyond D.C. in the future.
“We are working with a number of cities across the country and are confident this successful pilot will be the first of many partnerships, allowing us to make cycling the most convenient and affordable choice for transportation all around America,” Mobike U.S. General Manager Rachel Song said in a press release.

The year-old Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has overcome other multilateral development banks’ failures to adapt to the rise of emerging economies unlike established western financial institutions, AIIB Vice President of Policy and Strategy Joachim von Amsberg said in a Wednesday lecture.
Headquartered in Beijing, the AIIB is a development bank working to expand and build infrastructure in Asian-Pacific nations.
Von Amsberg, who formerly served as vice president of development finance at the World Bank, said long-standing multilateral development banks such as the World Bank have failed to reform their governance and structure to reflect the rise of emerging economies.
“It has been increasingly difficult to adjust the governance of existing institutions to that changing weight of economies in the world,” von Amsberg said at the lecture co-sponsored by the Asian Studies Program, the Georgetown Anti-Poverty Society, and the Master of Science in Foreign Service Program.
Von Amsberg also noted that some Western G-7 countries, which drove the creation of institutions like the World Bank and currently hold large amounts of their shares within them, are reluctant to give up their position and influence of leadership on these banks.
By contrast, only 25 percent of the AIIB’s shares are held by non-Asian countries. China holds 25 percent and the remaining 50 percent is owned by other Asian states, which make up the rest of the bank’s 80-country membership.
Von Amsberg said that, despite its significant position, China cannot act as a dominant player within the institution.
“Of course it’s very important that [China] is our largest shareholder,” von Amsberg said. “But it’s not dominant, and, in fact, it can always be outvoted by other shareholders, which I think is a very important part of the multinational governance.”
Von Amsberg said this distribution was the result of commitments from the AIIB to ensure true multinational governance and high-quality standards for investing, prompting Asian and European partners to join the bank in 2015 despite U.S. pressure. This downplayed earlier concerns over Chinese President Xi Jinping’s intentions to use the bank to undermine other MDBs’ influence.
“Of course, AIIB can and should be seen as a broader picture of China’s growing role in the world,” von Amsberg said. “China is complementing its bilateral investments, or direct loans, with a multilateral engagement, as most developed nations do.”
Von Amsberg said the bank is able to operate with a fraction of the World Bank’s staff by cooperating with consulting firms, academic institutions, government offices and other MDBs to develop its projects. AIIB’s billing sheet is about half the size of the World Bank’s, while its 120-member staff is less than one hundredth the size of the World Bank’s. Von Amsberg noted that the AIIB co-finances many World Bank projects and could not function without reciprocal assistance.
With the need for $93 trillion over the next 15 years for global infrastructure projects, von Amsberg said the AIIB is another part of the solution to solve the Infrastructure Investment Paradox — the phenomena where supply and demand for investment funds in the global market do not coincide.
AIIB is attempting to tackle the issue by committing to the creation of sustainable infrastructure projects that connect countries across international borders and to the mobilization of capital to meet the demand of emerging markets.
Von Amsberg said banks like his complement others, like the World Bank, in funding sustainable infrastructure projects.
“I’m not saying one model is better or worse. I’m saying we are consciously designing ourselves to complement the existing institutions rather than replicate them because we think that’s a more important way in which we can contribute,” von Amsberg said.

President Donald Trump’s incoherent policies on China and North Korea threaten international stability, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice argued in a webcast for the National Committee on United States-China Relations’ 2017 CHINA Town Hall.
Georgetown University’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs hosted the town hall as part of a nationwide dialogue at 85 different locations Wednesday night. The address was sponsored by the university’s Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues, which fosters research and dialogue on matters of transnational importance.
Rice answered questions from Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, as well as questions emailed and tweeted by the national audience.
Rice condemned Trump for escalating tensions and risking conflict with North Korea through aggressive rhetoric. Trump has tweeted multiple insults directed at North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, and threatened to “totally destroy” the country in his first United Nations address Sept. 21.
“The extremely heated rhetoric of President Trump, the threats that he was leveling — ‘fire and fury’ and the like, which were matching or exceeding the young Kim Jong Un’s rhetoric — was one, inappropriate, and two, dangerous. It risked precipitating miscalculation and inadvertent conflict,” Rice said.
At Georgetown’s event, Rice’s address was preceded by a conversation between Dennis Wilder, the Initiative’s managing director, and J. Bradford Jensen, professor and McCrane/Shaker Chair in International Business at the McDonough School of Business.
According to Rice, Trump’s criticisms of China’s permissive policy approach toward North Korea, threats to impose tariffs on Chinese exports and January phone conversation with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen during his transition into office have contributed to a lack of cooperation with China in addressing the North Korea threat.
“The U.S.-China relationship works best when there’s a high degree of communication and maximized mutual understanding at the highest levels,” Rice said. “I think that President Trump came in with some pretty hot rhetoric around China that left the Chinese side not clear about what our intentions were.”
“It is hard to find coherence in this strategy right now,” Wilder said.
Rice said that the United States should handle North Korea’s mounting nuclear capacity in the same way that it previously handled the nuclear-armed Soviet Union.
“We can manage this problem — if we must — through robust deterrence, in the same way we managed the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War,” Rice said.
Trump will travel to Asia on Nov. 3 and stay until Nov. 14. An Oct. 16 White House press release confirmed visits to South Korea and China as part of the official trip.
According to the press release, Trump will call upon the international community to “come together and maximize pressure” on North Korea in an address to the South Korean National Assembly scheduled for Nov. 7. He will meet with China’s president, Xi Jinping, the following day.
“The North Korean issue will dominate the president’s trip to East Asia, no question at all,” Wilder said.
Rice said that China’s rapid economic growth should not threaten U.S. interests if addressed appropriately. China is the second-largest economy in the world by GDP and was the world’s fastest-growing economy until 2015, when it was overtaken by India.
“We need to recognize that China is going to continue rising. Its economy, its population, its capacity ensure that it will be and remain a very powerful country for the foreseeable future,” Rice said. “I believe that with wise and thoughtful leadership on the United States’ part — steady leadership — that we can manage a world in which China grows and continues to prosper.”
Jensen, however, said China’s growth would eventually flatten as economic expansion is only sustained after countries first promote industrial production, female participation in the labor force, educational opportunities and physical infrastructure.
Both Rice and Jensen cautioned that the United States’ withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership will affect the political and economic dynamic with the countries in the Asian-Pacific region that are bound to the treaty, as well as China, which had expressed interest in joining. Trump formally withdrew the United States from the TPP, which had not been approved by Congress and never took effect, shortly after taking office in January.
“I think the power dynamic is shifting. It is not shifting in the United States’ favor,” Rice said. “The decision to cancel U.S. participation in TPP, I think, was an extremely big mistake.”
Jensen echoed Rice’s concerns.
“For people who watch trade, you know, we hope the next four years will be short and that the damage will be minimal, but it seems increasingly likely there will be damage,” Jensen said.
With China being an important world player in matters ranging from trade and climate change to cybersecurity, Rice said that she hoped the Trump administration would improve, instead of strain, relations with the country.
“I hope very much that the Trump administration is looking for areas where we can expand our cooperation, not just points of friction,” Rice said.

Washington, D.C., lost its bid to host the 2022 Gay Games to Hong Kong, despite Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) trip to Paris from Oct. 27 to Oct. 30 to lobby for the games.
Developed in 1982 as a way to bring recognition to the LGBTQ community and promote diversity in athletic competition, the Gay Games attracts thousands of competitors every four years. The 10th games will be held in Paris in 2018.
The District was among three finalist cities vying to host the 2022 games, with Hong Kong and Guadalajara, Mexico, holding the other two spots.
D.C. also lost its 2009 bid to host the 2014 Gay Games and its 2017 bid to host the 2024 Olympics.
Bowser and Brent Minor, D.C.’s Gay Games Bid Committee chair, were part of a 23-member committee that pitched their bid to the Federation of Gay Games.
Despite the loss of the bid, Bowser said she believes D.C.’s desire to host the games reflects the city’s values.
“Our bid proved that Washington, D.C. is strong not simply because we are diverse, but because we celebrate our diversity and inclusion,” Bowser wrote in an Oct. 30 news release. “As the world questions how the United States will position itself on the global stage, it is incumbent upon all of us to continue showing the world who we really are.”
Bowser was an active proponent for the bid since June, when she attended a rally in support of bringing the Gay Games to D.C. for 2022.
Minor said he looks forward to providing Hong Kong organizers with any help needed.
“While we are very disappointed that D.C. was not chosen as the host city for the 2022 Gay Games, we extend our congratulations to Hong Kong,” Minor wrote Oct. 30. “We are confident that they will be able to present a great Gay Games and we offer any assistance we can provide to make that happen.”
The Games would have brought between 12,000 to 15,000 competitors and 80,000 to 100,000 spectators, according to the D.C. Office of the City Administrator.
According to the D.C. Center for the LGBT Community, an LGBT advocacy organization, the games would have brought in between $120 and $140 million in revenue for the District.
The D.C. Government pledged $2 million in funding for the games, according to Minor. The government has not announced where the funds are now to be directed.
No Asian city has hosted the games since the event began in 1982.
Paul Choi, director of government relations for the Hong Kong 2022 bid team, told the South China Morning Post he hoped the games would be a “catalyst” for the government of Hong Kong to protect LGBT people.

Two Georgetown University students and one recent alumnus have been awarded the Marshall scholarship, a two-year, nonrestrictive, fully funded scholarship to study in the United Kingdom.
Rebecca Kuang (SFS ’18), Annee Lyons (COL ’18) and Ben Johnson (NHS ’17) plan to further their academic careers on completely different paths from one another — ancient Chinese history, classics and aerospace medicine, respectively.
Forty-three scholars were chosen nationwide as winners of the highly sought scholarship this year. Georgetown has produced six winners in the past two years.
John Glavin, the director of the Office of Fellowships, Awards and Resources said it takes years of planning to receive a Marshall scholarship.
“You can’t just decide the summer before your senior year that you’d like to win one of these, because you have to carefully think about your choices and how you’re doing things and be ready by the time you’re a senior,” Glavin said.
Johnson and Kuang credit much of their success to the Carroll Fellowship Initiative, a four-year intensive honors program with the aim of preparing students for a future in fellowship and success. Lyons did not participate in the program as an underclassman, but entered the program the summer before her senior year.
“We are trained to think in ways that would make us competitive for these things, and we’re encouraged to do something called the ‘CRIG,’ creativity, risk-taking, independence and grit,” Kuang said.
The recipients described the scholarship as a chance to foster an international community between the United States and the United Kingdom, citing it as one of the most important draws for them.
“Marshall Scholars are encouraged to be ambassadors for these two countries, and as someone who’s never been to the U.K., being a part of that legacy is really cool to me,” Kuang said.
 
Rebecca Kuang
Kuang plans to study the legacy of warfare in China at Cambridge University with the Marshall Scholarship.
“For the longest time, the [People’s Republic of China] suppressed the history of World War II because it makes them look really bad. What I’m looking at is how China remembers the trauma of World War II now,” Kuang said.
Kuang’s interest in the region developed after she studied abroad in Beijing the summer following her sophomore year. She said the experience inspired her to write a novel about modern Chinese history.
“I got super into researching the past, and our relationship to the past and how we deal with the ghost of memories,” Kuang said.
Kuang hopes to be a professor of modern Chinese history after obtaining a Master of Philosophy at Cambridge.
Her novel “The Poppy War” is slated to be published in May by HarperCollins Publishers.
 
Anne Lyons
Lyons, a classics major, plans to obtain a Master of Philosophy at the University of Oxford with the Marshall Scholarship. She said she appreciates the academic community at Oxford as it relates to her interests in history.
“There are people at Oxford who have opened up ancient history to more social history, looking at slaves, women, the illiterate, seeing that experience. So much of that history was thrown in the trash, it wasn’t valuable. Now, it’s starting to be revalued,” Lyons said.
After her time in the United Kingdom, Lyons hopes to ultimately become a classics professor where she can “get paid to talk about [classics] all the time.”

Ben Johnson
Johnson, a human science major, pursued his interests in both mental health and medicine at Georgetown through Georgetown Emergency Response Medical Service and Project Lighthouse, a campus mental health advocacy and support group. With the Marshall Scholarship, Johnson plans to obtain two master’s degrees: one in human cognitive neurophysiology at the University of Edinburgh and one in space physiology and health at King’s College of London.
As a first-year medical student at Johns Hopkins University, Johnson will take a leave of absence for two years. He plans to finish medical school after his time in the United Kingdom, but he said the opportunities he will gain from his time abroad outweigh any inconvenience.
“My experience internationally collaborating with space researchers with other countries and the U.K. and the European space agency will be invaluable with making those very strong bonds and continuing to capitalize on international partnerships and what that can bring us in terms of future space missions,” Johnson said.
Johnson said he hopes Georgetown students will pursue their interests no matter how trivial they may seem.
“When I started I never would’ve thought that mental health would have come along for the ride, but it’s become such a big part of my interests,” Johnson said.
[…] book deal is far from her only recent success. Kuang was one of only 43 U.S. recipients of this year’s Marshall Scholarship, an award that funds up to three years of graduate study at any university in the United […]

American values are not always so dissimilar from those in conservative Muslim countries, posits Gary Wasserman (SFS ’66), a former professor of government at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar, in his recent book reflecting on his experiences living and working in Doha.
Wasserman taught from 2006 to 2014, joining the SFS-Q faculty just one year after the institution opened its doors.
Since his return to the United States from Doha, Wasserman has dedicated his time to writing his book, “The Doha Experiment: Arab Kingdom, Catholic College, Jewish Teacher,” which was published Nov. 14 and discusses his eight years in the region.
Wasserman highlights his efforts to reach across boundaries and describes his experience administering a liberal education in a region of the world unfamiliar to many Americans. Through personal anecdotes, Wasserman discusses not only the lessons he sought to teach but also how his interactions with his students changed his own understanding of the world.
The Hoya sat down with Wasserman to learn more about his experience abroad.
You have previously mentioned the unusual nature of teaching as a Jewish professor at a Catholic school in a predominantly Muslim country, so what inspired you to go to Qatar? 
I had been working mostly in Washington as a political consultant, then I taught for a year in China, and I enjoyed the experience of teaching overseas. It was frankly easier to get a job overseas, and I also thought this would be an interesting, challenging opportunity. Now, unfortunately, when I told my family and friends about this, they all looked at me like I was crazy, you know?
This was a few years after 9/11, and a Jewish professor going to the Middle East to teach sounded to many of them like an act of lunacy, and I began to wonder about my own sanity. I talk in the book about how you have to start out with a kind of “You’re going to do what?” to getting to know real people on the ground and finding that the categories that we use for understanding people we don’t know very well tend to fall away.
Your book talks about the tension between Qatar’s traditional society and Georgetown’s mission of liberal education. Can you elaborate on that?
Georgetown was set up for foreign service, essentially to educate bureaucrats in becoming administrators, but Georgetown itself — the administrators and teachers — saw themselves as providing a liberal education.
Grounding in philosophy and economics and history and politics, which was more oriented to educating the whole person, they weren’t trying to train students into a certain profession. They were trying to educate young people in this tradition of liberal education. There was that disagreement and a kind of implicit misunderstanding, but I think the Qataris and the Qatari leaders were very welcoming of what Georgetown was doing, including courses like the “Problem of God” for instance, and respecting Georgetown’s scholars’ willingness to take on what they were doing. They gave Georgetown a lot of scope to do what they were going to do.
You also talked about how Qatar was very different from its other Middle Eastern counterparts in terms of its willingness to globalize and its acceptance of Western cultural attitudes. Do you think that these schools that are coming in are a positive force in this regard? 
Qatar and many of the nations are in flux. They’re very much sorting through what parts of their tradition they want to retain and what parts have to be adapted to the modern world. We’re not exactly the epitome of liberal societies now in the world. I think all countries adapt themselves in different ways to different pressures, different interests and different values. They are going through that adaptation, and I think they’re doing it with the resources they have. They have a lot of resources, a lot of money, and they have an enlightened leadership that I think understands that Qatar is going to prosper and survive in the world, and in the future they’re going to have to adapt to that globalized world.
Can you share one of those experiences that you thought was one of the more interesting ones you had there or that struck you? 
I had a student in one of my classes who was always kind of bringing up Israel or Zionism in an international relations class; it seemed to always go back to the question of the involvement of Zionists in a little bit of conspiratorial stuff he was thinking. And it came out frequently in class, and we talked about it in private, in quiet, and of course, he didn’t quite see it that way. I suggested he look more into the topic, but I didn’t think it was a very successful discussion that we had.
About a year or two later, he came back, and he had spent a semester at Georgetown’s main campus, and he had taken a class in Jewish civilization. He came back and he said, “You know, I never would have taken this class if I hadn’t been in your course.” It was one of those unexpected benefits. You have those kind of encounters that you don’t think are having an impact, but in fact, they do.
You mention you wanted this to be a positive, vital force in the region. Do you think we’re succeeding? 
I would say it’s incomplete. I think it’s succeeding in that it’s surviving and it’s adapting to the environment, and it’s succeeding in that it’s continuing to educate students. They’re continuing to graduate, and they’re continuing to think well of their experience at Georgetown and influencing the broader society.
I think it is succeeding. Whether it succeeds sufficiently and whether it is preserved remains to be seen, and part of it is how people kind of engage in what’s going on and spread some of the liberal ideas. Does press freedom expand in the society? Do women have more rights than they now have? There will be different markers, and I don’t think you go in there thinking your university is going to change the broader society or the broader region, but you do hope that over time, some of the ideas you’ve talked about have an impact.
What is something that you would like to see mentioned, or focused on more? 
I would like to see more interaction between the campuses. I’d like to see more people not interacting on the basis of religion, but just more connections between the main campus and Doha, between the very active Jewish civilization groups on the campus and more student activities between the campuses — a little bit of understanding of the students — because I think the students there have something to offer the main campus and vice versa, kind of getting away from these stereotypes, getting to know real people.
Is there anything you would like to add? Anything you think is important to you or to the book or to your experience in Doha?
What we’re doing in Doha is lowering walls. I think we came with the idea of being a modern missionary. We were going to deliver the truth in our campuses, and I think over time we’ve seen the importance of listening and trying to lower the walls a little bit between us and the rest of the region.

I did not know Gary very well when we were both undergraduates, except for the classes we shared and his role as the humor columnist for the East Campus student magazine.  I am very impressed with what he has done since we graduated, and especially with his work in Qatar, trying to “lower the walls” (in his phrase) between people of different cultures and political persuasions.

Collaboration between local leaders across the United States is crucial to addressing both local and national challenges, Mayors Francis Suarez (R) of Miami, Fla., Pete Buttigieg (D) of South Bend, Ind., and Lydia Mihalik (R) of Findlay, Ohio, said Tuesday night at an event cosponsored by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, the Georgetown Global Cities Initiative and the United States Conference of Mayors.
The event was moderated by Sheila Foster, a professor of law and public policy at the Georgetown University Law Center.
The event, which served as the GGCI’s first public offering, provided a forum for local officials to address their leadership in the face of the federal gridlock. Topics ranged from climate change resiliency and regionalism to the importance of cross-national governmental collaboration.
Suarez, who took office in November, said that local mayors can often be more effective than government at the state and federal levels dominated by party politics.
“We [mayors] look at the world as problem, solution,” Suarez said. “We don’t look at the world through a partisan lens.”
This pragmatic policymaking has allowed Miami to combat climate change by adopting resiliency efforts, Suarez added. To prevent flooding from rising seas, Miami officials promised last year to spend about $200 million on improved storm drainage systems, seawalls and flood pumps, according to the Miami Herald.
Buttigieg, who was elected in 2012 at the age of 29 as America’s youngest mayor of a city with about 100,000 people, offered regionalism as a solution to govern U.S. cities and towns.
“What we found is that we rise and fall as a region, and rather than try to all fight each other for our little parochial interests, what we really need to do is make sure that the region as a whole is better off,” Buttigieg said.
The South Bend mayor, who was a candidate for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship in February 2017, emphasized regionalism as a way for the United States to remain economically competitive against China.
“At a time when there are obscure, minor cities of 5 to 10 million in China, the idea that our big competition is from a nearby rural county just is no longer keeping up with the times,” Buttigieg said.
Mihalik, who became the first female mayor of Findlay upon her election in 2012, also emphasized the importance of collaboration. She promoted idea-sharing between local governments, touting the United States Conference of Mayors as a good example of collaboration.
“Mayors are really good at sharing passionately and stealing shamelessly,” Mihalik said, attributing her paraphrase to a common saying among mayors.
Tom Cochran, CEO and executive director of the USCM, said he was optimistic about the prospects for the United States under the mayors’ leadership.
“I’ve never had so much hope in America as I’ve had with this new crop of mayors that we have elected,” Cochran said. “I believe that if you are students of public service, look at the cities, look at the local level, and watch these mayors. You are looking at the future of America.”
Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), GU Politics executive director, is also optimistic about the future of politics, describing Suarez, Mihalik and Buttigieg as good examples for young people as they pursue leadership and public service roles in their communities.
“Too often in politics, I think that people are under the impression that they have to wait for their turn before they can be elevated to positions of leadership,” Elleithee said. “Well, here are three young people who seized an opportunity to make change in their local communities and are doing it every day, putting partisanship aside to just get things done.”
Kathryn Blanco (COL ’21) said the event inspired her to continue to explore the processes of local government.  
“I liked seeing how politics, or not even so much politics as governance, works on a local level, because it’s not something you hear about a lot on the news,” Blanco said. “It’s something I want to learn more about.”

Claudia Corral sent her application to Georgetown University on Oct. 25 from a small restaurant across the street from her home in Ocean Park, Puerto Rico. Her home had been without Wi-Fi since Hurricane Maria hit almost a month earlier.
Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico with 155 mph winds Sep. 20, following Hurricane Irma, which hit just two weeks earlier, on Sep. 6.
Georgetown typically receives about 40 early applications annually from Puerto Rico. This year, Georgetown received only 23 applications, according to Ismael Herrero, the interviews chair of the Georgetown University Alumni Club of Puerto Rico. Of those 23 applicants, eight students were accepted, including Corral.
Many applicants were offline and faced difficulties in applying, and power still has not been completely restored to the residents of Puerto Rico as of February 2018. The university worried about the effect of the hurricane on Puerto Rican applicants, according to Associate Member of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions Jaime Briseño.
“We knew that there were a number of students who, because of the hurricane, did not apply, and that’s consistent with a lot of our peer institutions. Everyone saw a drop in the number of candidates,” Briseño said.
The hurricanes flooded Corral’s neighborhood; she and her friends kayaked over their neighborhood’s streets and attended school in short stints because of the school’s low diesel fuel reserves. Following Irma, Corral did not have Wi-Fi at home for 86 days. She only hoped that everything she was sending was getting to Washington, D.C.
But Corral had been intent on applying to the Hilltop since she attended an information session in 2016. Exploring College Options — a special recruitment program sponsored by Duke University, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Stanford University and Georgetown — cohosts sessions like the one Corral attended every year in all 50 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
For students who cannot travel to the District to visit Georgetown themselves, the program has offered a more accessible resource to students who may not otherwise have applied.
But after the 2017 hurricanes’ devastating effects on communities in Puerto Rico, hosting another session became nearly impossible because of travelling and scheduling difficulties, prompting the consortium to drop the annual trip.
Two of the schools in the consortium, Georgetown and Harvard, did ultimately attend in early December 2017. For some applicants, it made a huge difference.
After the Storms, Stress
After attending her first information session for the Exploring College Options program in 2016, Corral knew Georgetown was the school for her.
“I’ve never gone to D.C. or seen Georgetown, but after that meeting I started doing research and I started looking into the classes and I was like, ‘Wow this is my school,’” Corral said in an interview with The Hoya. “People were like, ‘You’re crazy, how could you just choose this school?’ But I just knew it was for me.”
When it came time to apply, Hurricanes Irma and Maria had hit, leaving Corral’s home without power and, crucially for the application process, without Wi-Fi.
Corral and five other families in her neighborhood were the only ones who stayed behind when Hurricane Maria arrived. They kayaked to each other’s houses on the flooded roads and went to the restaurant across the street together where they had access to free — but unreliable — Wi-Fi.
The outages during Hurricane Maria gave Corral time to reflect on the supplemental questions asked on Georgetown’s application.
“It was just overall a really stressful situation, but it made for good writing. During Maria I had so much time to myself that I just wrote,” Corral said. “A lot of the questions that the application would ask like ‘What’s your sense of community?’ I never knew what to answer for those until Maria came. Because that’s when I really got to know who was in my community.”
Three weeks later, around the time when Corral was finally able to return to school, 84 percent of Puerto Rico remained without power and most of the island had little access to clean running water.
Although Corral was able to submit her early admission Georgetown application in October using the Wi-Fi in the restaurant across the street from her home, the mail in Puerto Rico had been running weeks behind, and she worried that she would not hear back in time about whether she got in.
Corral was not alone. Cristian Bernaschina, another early action Georgetown applicant from Puerto Rico, first visited Georgetown’s campus in eighth grade but did not seriously consider the school as a possibility until his junior year of high school. When he attended an information session for the first time in 2016, he started to picture a future for himself at Georgetown.
While Bernaschina had already sent in most of his application, he was still waiting on supplemental letters from his teachers.

Getting to San Juan
The destruction in San Juan from Hurricane Maria presented serious hurdles for the Exploring College Options universities. The group was unable to coordinate a joint information session in Puerto Rico for logistical reasons, leaving all plans for travel to San Juan and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, suspended.
Briseño, who reviews every application sent in by Puerto Rican students, as well as by students from Texas, the Caribbean and Latin America, was determined to make it to Puerto Rico despite the hurricane. He said he considers Puerto Rican students an important part of Georgetown’s campus.
“For us, we always had our message to the alumni community and the students that we didn’t want them to feel like ‘Well, that’s just too bad,’” Briseño said in an interview with The Hoya. “We were going to go back whether it was by ourselves or with one of our partners in the program.”
Harvard and Georgetown scheduled their own information session for early December, months after the originally scheduled Sept. 27 session, to give the island more time to recover from Hurricane Maria.
“We wanted to make every effort possible and let folks know that we are happy to consider extenuating circumstances, and we invite students to talk and discuss this,” Briseño said. “Often they include it in their essays, and the counselors and teachers would have included it in their letters of recommendation.”
Harvard admissions officer Abdiel Garcia wrote in an email to The Hoya that the university “found it important … to convey information about educational opportunities to students on the island, especially in times of social and economic challenge.”
“In that vein, shortly after Maria there were conversations about rescheduling the trip to the island at some foreseeable and appropriate time,” Garcia wrote. “We are grateful for our longstanding relationships with our peer institutions, Georgetown included, and we are thankful to all the folks who were involved in making this trip possible.”
Briseño emphasized that the other universities in the program are just as passionate and committed to Puerto Rican applicants as Georgetown and Harvard, and were only unable to attend because of insurmountable logistical challenges.
Georgetown’s decision to come to San Juan despite the hurricane made all the difference for students who applied to the university — apart from reaching applicants who may not have applied otherwise, during the hurricane, the info session provided a sense of normalcy, according to Corral.
“By the time the meeting was held, everything was a lot calmer. It was kind of nice; I don’t know, it felt normal, like something normal was finally happening, like we were having a college meeting, and we weren’t worried about anything else. I like that they came and visited,” said Corral.
Bernaschina believes that Georgetown’s decision to move forward with the information sessions will have a lasting impact on future applicants.
“I really feel that it helps, at least in Puerto Rico. Since a lot of people haven’t had the opportunity to visit Georgetown, the info sessions are very helpful,” Bernaschina said. “They really pass on the essence of the university.”
Georgetown also made efforts to ease the application process for students in affected areas by accepting students’ supplemental essays and letters of recommendation after the early action deadline of Nov. 1.
The university decided to send acceptance letters to students by email in lieu of the traditional mailed packets after several applicants called Georgetown’s admissions office with concerns about the island’s delayed mail service.
Corral got her email from Georgetown in December.
“I was kind of scared, and I wasn’t sure I was going to get in, but when I got in, that was amazing,” said Corral, who plans to start her first semester in the College in August 2018.
On Dec. 14, Bernaschina was also accepted: He received his acceptance email into the McDonough School of Business Class of 2022 on Dec. 14. He plans to attend in the fall.
“Every time I go to the Hilltop it’s like I fall in love more and more,” Bernaschina said. “I’ve been there a few times and I can really see myself there.”

The Georgetown University graduate student group, GU Chinese Students and Scholars Association, has received substantial funding from the Chinese government in years past, though the group has not broken any university funding rules, a recent report from Foreign Policy alleges.
The documentation of the funding points to Chinese government involvement with student groups on American college campuses, a link that is often suspected though difficult to prove, Foreign Policy reports. While not illegal, these relationships have been under scrutiny from U.S. security organizations, who have attempted for years to ascertain what, if any, threat the Chinese government and students pose to the United States.
The outlet wrote that it had obtained documents and emails from “a source concerned about Chinese Communist Party influence on university campuses” that showed the group had received about $1,600 in funding from the Chinese government, amounting to roughly half its annual budget in 2011.
Rachel Pugh, Georgetown’s senior director for strategic communications, said the university ensures all student groups adhere to university and government policies.
“As a global university, our international student body hails from more than 125 nations and contributes valuable experiences and perspectives that enhance the diversity and scholarship of our community,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We ensure that all student organizations comply with applicable financial rules and regulations.”
Founded in the early 2000s, Georgetown’s chapter of the national organization boasts a membership of about 230 students, most of whom are Chinese nationals and graduate students, according to the organization’s HoyaLink description. In addition to providing an on-campus space for Chinese graduate students adjusting to life at Georgetown, the CSSA helps connect the Chinese community on campus with other on-campus student groups to promote Chinese culture, according to group’s page.
A graduate student group, CSSA operates independently from undergraduate student organizations and receives much of its funding from the university and the Graduate Student Government through the Office of Graduate Enrichment Organizations. The Foreign Policy report states that the documentation of the funds comes from a September 2011 budget request received by Georgetown’s Graduate Student Government, which disclosed that the group received $800 each semester that school year from the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. The group requested an additional $750 each semester from the university on top of the money it received from the embassy, the request said.
While CSSA could not be reached for comment, members of the group said in their 2011 budget request that the Chinese funding was used to host events, such as the annual Chinese New Year party in 2011.
Georgetown has no rule against student groups receiving money from foreign governments, according to Kylie Navarro (COL ’20), chair of the Student Activities Commission, the funding and advisory board that allocates resources to university-recognized undergraduate groups.
“There is no university policy that prevents student groups from receiving money from any outside source, including foreign governments,” Navarro wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Outside funding sources are not considered when SAC makes a decision to allocate funding. Groups are not even required to report outside funding to SAC.”
Navarro said it is unlikely that SAC will be looking further into whether funding has come from foreign governments at the undergraduate level.
The CSSA also serves as a support network for Chinese students at nearly 150 other universities across the United States, including the University of Maryland, the University of California, San Diego and the University of Connecticut. The groups began to pop up more regularly in the 1980s, when Chinese students began to study abroad in the United States more regularly, The Washington Post reported in May 2017.
The groups often work with oversight from the Chinese government, advocating for pro-Chinese government agendas on campuses, according to The Washington Post.
The information newly reported by Foreign Policy follows a growing trend of tension between Chinese student groups and universities across the country. Students in the CSSA at other institutions have clashed with administrators at their universities over different decisions affecting Chinese culture.
The club protested a presentation on human rights violations in China at Columbia University a decade ago. At the University of Maryland, the CSSA responded to an address given by a Chinese student praising free speech in May 2017. The group responded by posting a video titled “Proud of China UMD,” composed of video segments responding to the student’s address.
“We are deeply concerned about some of the stereotypical comments in her speech, and we, Chinese students at UMD, decided to reply with the following videos,” the opening slide of the video read.

The CPC is not a friend to this country, to freedom or democracy. Their state news mocks our beliefs in these things. 
We would not have allowed the USSR to fund student groups or activities on our campuses. We should not allow the CCP to do so. This is a country that imprisons people for disparaging the government. Imagine being imprisoned for saying you don’t like Donald Trump or tweeting it. Or for saying he is an idiot.
You can’t imagine that. You don’t want to.

Your xenophobic racism is showing – what is there to be gained by stoking fears against Chinese students who, like you, just want to be here peacefully, learn, and celebrate the New Year?
This is like saying that the US supporting its nationals abroad through embassy and cultural services is also wrong.

But there has to be a story villifying Chinese so let’s bring in a whole bunch of unrelated anecdotes from other schools.

To counter the threat of digital encroachment on politics, government officials must be forward-thinking to anticipate challenges, said Matt Rhoades, the founder of Definers Public Affairs and the former campaign manager for Governor Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, at an event Friday afternoon.
Titled “Defending Digital Democracy: A Conversation on Protecting Campaigns with Robby Mook and Matt Rhoades,” the event featured a conversation between Rhoades and Senior Fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School and CNN Contributor Robby Mook, who managed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign. Mo Elleithee, the executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, moderated the event.
The conversation served as a platform for Rhoades and Mook to discuss their recently published “Cybersecurity Campaign Playbook,” a handbook that provides simple and achievable steps to keep a campaign secure, according to the introduction published on the Harvard Belfer Center’s website.
The discussion also focused on digital democracy as a bipartisan issue, a theme demonstrated by the inclusion of political operatives from different parties.
The event opened with a discussion of Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential campaign. Mook emphasized that, to prevent future interference, government officials need to anticipate areas that are susceptible to cyberattack.
“Russians were acting and seeking to either influence or disrupt the election,” Mook said. “The most important thing [is] to be forward-looking — what are we doing to prevent this from happening?”
Rhoades echoed Mook’s sentiment regarding the need to be forward-thinking, adding that he believes it is important to look beyond Russian interference when examining digital encroachment.
“It was all about being forward-looking; however, we need to focus on not just the Russians,” Rhoades said. “In the fall of 2011, I found out that one day our system had been breached by an outside entity in China. There are other states out there, and we are lucky to work at Harvard and the Belfer Center where people are really focused on today’s biggest cybersecurity threats, like Iran.”
The two experts also discussed their motives for publishing the “Cybersecurity Campaign Playbook,” which was published last fall. Rhoades said he was motivated by a need to disseminate practical, easy-to-understand information to communicate how to keep political campaigns free from interference.
“We wanted to do practical things, so first we put together a playbook for people who are working on campaigns all over the country,” Rhoades said. “The first thing about the playbook is that it needed to be practical, digestible and with a lot of free options. That was the theory and concept of why we put it together.”
Defending digital information is crucial, especially given the growing threat of people wanting to exploit digital information, Rhoades said.
“You wouldn’t believe how many leaders are out there who want their own personal accounts,” Rhoades said.
Mook advocated for government action to ensure cybersecurity, encouraging officials to look past just election interference.
“Sometimes our focus was too much on elections and administrators and not enough on legislators and Congress,” Mook said. “The system is set up that it’s not conducive to secure it, but that’s up to the legislators to put pressure on the legislators to get more security measures, to get Congress to put money and resources into the system.”

A coalition of Georgetown University student groups wrote an open letter to University President John J. DeGioia on behalf of Chinese students, requesting that the university publicly disavow FBI Director Christopher Wray’s recent remarks about the Communist Party of China’s potential use of college students and groups to further political goals.
Several students signed onto the Feb. 19 letter, including Georgetown University Student Association President Kamar Mack (COL’19); Gary Sipeng Xie (SFS ’19), GUSA Senator; and Yi Bao (SFS’19), political awareness committee co-chair and Asian American Student Association social co-chair.
Wray testified Feb. 13 to the Senate Intelligence Committee that student groups on American college campuses receiving funding from foreign governments may have ulterior motives.
“The use of non-traditional collectors, especially in the academic setting — whether it’s professors, scientists, students — we see in almost every field office that the FBI has around the country,” Wray said. “And I think the level of naivete on the part of the academic sector about this creates its own issues.”
During these remarks, Wray directly identified China as a threat to the United States.
“One of the things we’re trying to do is view the China threat as not just a whole of government threat but a whole of society threat on their end,” Wray said.
The letter to DeGioia accused Wray of attacking America’s Chinese population and fear-mongering against Chinese international students.
“What Wray created was in effect, a witch-hunt fueled by Dreyfus-style xenophobia and McCarthyist craze,” the letter read.
The letter noted the university’s appropriate responses to bias-related incidents on and off campus, as well as emails in response to movements in Ferguson, Mo., the Muslim ban that threatened to block entry into the United States for citizens of Muslim majority countries and the multiple swastikas that appeared in residence halls this year at Georgetown, but asked why the university had not yet made a public comment in response to Wray’s remarks.
“Will you merely refrain from injustice or will you accept responsibility and take care of your students. What is your response?” the letter read.
The remarks come after a report that the GU Chinese Students and Scholars Association had received funding from the Chinese government in 2011, Foreign Policy reported on Feb. 14. The funds are neither illegal nor in violation of any Georgetown University policy but have still come under scrutiny from U.S. security organizations.
The CSSA is a national organization, with chapters at universities across the country, some of which have received funding from the Chinese government, according to Foreign Policy. The CSSA, however, has said in previous budget requests that the funds were used to host events, such as Chinese New Year celebrations for students on campus.
The letter alleges that this increased scrutiny is based in bias and prejudice rather than reason.
“When a society cries out national security as an excuse for unorthodox responses, we often see civil rights violations,” the letter read. “When you judge someone categorically based on their race or country of origin, liberty and reason wither in pain.”

The global community must engage the voices of more women to promote peace and prosperity around the world, Alaa Murabit, a United Nations high-level commissioner on health employment and economic growth, said at a March 15 event.
“Less than 10 percent of peace processes last five years,” Murabit said. “But when women are included, they are 35 times more likely to last 15 years, that means an exponential opportunity for economic growth, political empowerment and regional stability — completely transforming the dynamic of the region.”
The event was cohosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and the Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, and cosponsored by the Georgetown University Women’s Center, the International Relations Club and the Muslim Students Association.
Originally from Saskatoon, Canada, Murabit moved to Zawia, Libya at the age of 15 to enroll in medical school. According to Murabit, the relegation of women to inferior roles after the Libyan revolution galvanized her to fight for women’s rights. In 2011, she formed The Voice of Libyan Women, an organization that focuses on women’s inclusion in peace processes and conflict resolution.
Murabit views women’s rights, particularly in the political sphere, as necessary for the continued advancement of society.
“I did not grow up as a women’s rights activist,” Murabit said. “I started identifying as a feminist after I began doing the work and saw that women’s inclusion was the only thing that would actually work in keeping our planet, our prosperity and our people alive to a significant degree.”
Through her work with The Voice of Libyan Women, Murabit said she recognized the positive effect that women can have on working on peace missions. At the March 15 event, she said women’s rights must be included in the state-building process to create a genuinely gender-equal society.
“If you don’t solidify women’s rights when you’re building the state, it’s not going to come in later, it’d be like trying to build a subway in an established city,” Murabit said. “So the idea for VLW was to ensure women’s inclusion was part and parcel of the nation-building and state-building process.”
VLW has since led a number of successful campaigns that have been replicated globally, which prompted Murabit to begin her current work on international security with the United Nations. According to Murabit, the answer to global population growth, an issue that Murabit views as one of the world’s greatest challenges, can be solved with women’s empowerment.
“The most cost-effective and practical solution to end climate change is population control, which is two things: women’s reproductive rights and girls’ education,” Murabit said.
Murabit also said that promoting global women’s education spurs economic growth.
“If we were to educate and employ girls and women equally, we would have greater economic growth than China and India combined,” Murabit said. “It’s the single greatest economic stimulus that exists in the world today.”
For Murabit, the way that a nation treats women can be an indicator of whether a country will thrive or fail.
“Empirically, the number one way that we can tell if a country is going to fall into conflict internally or regionally is a decline in the status and treatment of women,” Murabit said.
Murabit said politics will improve with engagement from more empowered women.
“I told my mom that I wanted to go to the moon, and she said, ‘Great, I’ll pack you a lunch.’ I was never told I couldn’t do anything, and gender was never brought up in my childhood,” Murabit said. “So when I saw the global policy data, I didn’t need to be convinced — it made the case for women’s rights for me.”

When representatives from the International Relations Club faced the Student Activities Commission on Monday, March 19, to explain why IRC members had travelled to Panama City earlier that month without required SAC approval, the club had already argued its case a week earlier to the commission, which included four current IRC members.
At the time of the March 19 SAC meeting, two commissioners — both current IRC members — had already pushed for a lesser sanction on the club’s international travel during a March 12 meeting, while two other IRC members had actively participated in SAC’s discussion over possible sanctions on the club. The SAC deliberations appeared routine, even as four IRC members discussed and voted on sanctions for an organization to which they belong. Two also held ranking positions in the Georgetown International Relations Association, a nonprofit that provides IRC with significant external funding.
Indeed, a review of meeting minutes from the 2017-18 academic year and interviews with current and former SAC commissioners point to apparent conflicts of interest between IRC and SAC, and a larger problem for a student commission charged with keeping clubs and other students accountable. Current and former commissioners, both IRC members and not, have expressed confusion over when they should participate in discussions and when club affiliations might present a conflict of interests.
Watching the Watchdog
Composed of 13 undergraduate students chosen through an application and interview process, SAC monitors and regulates over 110 student organizations at Georgetown University.
SAC — the advisory board that oversees funding allocation, approval of events and new club development — requires all student groups, from large groups like the IRC and Georgetown University College Democrats to smaller clubs like Mock Trial and Guerilla Improv, to submit event authorization forms, which include details like the number of participants, estimated costs and risks such as travel, overnight stay, presence of alcohol or presence of minors, before hosting programming of any kind.
From political clubs and cultural organizations, to comedy troupes and debating societies, SAC oversees them all, allocating about $350,000 in funding assigned to it from the student-run Georgetown University Student Association’s Finance and Appropriations Committee.
SAC’s 13 commissioners are each assigned to a handful of student organizations and act as informational liaisons between club leadership and the commission.
SAC Chair Kylie Navarro (COL ’20) said commissioners are selected to be accountable to and representative of the student body.
“One of the big questions that has been coming up with SAC commissioners — but also advisory boards in general — is how you remain accountable to the student organizations, to the student body in general,” Navarro said in an interview with The Hoya.
Navarro said commissioners serve a dual purpose: to inform student clubs of SAC guidelines and procedures and advocate for those clubs in committee meetings.
“One person does not have any sort of power over the funding that a certain group receives,” Navarro said.
This SAC structure is in place to minimize the potential influence of one person over the commission’s work, though Navarro acknowledged the ethical dilemma that can arise when commissioners hold external memberships to other student groups.
“We are very conscious of — in meetings — if a person is on a leadership board for a club, how they can remain unbiased when we’re talking about funding for a group and they’re voting,” Navarro said. “SAC asks commissioners who have a conflict of interest to recuse themselves from the vote, for whatever we’re going to be discussing.”
Though Navarro said board members of SAC groups must recuse themselves, the SAC bylaws require commissioners who serve on leadership boards of a club to recuse themselves from discussing or deliberating on matters that pertain to that club; “regardless of board affiliation, no Commissioner shall vote on any motions that involve organizations that they are members of,” Article 1 of the SAC bylaws reads.
Moreover, Article 1 of the SAC bylaws states conflicts of interest are impeachable offenses and defines a conflict of interest “as any arrangement whereby a member of SAC could, based on their affiliation with SAC, provide an unfair advantage to the commission itself, or any other organization or individual.”
Navarro said SAC leadership asks commissioners who have a conflict of interest to recuse themselves from voting and discussing club matters.
But former SAC Chair Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19) said despite these explicit rules, some former and current SAC commissioners have flouted these guidelines, pointing to the text of SAC bylaws that had not been previously enforced with consistency.
“SAC currently has provisions that prevent biased decision-making. That being said, I do not believe these measures provide sufficient protection, and even existing measures have not been fully implemented in past years,” Mondolfi said in an interview with The Hoya.
Navarro said she has made accountability and ethical procedures priorities under her term.
Ali Stowe, the assistant director of student engagement, reaffirmed this expectation of ethical procedures.
“Commissioners with ties to an organization are asked to abstain from debate, since once the deliberation period has started, organizations are not allowed to comment, so a Commissioner cannot provide any supplemental info,” Stowe wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Additionally, Commissioners abstain from voting during event approval and allocation votes for organizations in which they serve in a leadership capacity.”
Mondolfi said he made efforts to address bias in his term.
“We recognized this kind of behavior as improper, and while it was always discouraged, we took measures to stop this kind of behavior when we modified our Constitution and bylaws in the fall of 2017,” Mondolfi said.
Minute by Minute
Despite these tenuous institutional safeguards, some members of SAC have routinely skirted these guidelines.
For example, some SAC commissioners who are members of IRC, a student organization of over 500 members with a complex leadership structure, also serve in leadership positions for the Georgetown International Relations Association, an educational nonprofit that organizes Model United Nations conferences for high school and college students. These commissioners frequently comment on IRC matters.
Though IRC and GIRA share a large number of members, the two are distinct entities, according to IRC Chair Jaylan Smith (SFS ’20).
“Many GIRC members participate in conferences that GIRA hosts and GIRA does provide a semester-by-semester bulk allocation to support International Relations education with our events,” Smith wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s not rare for a board member of one to be a part of the membership of the other.”
However, the IRC website and its HoyaLink website refer to GIRA as its “sister organization,” and its members and leaders often overlap. GIRA also provides significant annual funding to the IRC.
This overlapping IRC and GIRA membership includes at least seven current and former SAC commissioners from the past two semesters, including current commissioners Chase Wagers (COL ’20), Elodie Currier (SFS ’19), Maddie Mousseau (COL’21) and Patrick Walsh (SFS ’21); current non-voting commissioner Abhinav Saravanan (SFS ’21) and former commissioners Carley Mambuca (SFS ’19) and Aaron Baum (SFS ’20).
Wagers currently serves as the secretary-general of the GIRA-organized North American International Model United Nations conference and was previously head of NAIMUN in China. He is also a dues-paying member of the IRC.
Currier serves as GIRA’s chief global strategist and will serve as GIRA CEO next year. She is a travel-team member of IRC.
Saravanan has served as a GIRA conference staffer and is a member of IRC; Mousseau has served as a GIRA conference staffer and is a member of IRC; Walsh has served as a GIRA conference staffer and is a member of IRC; Mambuca served as executive director of NAIMUN last year and is an IRC member; Baum currently serves as IRC’s communications director and is a GIRA member.
According to publicly available meeting minutes, these commissioners have weighed in on at least 19 separate cases relevant to the IRC and have selectively chosen to recuse themselves from votes and discussion on IRC matters.
When SAC discussed disciplinary action following the IRC’s Panama trip, Mousseau, Wagers and Walsh all participated in the March 12 conversation. They all voted to bring IRC back the following week and re-evaluate a potential ban on IRC travel. On March 19, the three commissioners also participated actively and debated on how IRC would be sanctioned.
Despite at least two previous cases in February and March 2017 in which IRC similarly failed to submit EAFs for Model United Nations trips to West Point and the University of California at Berkeley — for which Baum and Mambuca led discussion and voted — SAC ultimately voted in March 2018 not to impose a travel ban on IRC, opting instead for a financial penalty. Mousseau, Wagers and Walsh all participated and voted in this discussion. Currier abstained.
This financial penalty, a limit on the level of funding IRC can receive from SAC for its travel events, will be in place for fall 2018 and spring 2019, Navarro said.
In September 2017, IRC sought funding and approval for the Columbia University Model United Nations, Boston University MUN, University of Pennsylvania MUN and Yale University MUN conferences. Mambuca and Baum moved for approval and allocation of funds on all of these trips, amounting to a total $7,402 in funding.
Baum said this behavior was assumed to be standard.
“The Standard Operating Procedure during my time on SAC was simply that Board members abstained from voting on important matters related to the organizations that they lead; that is what the then-SAC Chair Ricardo Mondolfi told the Commissioners to do,” Baum wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Commissioners frequently voted on and discussed motions on the clubs in which they were active, and indeed the commission often thought it helpful to turn to Board members of the clubs they were discussing to better understand a request.”
Renewed Transparency
The seven current and former IRC commissioners maintain they behaved ethically and professionally in all their SAC dealings and said they did not believe they violated bylaws.
Mambuca said that, in practice, members of clubs are allowed to participate in discussions for groups they belong to.
“I was always careful to abstain from voting when discussing matters of the IRC,” Mambuca wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Currier said she was sure to always abstain on votes that pertained to IRC, though she contests that the bylaws require general members of clubs to recuse themselves from participating in discussion.
“Referencing the specific bylaws which refers to conflict of interest, which requires that only commissioners who are members of the BOARD of the group they are part of remain silent or leave the room on discussions on their groups,” Currier wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I acknowledge that the bylaw is confusingly worded, but I was at the drafting and interpreted as I felt that the original writers had, which was that IRC board members had to be silent during discussions, and excuse themselves from votes.”
Current commissioner Connor Sakati (COL ’18) said IRC’s case is particularly complicated because of the relationship between GIRA and IRC.
“The problem with IRC is that it’s a multi-tiered system, and there’s so much to it,” Sakati said in an interview with The Hoya. “Most members of SAC, and even most members of IRC I think, don’t necessarily understand what [GIRA] really entails or how much money they get from it.”
While current commissioners claim they do not hold board positions in IRC, they can simultaneously be IRC members and leaders in GIRA.
But Mondolfi said regardless of whether commissioners are board members, their participation can appear to provide unfair advantages to overrepresented groups.
“They are often active participants in discussions about requests from their groups. This gives them the opportunity to add details, explanations and excuses to the discussion as well as communicate with the people making the request, which is safe to call an unfair advantage,” Mondolfi said. “Groups get one commissioner to represent them before SAC, but sometimes it feels like certain groups have three or four.”
Navarro said leadership is aware of potential bias and is working to prevent these instances from occurring.
“We also screen against bias in our recruitment of new commissioners, as we consistently ask applicants how will they work to remain unbiased on the commission,” Navarro said.
Mondolfi contends that SAC is not meant to be a representative body and that unbiased decisions should be the priority of commissioners and the recruitment process.
“During my tenure as chair, we often discussed how we could ensure that the system was as fair as possible in order to better serve all students,” Mondolfi said. “Perhaps the most important area of improvement is hiring: If more students were willing to serve on SAC, we certainly would not have this issue. Students, especially first-years and sophomores, should strongly consider applying.”

Maybe I’m overly optimistic, but I feel like commissioners should refrain from speaking on organizations with whom they participate on ethical principal. Following the by-laws is a below-the-floor minimum for being a responsible commissioner. 
I checked the budget summit document to see what the overlap is between purportedly GIRA events and IRC funding requests. Interestingly, SAC has not given the IRC a budget tier.

A record 30 Georgetown University students, including 19 graduating seniors, are set to receive Fulbright scholarships to pursue individual research and English language teaching fellowships around the world this year.
The total number of grant recipients this year tops last year’s 27 and is set to place Georgetown in the top five U.S. institutions to produce Fulbright scholars this year. Fulbright scholars receive federal funding in the form of grants to study abroad after graduation, conduct individual research, pursue master’s degrees or teach English in foreign countries.
Every year, around 100 Georgetown students participate in the yearlong application process. Competition varies on the country selected for foreign study, and the fellowship is not limited to students with certain GPAs, according to Lauren Tuckley, senior associate director of the Office of Fellowships, Awards and Resources.
Created in 1946 by President Harry Truman and Senator J. William Fulbright after World War II, the Fulbright Program is the U.S. government’s flagship international education exchange program, according to the Fulbright website.
The Fulbright U.S. Student Program, which oversees exchange programs for students and young professionals, currently awards 1,900 grants in all areas of study and operates programs in more than 140 countries. Fulbright scholars can either conduct research, pursue a master’s degree or teach abroad.
The Georgetown Office of Fellowships, Awards, and Resources oversees Georgetown’s Fulbright application process, connecting second-semester juniors and seniors to faculty volunteers and advisers throughout the yearlong process.
Tuckley said Georgetown consistently performs well in securing Fulbright fellowships.
“The Fulbright is our signature program here in the Office of Fellowships because there is an enormous interest and it’s a really good fit for the typical Georgetown student,” Tuckley said in an interview with The Hoya. “We estimate we will be in the top five [of Fulbright-producing institutions], but we will be in the next few years, number one. That is the goal.”
Tuckley said the Fulbright program’s lack of a minimum GPA requirement is meant to encourage well-rounded applicants with genuine passion for research or teaching in the countries they choose.
“This is not something that’s just looking to find your 4.0s; this is looking for someone with a genuine cultural interest to identify an academic goal either through teaching or through research or through study and to say, ‘This would be a meaningful experience to me and I want to go abroad and make the most of it,’” Tuckley said. “That is the winning formula. Anybody that has an interest in going abroad — bring me anybody; I can find them Fulbright.”
Tuckley and Laura Perille, GOFAR’s associate director, provide students information, advising and connections to faculty advisers beginning in January. They continue to provide interest sessions, study breaks and newsletter updates throughout the spring and summer until the Sept. 1 Georgetown deadline for students to submit their application materials, including personal statements and grant requests.
“One of the substantive things that the office can do for students on an individual advising basis is to help them to identify the goal of what they want to do with their Fulbright year and then help them understand the very nature of the competition so that they can have their academic goals and their cultural exchange goals met, and at the same time identify the most likely competition for that individual to compete in,” Tuckley said.
Haley Florsheim (SFS ’18) won a Fulbright teaching fellowship to teach English in Brazil after completing a Latin American studies certificate and international politics major, for which Florsheim researched and wrote a thesis on legislative progress on preventing violence against women and securing reproductive rights in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.
“You know, speaking of academic experiences here at Georgetown — that was by far the most rewarding academic experience that I have had, and it was just absolutely fantastic,” Florsheim said in an interview with The Hoya. “I was lucky enough to work with some really great professors, which made a huge difference, and I think that I owe a lot of that experience to their support and guidance and just their enthusiasm for the program and my personal project.”
Florsheim said her personal background motivated her to attain proficiency in Spanish and Portuguese, leading her to choose Brazil as her focus country.
“As a 6-year-old I had Spanish in my public school, which doesn’t exist anymore due to budget cuts, unfortunately. But that literally shaped my interests in the way that I saw myself in the world just because from an early age, you know, growing up in Wisconsin, you feel sort of far from other countries,” Florsheim said. “When I got to Georgetown, those sort of experiences I guess collectively culminated in my decision to attend Georgetown and to study international politics.”
Sarah Mack (SFS ’18), who won a fellowship to conduct research in Yanji, China, on how Koreans in China express their identity through language, said her personal background played a role in her Fulbright application process as well.
“Before I came to Georgetown I was a high school exchange student in South Korea, and while I was there I became really interested in North Korea,” Mack said in an interview with The Hoya. “I came across professor Victor Cha’s book ‘The Impossible State.’ He became my hero and I was obsessed with and I had to take his class.”
But Mack noted the stronger role her extracurricular involvement played in cementing her academic interests.
“Surprisingly, the big thing that had the biggest impact on my career was actually not that class or that professor or any professor really, but a small group that we have at Georgetown called Georgetown THiNK, or Truth and Human Rights in North Korea,” Mack said. “I’ve been the president of that club for two years, and, like, most of the connections that I have, I met through a club with, like, a really small budget.”
Tuckley said this intersection of personal and academic interests makes the best Fulbright scholars.
“The mission is so important to the scholarship and the award in that it was designed in 1946 after the Second World War with the idea that we would be a better nation if we had individuals with a greater degree of interaction with otherness, with people from other cultures, so that in some ways we become more informed and tolerant individuals,” Tuckley said. “To bring that sensibility back to the United States is what this program is about.”
Mack said she hopes current students are encouraged to apply, regardless of how their Georgetown experiences have gone.
“If at first you don’t succeed, apply, apply again. Just keep applying until you get something. I had a really hard time at Georgetown, especially my first year; I felt like I wasn’t supposed to be here, I felt like kind of stuck and like I was a loser, but I also found my place. I know a lot of freshmen might be in that place right now,” Mack said. “It’s about believing yourself.”

Climate change and instability in the Middle East pose the greatest threats to the world security for the next generation, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said at the commencement ceremony for Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service on May 19 in McDonough Arena.
Guterres, who previously served as the United Nations high commissioner for refugees from 2005 to 2015 and as the prime minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002, addressed the SFS Class of 2018 on Saturday, telling the graduates that the global community had not yet taken sufficient action to combat climate change.
“We need to rush in order to make sure that we change the pattern of the global economy in order to be able to contain climate change, but we are not yet doing enough,” Guterres said.
Guterres acknowledged the significance of the 2015 Paris Agreement, an international accord to reduce climate change signed by 195 countries in 2016, but insisted that urgent action remained necessary if the agreement were to have the intended impact.
“We need not only to commit to respect the Paris Agreement, but we need to do it with an enhanced ambition,” Guterres said. “We need to do more [and to do it] faster, if we want to preserve our planet and to avoid the horrible consequences of what would be a higher increase in the global temperatures.”
The Paris climate accord, which is set to go into effect in 2020, aims to keep the increase in the global temperature well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to limit the increase to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to lessen the impacts of climate change.
President Donald Trump announced in June 2017 his plan to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, because he said it would harm the U.S. economy. Despite Trump’s announcement, U.S. withdrawal will not be possible until November 4, 2020, as stipulated by the agreement.
Guterres warned of the consequences stemming from climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of natural disasters, rising sea levels and growing acidity of the oceans among others. However, Guterres said there are reasons to be optimistic about progress being made in combatting climate change.
“Technology is on our side,” Guterres said. “We see that there are more and more jobs being created in renewable energies, both in the United States and China, more than the jobs created by the oil and gas industry.”
Investing in renewable resources is not just a necessity, but it would also be beneficial in moving forward technology globally.
“The stone age did not end for lack of stones. There were plenty of rocks in the world at that time,” Guterres said. “The stone age ended because new technologies would be able to provide better societies. Let’s not wait for fossil fuels to end to end the fossil fuel age. Let’s make sure we all join our efforts to create a world with a green economy and a sustainable future.”
Shifting gears to international affairs, Guterres also pointed to conflicts in the Middle East as a growing threat to global security.
“We see that in the last decade, we have a multiplication of conflicts, and at the same time the old conflicts seem never to die, be it in Somalia, in Afghanistan or the Democratic Republic of the Congo,” Guterres said.
However, these conflicts have also taken on new elements not previously seen in other global conflicts, according to Guterres.
“What is to a certain extent new is that these conflicts are becoming more and more interlinked with each other, with fighters going from one place to another, and more and more linked to what it is now a global threat of terrorism that, of course, creates insecurity and creates anxiety everywhere in today’s world,” Guterres said.
To conclude his speech, Guterres called upon the graduating seniors to take on the failures of his generation.
“Where my generation has largely failed, I strongly encourage to make sure that your generation delivers, that your generation creates the conditions to allow, with a strong commitment to service and using as much as possible all the talents that you have received in this school and multiplying them and distributing them, to make sure … that our future will allow my three granddaughters to live in a healthy world, without conflict and without suffering, and in a healthy planet that is green and sustainable,” Guterres said.

Great to see SFS attract such a high level speaker at commencement.  Certainly, better than when I graduated in 65.  But he did not speak about the diminishing role of the UN to solve some of these problems, especially in the Middle East. I hope the new generation of SFS graduates achieves goals that are higher than mine. But I did spent a successful career reducing poverty around the world through promoting and creating cooperatives.

To address China’s growing soft power influence on student groups at colleges around the country, universities must understand the context of the situation fully before taking action, said Robert Sutter, the director of the B.A. in International Affairs at The George Washington University, at an event Tuesday hosted by the Alexander Hamilton Society.
In addition to Sutter, the event featured Toshi Yashihara, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and former teacher of strategy at the Naval War College, and Dan Blumenthal, the director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute and former senior director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia at the Department of Defense.
The event took place less than a year after reports surfaced in February that the Georgetown University Chinese Students and Scholars Association received funds from the Chinese government. Nearly half of the Georgetown CSSA budget came from the Chinese government.
The increasing influence of Chinese soft power on student groups is emerging now, and there is still insufficient evidence to determine the best response to China’s influence on students, Sutter said. He recommended Americans wait for the problem to become more understandable before deciding on a course of action.
“In this kind of an issue, we don’t have enough evidence, we don’t have enough data to make a guess it seems to me … And so it’s a relevant issue — it’s just a new issue this year in Washington, and I think we have to get more data,” Sutter said. “And maybe after that we can come up with some reasonable judgment. If we rush to judgment and say it’s this and that … I think is excessive.”
The ambiguity of Chinese influence operations makes it difficult to discern which pose a legitimate threat, according to Yoshihara.
“One of the subtleties of influence operations is that it operates in that twilight zone where it’s very difficult to figure out,” Yoshihara said.
Many of the Chinese influence operations subtly encourage limitations on free speech, Yoshihara added.
“Influence operations operate in that blurry twilight zone and I think one of the things I worry about most is its ability to very subtly shape the bait,” Yoshihara said. “Whether it’s the Confucius Institutes or the student associations on campuses, it’s that it creates an atmosphere that for example very subtly enforces self-censorship.”
Yoshihara — referencing the Chinese United Front, a coalition of political parties in China led by the Communist Party — said the coalition’s ideological roots cultivate a worldview based on fear of and animosity toward the West.
“This is deeply ideological. I would describe the worldview as one categorized by fear, loathing and paranoia … It’s not just what the West does, it’s actually who the West is, what the West is, what it represents,” Yoshihara said. “And so the United Front sees the West as seeking to export ideas, cultures … and this is seen as an existential threat to the regime.”
The Chinese United Front works to spread propaganda that prevents the Chinese population from defecting to support Western culture, according to Yoshihara.
“They tend to sort of overestimate in some ways the power or the influence of the West. Since China engaged in reform and opening in the late 1970s, obviously, a flood of Western values and influence flooded in,” Yoshihara said. “And so the writings are taken … to inoculate the population from these ideological pollutants or contaminants.”
Blumenthal highlighted that the definition of soft power in China has evolved through the years.
“Soft power, which when it was first written … it said something very specific … it was a cultural and intellectual input, traction, in a country,” Blumenthal said. “Now I guess it’s taken on a meaning in China.”
Sutter, a former professor in the School of Foreign Service, President Donald Trump’s policies on China mark a significant shift away from traditional strategies.
“The United States is in the middle of the most important re-evaluation of China policy in my fifty years here in Washington. I haven’t seen anything like this, what we’re doing here … on a whole range of issues: security,” Sutter said.

An entertainment and sports arena set to house Washington, D.C. professional women’s basketball team the Washington Mystics, as well as NBA G-League team Capital City Go-Go, opened Sept. 22 in Congress Heights and is anticipated to bring jobs and increased economic opportunities to residents of the neighborhood.
The opening of the $65 million arena offers the District more than just a new sports facility, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said in a Sept. 22 news release.
“The Entertainment and Sports Arena is the home our Mystics deserve. But this project is even bigger than basketball,” Bowser said. “The ESA is about jobs, opportunity, and community; it’s about ensuring that every neighborhood, in every corner of our city has world-class housing and amenities.”
The ESA also serves as the official practice facility for D.C. professional men’s basketball team, the Washington Wizards. The Wizards will continue playing their home games at the Capital One Arena, located in Chinatown.
The construction of the new arena is a rare development effort in the Congress Heights neighborhood, which often gets passed over, according to The Washington Post.
The venue was built on the former site of the St. Elizabeth’s East Hospital as a District-led effort to revitalize the neighborhood. The arena is anticipated to create almost 3,000 jobs for community members, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Brian Kenner told The Washington Post.
The Bowser administration announced its plans to construct the ESA in 2015 as part of an initiative to increase economic prosperity in the surrounding neighborhood. The initiative is in partnership with the District’s convention and sports authority, Events D.C., and sports company Monumental Sports & Entertainment.
Monumental Sports & Entertainment, owner and operator of the Washington Capitals, Wizards, Mystics and Capital One Arena, has pledged to invest $10 million in Congress Heights over the next 19 years of its contract on the property, according to NBC.
Bowser was joined at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the arena by Kenner, Ward 8 councilmember Trayon White, officials from Events D.C. and representatives from Monumental Sports & Entertainment, according to the Sept. 22 news release.
Although the District owns the arena, officials from Events D.C. will manage the day-to-day programming of the ESA, according to Washingtonian.
The 4,200-seat arena will feature cultural and community events for citizens in addition to economic opportunity, said President and Chief Executive Officer of Events D.C. Gregory A. O’Dell in a Sept. 22 news release.
“Similar to some of our other venues like the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and Nationals Park, this arena is important not only for the attraction of new events and experiences to the city, but for DC’s greater economic development and job creation,” O’Dell said.
The ESA will host a variety of entertainment events ranging from sports games to musical performances, O’Dell said in a Sept. 22 news release.
“We look forward to delivering unmatched event programming from esports and boxing to amateur sports and electrifying concerts – starting with our grand opening celebration blockbuster lineup,” O’Dell said.
The venue will host its grand opening concert featuring R&B artist Mary J. Blige and singer-songwriter Jacob Banks on Saturday, Oct. 6. Popular American bands Cage the Elephant and Judah & the Lion are set to perform at the arena’s second grand opening ceremony the following week on Oct. 13.
Other future events will include the semifinals of a mixed martial arts Professional Fighters League in October, as well as the Colonial Athletic Association’s men’s basketball tournament games from 2020 through 2022.
The ESA and other development efforts are expected to bring Congress Heights economic prosperity similar to that of other D.C. neighborhoods, Ward 8 Advisory Neighborhood Commission Chairperson Mary Cuthbert told The Washington Post.
“Development has been very slow and very rare, and that’s why we’re so excited about it,” Cuthbert said. “It’s going to change the whole neighborhood completely. Just as all the other neighborhoods in Washington, D.C., have changed, this too will change.”

Democratic countries around the world must collaborate to contribute to protecting a liberal world order, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono (SFS ’86) said at an event Sept. 28 in Gaston Hall.
Before becoming foreign minister, Kono served in the Japanese House of Representatives, where he was a member of five standing committees, including those on economy, health, labor and welfare, trade and industry, the environment, and finance. He also held several leadership positions in the House, serving as Parliamentary Secretary for Public Management, Director of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Assistant Secretary General of the Liberal Democratic Party and Deputy Secretary General of the LDP.
In 2015, he joined Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet as the Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission. Abe appointed Kono to his current position as foreign minister in August 2017.
The event was the second in the Lloyd George Centennial Lectures program, which began last February to celebrate the upcoming centennial anniversary of the School of Foreign Service in 2019. After delivering his lecture, Kono discussed international affairs in the Indo-Pacific region with Michael Green, Director of the Georgetown University Asian Studies Program, and students in the Master of Arts in Asian Studies program.
Japan, in cooperation with the United States, needs to step up to defend a liberal international system that prioritizes democratic values, such as human rights and representative government, Kono said.
“The United States has shouldered the burden of this liberal international order in quite a big way. I think it’s time for us to adjust the burden sharing,” Kono said. “And that’s what President Trump is asking, and I think we are ready to do that.”
Kono also called on other democratic countries in Europe, as well as Australia and New Zealand, to assume responsibility for advocating for global democracy.
“Since the end of the World War II, we’ve benefited from this liberal international order,” Kono said. “I think Japan, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and other countries need to shoulder a little bit more so that the U.S. burden will be less.”
The international political order based on democratic values now faces challenges that threaten global prosperity, Kono said, referring to unilateral attempts around the world that pose a risk to the current political atmosphere.
“What has underpinned the stability and the prosperity of the world is the international order based on fundamental values such as democracy, freedom, human rights, rule of law,” Kono said. “That international order is now being challenged by unilateral attempts to change the status quo through coercion, military or economically.”
Japan will cooperate with China as long as the latter commits to maintaining democratic standards of government, such as being transparent in government actions, he said.
“There is a great potential for collaboration in infrastructure development in line with international standards, such as transparency, openness, the financial soundness of receiving nations,” Kono said.
Japanese foreign policy towards Russia should also focus on cooperation in order to establish better security in the region, he said.
“We should not forget that Russia is an indispensable stakeholder to address a number of global challenges, whether you like it or not,” Kono said. “I strongly believe the improvement of the relationship with Russia could change the course of the current stalemate in various areas in diplomacy.”
Kono said that his experience as an undergraduate at Georgetown prepared him to become foreign minister. He recounted stories of his seminar with then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and advised Georgetown students to work towards becoming global leaders.
“This is a great place for you to prepare for your future. I encourage you to combine thought and action to develop yourself as a global leader,” Kono said. “Every experience I had here made me who I am today as a Foreign Minister.”

U.S. President Donald Trump’s China policy transforms the West’s historic attitude toward China, former Singaporean diplomat and professor at the National University of Singapore Kishore Mahbubani said at an event entitled “Has the West Lost It?” on Monday in Healy Hall’s Riggs Library.
During the event, Mahbubani discussed his new book “Has the West Lost It? A Provocation.” Victor Cha, the D.S. Song-KF endowed chair in international affairs, moderated the discussion. The Georgetown Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues and the Office of the President co-sponsored the event.
Mahbubani said the U.S.-China trade war that began last spring when Trump put tariffs on Chinese imports demonstrates a shift in U.S. policy towards China.
“The Trump administration is not trying to reach a deal,” he said. “It is trying to alter the playing field in a very fundamental way and that’s a different game.”
According to Mahbubani, the escalation of the trade war came as a surprise to Chinese leaders.
“It has come as a big shock to the Chinese leaders who have come to realize that what is happening now between the U.S. and China is something completely different,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani said that China is ready to work with the United States to end the current trade war.
“The Chinese are prepared to make a deal,” Mahbubani said. “This is the fundamental question: is [the trade war about] a trade deficit, which is one probability or is it about China developing technological capability which they will one day do better than the United States?”
Mahbubani said that an attitude of complacency at the end of the Cold War and the belief that Democracy had triumphed over Communism caused the West to overlook the rise of powers like China.
“The West [went] to sleep at precisely the moment when the rest of the world was waking up,” he said. “At precisely the moment that China and India were waking up.”
The West continued to neglect the growing power of China and its admission into the World Trade Organization in the wake of 9/11, according to Mahbubani
“The effect of 9/11 was that the United States and some European countries marched into wars in the Middle East and got engrossed in wars there and did not notice something more fundamental happening in 2001 which was China’s admission into WTO,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani said China’s admission to the WTO brought an influx of labor to the world market, causing many Western countries to see domestic jobs go over sea and creating the space for leaders like Donald trump to gain power.
“The reason why China’s admission in 2001 into the WTO was far more significant is because according to Western theories of economics, according to Joseph Schumpeter and creative destruction, when you suddenly inject 900,000,000 new workers into the global capitalist system there will be creative destruction so workers lost their jobs,” Mahbubani said. “And then you see fifteen years later the election of Donald Trump.”
Western countries ignored China’s surge to economic power in 2014, according to Mahbubani.
“In 2014, in one of a major historical moment, China’s share [of the global economy] became larger than that of the United States and nobody noticed that that happened,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani explained that he wrote his book to demonstrate that Western countries could lose their standing in global affairs if they do not actively protect the current liberal world order.
“Has the west lost it? And the answer is no. But more accurately, not yet,” Mahbubani said. “Because my big fear, and the reason why I wrote this book now, is that the west could very well lose it if it continues going on autopilot.”
According to Mahbubani, people throughout the world enjoy greater peace and prosperity than any other time in history.
“The biggest truth of our times is that humanity has never been in a better condition than it is today,” Muhbubani said. “Today we are living in the most peaceful time ever in human history.”
Mahbubani recommend that the West adopt a policy of multilateral intervention.
“I am asking for minimalist unilateral interventions and I am asking for maximalist multilateral interventions. So yes, intervene but do it multilaterally.”
In order to achieve this policy of multilateral intervention, the West will have to cooperate with countries with which it may not have otherwise allied, according to Mahbubani.
“You have to work with countries that you are uncomfortable with if you want to solve global problems,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani encouraged Asian countries to assume the responsibility of protecting the current world order because they benefitted the most from it.
“But today, the biggest beneficiaries of this Western created order, the liberal international rules-based order, are the Asian societies. So the Asian societies who have been in one way or another, I’m exaggerating a bit, have been free riders on this liberal international rules-based order have got to stop being free riders.”
Mahbubani said that Asian governments are reluctant to assume the burden of defending the liberal world order but that future Asian governments will have to take responsibility for protecting that world order.
“Unfortunately, no Asian government is, of now, ready and willing to take on the job of custodianship,” Mahbubani said. “The burden is going to fall on the young Asians to take on some the responsibilities that the West used to undertake.”

Indonesia has the potential to become a leader in the global Islamic community, University professor of Indonesian society and culture Bernard Adeney-Risakotta said at an event Oct. 2 in the Intercultural Center.
The discussion, hosted by the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, centered on religion and democracy in Indonesia. Adeney-Risakotta spoke about his new book, “Living in a Sacred Cosmos: Indonesia and the Future of Islam,” which was published in August and addresses the future of Islam in Indonesia. John Esposito, School of Foreign Service professor and founding director of the center, moderated the event.
Indonesia will likely influence Islamic discourse in the future because of the country’s emphasis on preserving Islamic tradition, Adeney-Risakotta said.
“As time goes by, Indonesia is going to have a greater and greater influence on Islam and on the rest of the world, because Indonesians — many Indonesians — are not ashamed of Indonesian Islam. If anything, they think it’s superior to Middle Eastern Islam,” Adeney-Risakotta said. “They do not think that Islam needs to be cleansed from all traditions and cultural expressions. They think that it needs to be preserved and strengthened.”
A rising tide of radicalism is reshaping Indonesian Islam, according to Adeney-Risakotta.
“There’s a lot of people who are very concerned about what is happening,” Adeney-Risakotta said. “There has been a rise, an increase in radicalism, increase in polarization, increase in certain kinds of oppression.”
Western intellectuals’ focus on the radical elements of Indonesian Islam obscure the more secular parts of Indonesian society, according to Adeney-Risakotta.
“I think most Western scholars and most Indonesianists, even Indonesian Indonesianists, very often focus on the rise of radicalism, the rise of intolerance, the rise of conservative Islam in Indonesia and the eclipse of what used to be called the Abangan, or the […] less observant Muslims in Indonesia,” Adeney-Risakotta said. “And I think the focus on that may be really hiding some things that are extremely important for us to pay attention to.”
Indonesia has historically welcomed and tolerated religious diversity because of its multireligious and multiethnic population, Adeney-Riskotta said.
“It was a crossroads for people from all over, and while Europeans powers fought with each other constantly, Indonesia depended on trade — being 17,000 islands, it depended on trade — and so it developed a long tradition of tolerance,” Adeney-Riskotta said.
Still, Indonesia remains culturally separate from what Adeney-Risakotta labels the world’s four “Axial civilizations” — China, India, the Middle East and the West — despite these civilizations’ influences on Indonesia’s history, according to Adeney-Risakotta.
“The four Axial civilizations that laid the foundation for the modern world are all deeply a part of Indonesia, but Indonesia has not become one with any of them,” Adeney-Risakotta said. “It’s not part of China, it’s not part of the Sinosphere, it’s not part of India, even though it was called the Dutch East Indies, it’s not part of Europe and it’s not part of the Middle East. It’s its own creation, which has, I think, something to offer to the rest of the world.”
Indonesians may struggle with their identity as the world and the country continue to develop, rapidly increasing average life expectancy and literacy rates, Adeney-Risakotta said, but he expressed optimism for the future of the country.
“I have a lot of hope for the future of Indonesia,” Adeney-Risakotta said. “There’s a lot of hope for the influence of Indonesia on the rest of the world.”

Members of the Georgetown University community, including students and administrators, are urging the return of Victor Liu (COL ’21), along with his mother and sister, who have all been prohibited by Chinese authorities from leaving the country since June.
Victor Liu and his sister Cynthia Liu joined their mother Sandra Han on a visit to China to see their unwell grandfather in June 2018. Shortly after the family’s arrival, Chinese authorities separated Han from her children and placed her in a black jail, a secret detention facility in China. 
The siblings are being prevented from leaving China in an effort to persuade their father, who is accused of financial crimes, to surrender to Chinese law enforcement, according to The New York Times. The Liu siblings were not detained but are not permitted to leave the country, The New York Times reported.
Georgetown University has contacted the U.S. Department of State, the Chinese foreign ministry, the Lius’ congressional representatives, the U.S. ambassador to China and the Chinese ambassador to the United States about Victor Liu’s inability to return to the United States, according to Georgetown University spokesperson Matt Hill.
“We have intervened on Victor Liu’s behalf with American and Chinese government officials,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown University is deeply committed to Victor’s safe return home and will continue to advocate for his case.” 
University President John J. DeGioia also visited the Liu siblings in Beijing when he travelled to Asia as part of a Georgetown delegation in November. Evan Medeiros, distinguished fellow in U.S.-China studies who formerly served as special assistant to former President Barack Obama and senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, joined DeGioia on the trip. Medeiros was involved in negotiating the releases of U.S. hostages in North Korea during the Obama administration.  
Dean of the School of Foreign Service Joel Hellman advocated for the release of the Liu siblings in a tweet early Thursday morning.
“We call for the lifting of the exit ban from China for @Georgetown student and US citizen Victor Liu & his sister Cynthia,” the tweet reads. 
Before being prohibited from exiting China, Victor Liu had been planning to start his sophomore year at Georgetown, and Cynthia Liu was set to start working at McKinsey & Company in the fall.
Liu Changming, the siblings’ father, stands accused of participating in a $1.4 billion lending fraud at a Chinese state-owned bank, which came under investigation in 2007. Neither Han nor the siblings have been charged with any official crimes. 
Their father cut ties with his family in 2012, according to The New York Times. Chinese officials are attempting to leverage the family to coerce their father to return to China, according to a letter Cynthia Liu wrote to national security adviser John Bolton obtained by The New York Times.
“We are being held here as a crude form of human collateral to induce someone with whom I have no contact to return to China for reasons with which I am entirely unfamiliar,” Cynthia Liu wrote. 
The Chinese foreign ministry defended the detention of Han and the decision to bar the Liu siblings from leaving, citing their status as Chinese citizens.
“The people you mentioned own legal and valid identity documents as Chinese citizens,” the Chinese foreign ministry told The New York Times.
However, China does not recognize dual nationalities and revokes Chinese citizenship upon gaining a foreign citizenship; Han and the Liu siblings all hold U.S. citizenship. Born in California, Victor Liu is one of few individuals on whom China has placed an exit ban born outside of its borders.
The Liu siblings’ situation has attracted the attention of national policymakers, including Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), who is paying close attention to the status of Han and her children, according to a Nov. 27 tweet. 
“My office is aware of Victor’s, Cynthia’s, and Sandra’s situations and is deeply concerned,” the tweet said. “We are working to secure their safe return and continue to be in touch with U.S. officials to ensure a positive outcome.” 
The U.S. State Department has previously expressed opposition to the Chinese government’s use of exit bans to hold U.S. citizens. The State Department issued a travel advisory in January, warning that U.S. travellers may find themselves subject to guidelines imposed by the Chinese government, according to The New York Times. 
The State Department remains in regular contact with the Liu siblings to ensure consular services are available to the siblings, a State Department official wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“The safety and security of American citizens is a top priority for the Department of State,” the official wrote. “We routinely have shared our concern about China’s use of exit bans on American citizens with the Chinese government and will continue to do so until we see a transparent and fair process.” 
The Office of Endowment, where Victor Liu worked on campus, wish to see him back at Georgetown soon, according to Georgetown’s Chief Investment Officer Michael Barry.
“He is a very kind person, and from my experience, someone of integrity,” Barry wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We at the Investment Office are deeply saddened by his situation. We hope for his speedy return and keep him and his family in our prayers.”
Members of Georgetown University’s Asian American Student Association condemned the exit ban, calling it a violation of international human rights. 
“We call on the People’s Republic of China for the unconditional and immediate release of both Victor and Cynthia,” the AASA executive board wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Repeated violations of the most basic of human rights by Chinese authorities, such as in this instance, demand a strong response and constant vigilance.”

Oppressive policies toward women in the Middle East must be combatted, scholars, leaders and activists said at a panel on women’s rights in Iran on Dec. 5.
Iran currently ranks in the bottom third among 153 countries in a women’s well-being and empowerment index created by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, which hosted the event. Iran’s low ranking in the index, which evaluates countries based on peace, security, women’s inclusion and justice, stems from legal discrimination against women in divorce and workplace laws.
The panelists were women’s rights activist Masih Alinejad, actress and human rights activist Nazanin Boniadi, Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute senior fellow Afshin Molavi, author and Georgetown School of Foreign Service centennial fellow Azar Nafisi, and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace senior fellow Karim Sadjadpour.
The event, which was co-moderated by Ambassador Melanne Verveer, the first U.S. ambassador for global women’s issues, and Margaret Brennan, CBS News’ senior foreign affairs correspondent, was hosted in Gaston Hall.
After the formation of the current Islamic Republic of Iran, the government mandated that women cover their hair. The hijab requirement has contributed to a general decline in women’s rights in the country, according to Boniadi. 
“At the inception of the Islamic Republic 39 years ago, tens of thousands of Iranian women demonstrated in opposition to the new government’s compulsory hijab ruling,” Boniadi said. “Their cries were met with batons, lashes, acid thrown in their faces and imprisonment.” 
Nafisi wrote “Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books,” an account of her experiences after returning to Iran during the revolution. Laws that require women in Iran to wear hijabs in public spaces are not merely religious requirements, but a way for the Iranian government to repress and control women, according to Nafisi.
“The hijab in Iran is not about religion. It is about an ideology in order to preserve power. It is uniformity. It is like Mao jackets that people wore in the Republic of China,” Nafisi said. “[The Iranian government] brought this uniformity and they made women into semiotic signs, into political entities, you know. The first thing they did in culture was to delete women.”
Without the mandatory hijab law, some women would choose to expose their heads, according to Nafisi.
“If this was Iranian women’s tradition and we believed in it, why do you have to use guns and jail and punishment and impose a law for them to wear it?” Nafisi said. 
Alinejad, founder of the My Stealthy Freedom campaign against the compulsory hijab, was exiled from Iran after posting an Instagram picture of herself in the country without a hijab. 
Social media gives a voice to women in the Iranian women’s rights movement, according to Alinejad. 
“In Iran, for 40 years, we never had the chance to be seen, to be visible,” Alinejad said. “Through social media we gained our voice back. That is why I always say that every individual woman in Iran can become their own leader and we get successful if every one of us became a headache for the government of Iran.” 
Nafisi has been labelled as Western by Westerners who critique her position as an Iranian woman opposed to compulsory hijab laws and the Iranian government, she said.
“They would look at you and say, ‘But it’s your culture,’ or they would call me ‘Western,’ you know, and ‘an agent of Western imperialism.’” Nafisi said. “As if only Western women want the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.”
Alinejad called for Western women to support Iranian women’s rights despite the common argument that gender inequality is part of Middle Eastern culture and said supporting women’s rights does not make Westerners Islamophobic.
“By calling this our culture, you are insulting us, and culture is not written to stone, it is flexible. It changes generation to generation. Join us and be loud enough,” Alinejad said. “Supporting the women’s rights movement in the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia, in Iran, doesn’t make you Islamophobic.”
Limiting women’s rights can negatively affect the success of a nation’s economy, according to Molavi.
“Show me a country that provides its women with equal rights, both legislatively and culturally, and I’ll show you a successful economy,” Molavi said. 
In addition to oppressing women, the Iranian government also hinders the success of the Iranian economy through its guiding ideologies, according to Sadjadpour.
“It’s a government who their organizing principle isn’t life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, economic prosperity of the people,” Sadjadpour said. “It is death to America, death to Israel, mandatory hijab — and as long as that is your organizing principle, you are always going to fall way below potential.”
Sadjadpour said he believed that some of these ideologies could change, stating that he was optimistic about the values of the younger generation of Iranian men.
“Men essentially sat on the sidelines as women were being beaten up,” Sadjadpour said. “It’s a real source of shame, but I feel optimistic that the younger generation of Iranian men have a much different vision.”

Six Jesuit priests who were at one point associated with Georgetown University have been credibly accused of sexually abusing minors, as determined by the Maryland, Midwest and West provinces of the Society of Jesus in reports released this month.
None of the allegations specify incidents of abuse at Georgetown, although estimated periods of abuse overlap with on-campus assignments, according to the reports.
The Maryland Province’s Dec. 17 report lists priests who face credible accusations of sexual abuse — classified as allegations with “a preponderance of evidence that the allegation is more likely true than not” — as well as priests who were accused of committing abuse but were not investigated. The Maryland Province did not investigate the credibility of an allegation in cases involving the death of an alleged abuser or incomplete historical information, according to the report.
University President John J. DeGioia supported the disclosure by the Maryland Province and said Georgetown is dedicated to taking action against sexual abuse in a universitywide email Dec. 17.
“Our University is deeply committed to preventing and responding to sexual assault and misconduct and to protecting the most vulnerable among us,” DeGioia wrote. “Let us all take part in this responsibility.”
Fr. William J. Walsh, S.J., who was removed from public ministry in 1996, was implicated in multiple credible allegations of sexual abuse believed to have occurred from the 1950s to the 1980s, according to the Maryland Province report. Walsh worked at Georgetown from 1966 to 1967.
In 1996, five sisters reported to the Maryland Province that Walsh, their uncle, had sexually abused each of them 40 years earlier while they were in his care, according to an April 1998 CNN interview with one of the sisters and the sisters’ attorney. Walsh was called back to the United States from his teaching position in China and removed from ministry later that year.
He then worked at the Woodstock Theological Center, an independent Jesuit-run research institute housed at Georgetown that closed in 2013, from 1996 to 1998, according to the Maryland Province report.
The sisters made the allegations public in 1998 to call for Walsh’s dismissal from the clergy, according to the CNN interview. Following the public allegations, Walsh did not live in the on-campus Jesuit residence and had been placed on administrative leave, according to a 1998 university news release reported in the Georgetown Voice. The news release also said Walsh did not engage with students in his duties at Woodstock.
Fr. Michael Barber, S.J., who was removed from public ministry in 1994, pled guilty to harassment by inappropriate touching after the Maryland Province received an allegation against him, according to the report. The allegation was believed to have occurred in 1994. Barber served at the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital from 1976 to 1978.
Walsh and Barber are both still living. Jesuit priests with credible accusations of abuse live in supervised environments unassociated with any Jesuit institution and undergo risk reduction programs monitored by the province review board, according to the Maryland Province.
The Maryland Province reported that it received one allegation of sexual abuse against Fr. Martin Casey, S.J., estimated to have occurred in 1959. Casey lived in the Georgetown Jesuit community from 1973 to 1997 and worked at the university from 1997 until his death in 2006. The Maryland Province did not investigate the allegation for credibility but determined there was a “reasonable possibility” that the abuse occurred.
The Midwest Province released its own report the same day as the Maryland Province, naming 65 Jesuits with an “established” accusation of sexual abuse, an allegation with a “reasonable certainty” of truth. Two names mentioned in the report held connections to Georgetown: Fr. Thomas Gannon, S.J., and Bernard Knoth, who was removed from public ministry in 2003 and permanently dismissed from the clergy in 2009. Both have faced more than one accusation of sexual abuse, according to the report.
The Midwest Province detailed multiple allegations of sexual abuse against Gannon ranging from 1961 to 1998. These included a 1983 incident in Gary, Ind., just before Gannon moved to Woodstock, where he worked from 1983 to 1986. Gannon died in 2011.
Allegations of sexual abuse against Knoth initially surfaced in 2003 and range from 1986 to 1988, during his time as principal of Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis. He was assigned to Georgetown in 1990.
At Georgetown, Knoth served as a lecturer, chaplain-in-residence and associate dean of Georgetown College from 1990 to 1995. Knoth was also contacted in 2000 for the position of university president.
The West Province named Fr. Augustine Ferretti, S.J., who was assigned to Georgetown from 1944 to 1947, on a list of credibly accused priests released Dec. 7. The West Province reported that, in 2009, it received allegations of abuse against Ferretti that ranged from 1952 to 1976. Ferretti died in 1982.
The Maryland Province has affirmed its commitment to significant reforms for the protection of minors in light of the abuse crisis, according to Fr. Robert Hussey, S.J., provincial superior of the Maryland Province.
“We are deeply sorry for the harm we have caused to victims and their families,” Hussey wrote in the Dec. 17 news release. “We view the disclosure today of our shameful history as part of our commitment now to preventing abuse.”
Georgetown supports the transparency of the provinces in publishing the reports and encourages survivors of sexual abuse to access on-campus resources, according to a university spokesperson.
“Releasing this list of names is one step in acknowledging and addressing the terrible history of abuse, and there is much more work to do,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown is dedicated to preventing and responding to sexual assault and misconduct and encourages all members of our community to utilize available resources to report sexual misconduct or get support.”
The release of the lists comes amid a movement to revoke the honorary Georgetown degrees of former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who has been the subject of multiple allegations of sexual abuse, and Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who was named in an August Pennsylvania grand jury report for covering up abuse. The university has assembled a working group to examine the honorary degrees given to McCarrick and Wuerl but has not yet announced a decision.

Wookjae Jung (SFS ’15) is one of 147 students worldwide to win the Schwarzman Scholarship, which provides recipients with full tuition to attend Tsinghua University in Beijing for a yearlong master’s degree in public policy, economics and business, or international studies.
Roughly 5 percent of this year’s 2,800 applicants received a scholarship, making it “one of the most selective postgraduate scholarships in the world,” according to a post on Georgetown’s website.
As past of the scholarship, Jung will complete classes in leadership, Chinese history and government at Tsinghua. Jung is excited to learn not only of China’s history spanning thousands of years but more about its evolving modern society, he wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“China is more of a civilization than a country. The history and diversity are something that I am excited to explore once I’m in Beijing,” Jung wrote. “I want to know what China is like today, and get to know the Chinese people and the society of our generation.”
Jung was a competitive candidate because he embodies qualities the Schwarzman Scholarship looks for in its candidates, according to Laura Perille, assistant director of the Georgetown Office of Fellowships, Awards and Resources. Specifically, Perille commended Jung for his leadership potential and ability to connect individuals from diverse backgrounds.
“Wookjae Jung stands out for that potential, having not only played a critical role in high-level government negotiations and ventures through his work with the Ministry of National Defense in South Korea but also created and managed the Salon Nomad Project, a social networking platform for artists, professionals, and businesses,” Perille wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Although the Schwarzman does not require university endorsement, GOFAR works closely with applicants from Georgetown to ensure they are competitive in the application process, according to Perille.
Jung majored in international political economy in the School of Foreign Service and later became a Korean Air Force officer following his graduation. Jung is the fourth Georgetown graduate to receive the scholarship since its inception in 2016. Former winners include Jose Luna (SFS ’15), Zachary Kay (SFS ’16) and Zezhou Cai (GRD ’18).
Jung intends to use his experiences from the scholarship to allow him to expand on his work with the Korean Air Force, he told Georgetown.
“I wish to continue doing that kind of work, presenting new solutions that will bring actors together towards an optimal social goal,” Jung said.

Displaying the effects of increasingly frequent environmental disasters and engaging religious communities is necessary to motivate action against climate change, George Steinmetz, a freelance photographer, and Evan Berry, an American University associate professor of philosophy and religion, said at a Jan. 23 event.
Using aerial photography that can show the environment on large scales is one of the best ways to motivate the average citizen to combat climate change because it displays climate change’s effects on humans, Steinmetz said, speaking of his work.
“What I was trying to do was show the scope of the problem,” Steinmetz said. “I try to take pictures where there’s something human that you can relate to.”
The event, titled “Religion and Climate Change: A Visual and Scholarly Representation” was hosted by the Pulitzer Center in collaboration with the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, which studies the intersection of religion, ethics, and public life.
Religious elements are woefully absent from popular discourse on climate change, according to Director of the Berkeley Center Shaun Casey.
“Many of today’s international crises have a strong religious component, yet media coverage often omits or oversimplifies these complexities and nuances,” Casey said. “A deep examination of faith and values is central and critical to addressing today’s global challenges.”
Journalism and religion both use human-centered narratives that can catalyze social organization, according to Berry, who studies issues of community action.
“One thing that journalism and religion have in common is that they’re both ways of telling stories about how different groups of people experience what’s going on places,” Berry said.
Berry has previously examined religion’s influence on both climate change and environmentalism in his 2015 book, “Devoted to Nature: The Religious Roots of Environmentalism.” 
Religion is an integral to climate change’s impacts, Berry wrote, alongside co-authors Willis Jenkins and Luke Beck Kreider in a July 2018 article “Religion and Climate Change.”
“Understanding the cultural dimensions of climate change requires understanding its religious aspects,” Berry wrote with his co-authors.
Steinmetz, who often captures aerial images and landscapes, was assigned by The New York Times Magazine to find the best visual representations of climate change on each continent — a search that led him to photograph Iceland, China and Western Africa. Steinmetz also followed several American natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey and three recent California wildfires.
His photographs were originally used for an article in The Times Magazine in Aug. 2018 titled “Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change.”
Steinmetz said using moving and still pictures to supplement the article was both effective and powerful.
The Pulitzer Center has designed a model curriculum around the “Losing Earth” article that can be used in classroom ranging from elementary school to college. The project teaches students journalism skills through stories on climate change.
Georgetown University and the Berkley Center are members of the Pulitzer Center’s campus consortium network, which aims to engage students and faculty in conversations about important issues and how they are covered in the media.
Visual mediums of journalism such as photography and documentary film have great potential to communicate the impacts of climate change, Berry and panel members said.
“I’m a big believer in documentary film. I think it’s a really important and powerful tool, both long and short documentaries,” Berry said. “They can tell stories in a way that isn’t merely just images, but also helps people sympathize with characters who come to life.”
Both Berry and Steinmetz agreed citizens of developed countries like the United States have the responsibility to help others combat climate change.
“There’s a set of conversations about what we ought to do in response to climate change that have to do with lowering our emissions and there’s also a set of conversations about what we ought to do that are related to helping communities adapt to rapidly changing environments,” Berry said. 
The United Nations has identified the growing problem of climate refugees — migrants who have been forced to leave their homelands due to issues related to changing climate patterns, such as flooding, and are disproportionately poor — as few systems to relocate individuals displaced by environmental disasters yet function at high capacities.
At the commencement ceremony for the School of Foreign Service’s class of 2018, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said climate change would be one of the most pressing issues younger generations will need to tackle.
Steinmetz said that while he thinks the photographs are compelling, he is unsure if they can motivate individuals to act.
“I think people will look at these pictures and think, ‘Wow, that’s a really big problem,’ but, to be honest, I don’t know if that makes them think, ‘What can I personally do?’” Steinmetz said. “But I think it comes down to what we can do individually.”

The United States must engage more with the global community to rebuild weakening alliances with regions such as Europe and Asia, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said at an event in Gaston Hall on Wednesday.
Throughout her speech, Clinton said that President Donald Trump’s administration’s decision to backtrack on previous deals and negotiations has strained relationships with other countries, putting the U.S. reputation at risk.
“At some point, as another nation, you think, ‘Can we trust them?’ It’s not just administration to administration, it’s the United States of America, it’s our government. It’s about giving our word, it’s about following through,” Clinton said. “I think we have to be smarter about how we sustain our involvements and commitments going forward.”
Clinton’s speech was a part of the “Future of Diplomacy” symposium hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service at the McCourt School of Public Policy and the School of Foreign Service as a part of the Lloyd George Centennial Lectures, which began February 2018 to celebrate the upcoming SFS centennial anniversary. Clinton’s keynote was moderated by Bill Burns, former U.S. ambassador to Russia and U.S. deputy secretary of state.
Clinton’s keynote marks her third return to Georgetown since she lost her bid for the 2016 presidential election. In her 2017 and 2018 appearances, Clinton presented the annual Hillary Rodham Clinton Awards for Advancing Women in Peace and Security, which honor the peace-building work and empowerment efforts of recipients.
During a time when there is a lack of satisfaction with both the U.S. government and the governments of numerous European countries, there is a strong need for alliances between the two regions, Clinton said.
“Democracy is going through some growing pains. We are going through some growing pains, and so are the Europeans,” Clinton said. “When that happens we need our friends. We need people who we have worked with and counted on, and I think the division that is being unfortunately driven between the United States and Europe is going to haunt us.”
Trump threatened that the United States would withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance of 29 countries in North America and Europe, if allies resisted his demands for additional military spending at the NATO summit meeting last July. Over the course of 2018, Trump told senior administration officials multiple times that he wanted to withdraw from the alliance, according to The New York Times.
Clinton warned against the Trump administration’s rhetoric on NATO, which puts the longstanding alliance between the United States and Europe at risk.
“When you look at what is happening in Europe, it should be a great concern to any American,” Clinton said. “The fact that our current administration is almost egging on the breakup of NATO and to be in a hostile relationship with people who share a lot of our values who we have gone through a lot with, strikes me as counterproductive, and as I said, essentially dangerous.”
The United States is not only neglecting its European allies, but is also allowing its allies in Asia and the developing world to falter, according to Clinton. 
For the United States to repair weakening relationships in Asia, it must refocus attention to restore balance in a way that includes long-term U.S. engagement, according to Clinton.
“We are not doing everything we should to have this kind of balance that I think we need,” Clinton said. “We talked about pivoting to Asia, to rebalance, but all of this means that you got to stay engaged for the long run, not just sporadically.”
A lack of U.S. involvement across Asia, Latin America and Africa has allowed China to become a frontrunner in influencing these regions, Clinton said.
“We are losing the influence contest to China,” Clinton said. “They are engaged in an enormous amount of cultural diplomacy, of funding projects in Latin America, in Africa and elsewhere, and we are not competing.”
Clinton specifically noted that Beijing’s “Belt and Road Initiative” is enjoying a growing influence in global politics. Also known as “One Belt, One Road,” the initiative is a strategy by the Chinese government to develop infrastructure and investments across four continents, linking China to the nations of Southeast Asia, the Gulf countries and North Africa.
Maintaining developmental and financial aid in Central American countries could not only improve diplomatic ties with countries such as Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, but also help decrease the effects of drug trafficking in the region, Clinton said.
“If we spent even a relatively minor amount of money of the federal government’s budget in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, dealing with some of their problems and working against corruption, then all of this talk about poor, desperate people fleeing gang violence and drug traffickers would change into a different conversation,” Clinton said.
The Trump administration pushed to end a humanitarian program that was enacted in 2001 following the devastating earthquakes in El Salvador and allowed Salvadorans to live and work legally in the United States. However, an injunction from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in Oct. 2018 blocked the Department of Homeland Security from implementing and enforcing Trump’s plan. 
Clinton remains optimistic, however, that young people who engage in careers in public service can both help shape the future and reassert the importance of supporting diplomacy. 
“There’s a lot of hard work that has to be done, but there’s also a lot of room for imagination,” Clinton said. “It’s one of the most exciting times to be looking at a career in public service. I would hope that what we’ve done today will lead to an even longer conversation so that even more students will understand the importance of supporting diplomacy.”

President Donald Trump’s actions have fractured diplomatic relationships that will take future executives many years to repair, said Susan Rice, U.S. national security adviser under former President Barack Obama. 
The United States should better communicate its dedication to allies, a facet of diplomacy that has been neglected by the Trump administration, according to Rice.
“We have to stabilize and invest further in our relationships,” Rice said. “We have been unsteady in recent years in terms of signaling our reliability, our staying power, our commitment.” 
Rice, who is also the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was joined at the Feb. 27 event by Stephen Hadley, U.S. national security adviser under former President George W. Bush. Hadley previously served as an assistant secretary of defense for global strategic affairs under former President George H.W. Bush.
The United States withdrew its signature from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement between 12 member countries, in January 2017. The remaining members negotiated a new agreement — the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership — in March 2018, disproving the predictions of many policymakers who thought that the trade deal would collapse without the participation of the United States.
Trump’s decision to exit global agreements like the TPP and the Paris climate agreement, an international effort to combat climate change signed by 194 states and the European Union, have delegitimized his leadership, Rice said.
“By withdrawing from the TPP, we created a vacuum,” Rice said. “These decisions have been weakening our strategic hand and weakening our global leadership.” 
The Trump administration has also withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal, a 2014 agreement that limited the country’s nuclear activities and allowed international inspectors to monitor compliance.
The administration’s near-singular focus on the Iran nuclear deal has drawn attention away from other, more pressing threats that Iran poses to the United States, according to Rice. 
“We all agree that in an ideal world we would have addressed not only the nuclear threat from Iran, but all the threats from Iran,” Rice said. “I do want to point out that by pulling out of the Iran deal, we’re not focusing on those other threats now.”
Policymakers have criticized recent sanctions by the United States, including the 2017 Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which imposed sanctions on Iran, North Korea and Russia, as vague and lacking specific policy outcomes, according to an October 2018 news release by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
The tendency of U.S. leaders to resort to sanctions as a means to influence other countries is ineffective, according to Hadley.
“Sanctions have become our favorite tool because they don’t have a cost and they put us on the record for having done something,” Hadley said. “Our allies are getting sick of it.”
The event was organized by the School of Foreign Service as a part of the Lloyd George Centennial Lectures, which launched in February 2018 to celebrate the upcoming SFS centennial. Charles Kupchan, Georgetown professor of international affairs, moderated the event, which was held in Gaston Hall.
Trump’s approach to foreign policy, which he defines as “America first,” has enabled Russia and China to assume positions of global leadership, according to Rice.
“We have ourselves not been as active and present in taking advantage of our leadership potential, diplomatic muscle,” Rice said. “We’ve backed up a bit, and China and Russia have taken advantage of the vacuum.”
The Trump administration has departed from previous administrations, which forged close ties with China, by using a more aggressive stance that has hurt the U.S.-China relationship, Rice said. 
“We are not posturing ourselves from a position of maximum strength to deal with the challenge that China poses,” Rice said. “Future administrations will need to do a lot of repair work and bridge-building.”
Trump held a second summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, Vietnam, this week. Trump’s more aggressive, assertive approach to diplomacy with North Korea has proven more effective than the approaches of previous administrations, according to Hadley. 
“There’s a lot of criticism of the Trump administration. He’s been right about some of the things that he did. I think he was right to be blustery when he came in,” Hadley said. “The three previous administrations who have tried to negotiate with North Korea haven’t been able to get them to uphold their agreement.”

“We have a nightmarish fear that Father Walsh may sexually molest innocent female students, and little girls in the Georgetown area.”
Sarah Lynne Landsdale was 5 years old when her uncle, Fr. William J. Walsh, S.J., first molested her while wearing his clerical clothing. Approximately 40 years later, in 1996, she and four of her sisters told the Maryland Province that Walsh had abused each of them hundreds of times. And two years later, in 1998, she and her sisters called a press conference to plead for their uncle’s removal from Georgetown University’s campus.
Walsh, who served as a Georgetown professor during the 1966-67 school year and conducted research on campus from 1996 until 1998, sexually abused minors in at least four locations — including Washington, D.C. — over the course of four decades, according to a December 2018 report issued by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus that deemed allegations against him credible.
Among the survivors of Walsh’s sexual abuse are five of his nieces, who brought their allegations to the province in July 1996 while he was working in China. The province removed Walsh from the ministry that year, prohibiting him from saying Mass and transferred him to the Woodstock Theological Center, a Jesuit-run research facility in Ida Ryan Hall on campus, where he worked until 1998.
From the 1940s through the 1960s, Walsh, who died in December, abused each of the five sisters hundreds of times after their father passed away when they were between ages 6 and 14, according to public statements the sisters made in 1998.
Walsh researched theology as an administrative assistant at Woodstock from 1996 to 1998. During this time period, he lived in the Woodstock Residential Community, two blocks from Georgetown’s front gates.
Walsh also underwent a treatment program while working at Woodstock, according to a Maryland Province statement released in response to the Landsdale sisters’ April 20, 1998 press conference. The program included attending weekly individual and group therapy, contacting a sponsor on a regular basis and spending one week at at treatment center in Silver Spring, Md., every year, according to the 1998 statement of Susan Lansdale Peters, one of Walsh’s nieces, based on her conversations with the Maryland Province.
The university first learned of sexual abuse allegations against Walsh through news reports of the Landsdales’ press conferences, according to a March 13 email from a university spokesperson.
Georgetown responded to the sisters’ statements in a memo released the same day, offering sympathy and clarifying that Walsh’s employment was not directly linked to the university.
The statement did not address Walsh’s access to Georgetown students while he worked in the Woodstock Theological Center, Denis Ventriglia, the Landsdales’ lawyer at the time, said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
“Georgetown University should be asked: What vetting of Father Walsh did Georgetown University perform prior to allowing him in the Woodstock Theological Center?” Ventriglia said.
Two decades later, the university declined to comment on any oversight of hiring at Woodstock at the time, saying only that the Maryland Province owned and operated the research center.
The 1998 university statement also did not reference Walsh’s past work as a Georgetown professor.
Decades earlier, Walsh taught “Christian Marriage,” an undergraduate theology class at Georgetown during the 1966-67 academic year. University President John J. DeGioia noted Walsh’s year teaching at Georgetown in a universitywide email following the release of the Maryland Province’s report.
Walsh also lived in the Georgetown Jesuit Community from 1974 to 1976, an assignment undocumented by the Maryland Province but confirmed through the Official Catholic Directories from those years.
Though there are no abuse accusations against Walsh from his time at Georgetown, the Maryland Province has documented credible allegations from the 1950s through the 1980s, including instances of abuse in Washington, D.C.
Five of the Landsdale sisters were abused by Walsh, but for decades, each was unaware of their uncle’s abuse of the others. While assigned to Xiamen University in China in 1996, Walsh sent a letter to a family member describing his sexual fantasies about an orphaned 3-year-old girl, according to Peters.
“I felt nauseated when I thought about this poor defenseless Chinese child,” Peters said in her 1998 statement. “I also finally realized after all my years of mental anguish and suffering, that he was to be blamed for the molestations on me, not I.”
In their 50s, five of the Lansdale sisters — Walsh’s nieces — realized they had all been molested by their uncle only after reading the letter. In July 1996, Peters contacted the Maryland Province in Baltimore to report the letter and their abuse as children, according to the Maryland Province’s 1998 statement.
The Maryland Province did not remove Walsh from Woodstock until the sisters’ public statements two years later. At that point, he was sent to live in Ferdinand Wheeler House, a Jesuit residence in Baltimore, where his movement and actions were restricted by the Maryland Province. He was then transferred to Colombiere Jesuit Community in Baltimore, where he lived until his death.
Fr. John Langan, S.J., a friend of Walsh’s who worked with him at Woodstock and lived with him at Colombiere, was surprised by the accusations against Walsh. Langan is a philosophy professor at Georgetown and serves as the university’s Cardinal Bernardin Chair of Catholic Social Thought.
“He was a very kind, helpful person, rather disciplined and dignified but also quite good humored, and he could be quite funny and had a great love of birds,” Langan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “This was a situation which I think was bound to be puzzling because the general patterns of the man’s life were quite praiseworthy, and I don’t know that anybody would find it easy to fit the accusations into the general picture of how he lived and dealt with people.”
Walsh previously had a “problem” with an individual and received three to four months of psychiatric care before Peters reported her and her sisters’ abuse to the Jesuits in 1996, according to Peters’ statement.
Walsh abused one of the sisters, Victoria Landsdale Long, over 200 times throughout her youth, usually while wearing his collar, according to Long’s 1998 statement.
“Father Walsh would get me alone to take advantage of my innocence and molest me,” Long said. “I remember how he always had such a soft, trusting, smooth voice while his hands, trembling, did sinful outrageous acts to my young virginal body.”
One of Long’s sisters, Mary Therese Landsdale Williams, recounted similar abusive encounters with Walsh, whom she referred to as “Uncle Billy,” in her 1998 statement, written with two of her sisters.
“Father Walsh, also our Uncle Billy, took advantage of our youth and vulnerabilities for his own perverted sexual pleasure and left us with defective souls. It disgusts us to think that our childhood was sacrificed for his moments of sick pleasures,” Williams said. “We have had to pick up our shattered lives with the fact we are forever changed.”
In 1997, Peters filed a criminal complaint against Walsh in Prince George’s County, Md., which was dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired.
Before Walsh died at 95 in December, he lived comfortably at Colombiere Jesuit Community in Baltimore with Langan.
“It is fairly new and it’s a quite pleasant, well-designed complex. It’s a good location; it’s within the city of Baltimore,” Langan said. “There are a lot of birds, a lot of trees and very pleasant to live in.”
Colombiere, which opened in 2011, houses about 40 retired Jesuits. The community is within a one-mile radius of four primary schools.

I was step sister to the Landsdale sisters and did not know this had happened until July of 2020.  I am deeply saddened by the news. Walsh’s sister was the most wonderful step mother a girl could possibly hope for, and a wonderful example for her 6 girls. How tragic for his survivors.

Increased commitment to international economic cooperation from world powers is necessary to protect the advantages of globalism, according to a March 13 panel of economic experts that included the former president of the World Bank.
Leaders need to fight to preserve free international trade in light of increasing protectionism, especially in the United States and Europe, according to Gita Gopinath, economic counsellor and director of research development at the International Monetary Fund.
“When you think of the benefits to the global economy of international trade, they’ve been robust, when you think of the number of people that have been raised from poverty because of this kind of integration,” Gopinath said. “Trade is a good thing and it is a thing worth preserving.” 
Titled “The Future of the Global Economy,” the panel addressed fears of economic protectionism, American disengagement from global affairs and a continuing trade war between the United States and China.
Caroline Atkinson, an expert in international economics and former head of global policy at Google, moderated the panel, which included Gopinath; Robert Zoellick, former president of the World Bank; and Adam Tooze, Columbia University professor and author of the book “Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World.”
Despite globalization’s immense benefits, policymakers still need to create solutions to minimize its unavoidable consequences, Gopinath said. 
“Going forward, there absolutely needs to be a better response to how globalization affects different communities,” Gopinath said. “But we have to recognize the fact that even if we have the best possible multilateral negotiators out there, we are never going to solve the problem that there are going to be winners and losers.”
Tooze also pushed for renewed global economic integration and criticized Europe for shying away from increased globalization. 
“When it comes to the question of Europe, obviously the answer has got to be yes. Yes Europe can do more, Europe should do more,” Tooze said. “It is extraordinary that it has retreated.”
In recent years, anti-globalist movements have gained influence in European politics, challenging systems of continental economic integration in the face of increasing international trade. The United Kingdom Independence Party successfully campaigned for the U.K. to exit the European Union in 2016, and far-right parties like The National Rally in France have received large gains in the share of votes in parliamentary and presidential elections.
Zoellick echoed calls for rule-based international cooperation and encouraged continued U.S. engagement and normalized relations with China.
“My point is not that we should ignore their behaviors, but the idea that we can’t work with the Chinese to set up rules and improve behavior, I think, is mistaken,” Zoellick said.
President Donald Trump has imposed $250 billion of tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for perceived unfair trading practices, and China has responded by imposing tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods, according to CNBC. Currently, U.S. negotiators are meeting with Chinese officials to negotiate an end to the trade war.
The United States cannot avoid engagement in the economies of other countries like China, according to Zoellick.
“The United States and other key players cannot avoid making these choices,” Zoellick said. “Inaction is a form of action, and there are various forms of destructive action that we may also see taking place today.”

Developing countries have less incentive to model their economies after the United States and allies following the success of China’s economy amid global stagnation, according to international economist Dambisa Moyo.
People around the globe are increasingly skeptical of a Western model of markets and democracy. Distinct from the West’s emphasis on market liberalization and free enterprises, the Chinese model adopts a form of state-led capitalism. This is particularly relevant as countries in Africa face a choice between the Western and Chinese models of economic development, according to Moyo.
“We have now different models of geopolitics and economics, China being one example, that has proven themselves able to deliver economic growth in a sustained way and move hundreds of people out of poverty,” Moyo said in her March 19 keynote address.
Economic downturns across the globe have compounded skepticism towards market capitalism and liberal democracy, according to Moyo.
“Fundamentally, we are in an economic situation where economic growth has slowed and continue to slow, and we’ve run out of bullets,” Moyo said. “We’ve used a lot of traditional tools of economics, both in terms of monetary policies, like interest rates, and also fiscal policies.”
Fears of persistent weak economic performances and economic stagnation led the International Monetary Fund to cut its prediction of global economic growth in 2019 from 3.7 percent growth rate to 3.5 percent. In developing countries, the IMF predicted a decrease in economic growth due to trade tensions, increasing U.S. interest rates and volatile oil prices.
Moyo named six challenges that require solutions to prevent economic slowdowns and sustain growth: demographic changes, technological development, income inequality, natural resource scarcity, debt and productivity growth.
The keynote address was part of the Lannan Spring Literary Symposium and Festival titled “Africa Imagines: Reversing the Gaze,” which aimed to provide African perspectives on the continent’s economic development and global affairs. 
Hosted by the Lannan Foundation, Georgetown University’s Lecture Fund and the African studies program, the keynote address delivered by Dambisa Moyo focuses on international development and sustainable economic growth. Born in Zambia, Moyo is a global economist and worked at the World Bank in Washington, D.C. From 1993 to 1995, she co-authored the World Bank’s annual development report. Currently, she serves on the board of Barclays Bank.
Despite differences between the Western and Chinese models identified by Moyo, both face persistent issues of growing income inequality, she said.
“The biggest puzzle is that these two countries, number one and number two with complete different political systems and economic systems, have roughly the same Gini coefficient, which is the measurement of income inequality.”
In order to maintain the benefits that economic growth has granted countless citizens of developing countries, their governments must reckon with resource scarcity and excessive debt for sustainable development amid demographic growth and environmental challenges, according to Moyo.
“We have to figure out a way to ensure that people are going to be able to continue to enjoy improvements in their living standards, even though arable land, potable water, the supply of minerals and energy are increasingly becoming a challenge,” Moyo said. 
All of these considerations present important questions to world leaders who face important crossroads between liberal democracy and protectionism, according to Moyo.
“We are living at a time when the world is becoming more fractured; people are becoming more protectionist in terms of trade, in terms of ideas, in terms of movements of people, in terms of movements of capital,” Moyo said. “Globalization is under threat. The question is, ‘How do we move on from here?’”

Mono Diner, located on Wisconsin Avenue NW in Georgetown, unofficially opened March 4 following multiple cases of property mishandling, lawsuits and corporate conflicts over the past few decades involving its owner Mohammad Esfahani. 
The diner, which aims to recreate the atmosphere of the golden age of Hollywood, remains open from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Mono also operates between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. for the remainder of the week and between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Sundays. A date has not yet been set for the restaurant’s official opening, even though the diner began serving patrons March 4, according to Harmon. 
The diner’s hours are designed to accommodate late-night drinkers and Georgetown University students, according to Mono Diner supervisor Neil Harmon.
“We’re trying to take advantage of Georgetown’s great nightlife,” Harmon said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Since opening, the restaurant has also been popular at early morning hours during the week, according to Harmon. Mono Diner distinguishes itself from other Georgetown dining establishments because of its attention to clients and all-day breakfast menu, Harmon said. 
Eric Spruill-Jenkins, the former general manager and leading chef of Mono Diner, recently left his positions with reasons for his departure unknown, according to Harmon. 
Spruill-Jenkins, formerly a corporate trainer at a since-closed pizza restaurant in Maryland, met Esfahani through a work contact. Despite severing ties with Mono Diner, Spruill-Jenkins still plans to work with Esfahani to create branches of the fast-food branch All About Burger in Chinatown, the Ballston Quarter and Virginia, according to D.C. Eater. 
Esfahani previously owned stores on M Street NW, including Mon Cheri Cafe, where Sprinkles now stands, and Tahoga, where Le Pain Quotidien is now located, according to a local news network. 
Esfahani leased another property located on Wisconsin Avenue in 2002 as part of his earliest venture into opening a diner in Georgetown. However, the mid-19th century building collapsed shortly after he assumed ownership of the building after he placed a tar machine on the roof. Esfahani was fined $1,000 for the damages, and the diner he had planned to establish at the location was never built, local media reported. 
Esfahani publicly denied any responsibility in the building’s collapse, even refuting that he had ownership of building at the time, though city permits indicated these claims were false, according to the Patch.
In 2011, Esfahani leased another address on Wisconsin Avenue NW where he planned to open a franchise of a local burger chain, Z-Burger, according to The Washington Post. The entire back of this building collapsed in November 2011. 
Although Esfahani claimed that this damage was caused by a water leak in the property next door, a Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs inspector determined that the collapse was most likely caused by removing too much dirt from underneath the footings of the building’s north and south walls, according to local media.
Following the collapse, Esfahani hired workers to pour a new concrete slab. A Washington, D.C. DCRA inspector, who visited while the work was being performed, found that the contractors were operating without a permit. Esfahani denied that his contractors were performing work illegally and claimed that he had a permit to perform the work, according to local media. 
The Esfahani brothers ultimately split with Z-Burger co-founder Peter Tabibian after Tabibian claimed they shut him out of the day-to-day operations of their Z-Burger branch. The dispute ended in a lawsuit, which determined that the Esfahani brothers had to rebrand their restaurants, according to The Washington Post. 
While Esfahani attempted to reconstruct 1424 Wisconsin Avenue without a permit in 2011 and again in 2013, no outstanding claims or issues exist that would prevent Mono Diner from operating legally, according to Tim Wilson, spokesperson for the DCRA. 
“There’s nothing that should keep them from running a 30-seat restaurant that can fit 37 people,” Wilson said. “They’re all good, unless something changes.”

Comedian and political commentator Hasan Minhaj reflected on the role of identity in his comedy and called for the inclusion of diverse perspectives in the media industry March 28.
Both of Minhaj’s parents immigrated to the United States from India and raised Minhaj in the Muslim tradition. In his first stand-up comedy special, “Homecoming King,” which was released in 2017, Minhaj focused on his immigrant family upbringing and experience with racism around his Indian Muslim identity.
Minhaj said his identities as a Muslim and a first-generation American encourage him to define himself on inclusive terms.
“I’ve never defined myself being Indian and being like that means, ‘I’m not Pakistani, I’m not Sri Lankan,’ I’ve never defined it that way,” Minhaj said at the event. “India has dozens of languages and hundreds of different ethnic groups and identities. I’ve tried to define it by inclusive principles, not exclusive principles.”
Held in Gaston Hall, the event was hosted by the South Asian Society and co-sponsored by 14 other campus groups and offices, including Lecture Fund and the Muslim Student Association. The event featured a discussion between Minhaj, SAS President Vishal Menon (MSB ’19) and former SAS Presidents Vinoda Basnayake (MSB ’03) and Bhavya Jha (SFS ’17) and was followed by questions from the audience.
Minhaj hosts a weekly news-comedy show, “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,” which premiered on Netflix last October, making Minhaj the first Indian-American host of a weekly comedy show. The show has covered topics including the 2019 Indian general election and political censorship in China. He has also commented on the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in fall 2018, in an episode the Saudi Arabian government demanded Netflix remove.
Minhaj also previously served as a senior correspondent for “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” and was the featured comedian at the 2017 White House Correspondents’ Dinner.
Leading roles held by members of minority communities increased 13.6 percent from the 2011-2012 to the 2015-2016 seasons, according to the 2018 Hollywood Diversity Report from the University of California, Los Angeles. The increase in diversity has been significant not only on the screen, but also during the production process, according to Minhaj.
“Over the last five or six years there has been a big push for inclusion and diversity in the writers’ rooms and in casting in shows, which I think has been a big win for everybody. I’ve seen that shift, and that has been really great,” Minhaj said. “A lot of time people think that inclusion and diversity is just in front of the camera, but there has been a lot of behind-the-camera stuff, in terms of the creation of the ideas producing the projects and all that stuff; that is a big deal.”
Universities and other communities should uplift diverse performers and empower new voices to share their perspective and humor, according to Minhaj.
“I think the good thing, and I think the thing that Georgetown and a lot of schools can tap into, is just give that stage to a diversity of voices,” Minhaj said. “Whether it’s South Asian female voices, whether it’s queer voices, let those performers perform.”
The “Patriot Act” news team and writers seek to amplify underreported stories that shed a light on little-known but nonetheless important issues, according to Minhaj. 
“The two biggest things that I try to look for on story are number one: hooking a story that makes people go, ‘Oh my God. How did I not know that? How was I just kind of walking around in my day to day life not knowing that?’ Or two: it’s a story that makes people go, ‘Oh my God. thank you for saying that,’” Minhaj said. 
Minhaj has been outspoken about college admissions practices on his Netflix show, criticizing a lawsuit by Asian-Americans suing Harvard University over the university’s admissions policy. In the show’s premiere episode, Minhaj accused the plaintiffs of potentially jeopardizing affirmative action with their suit, which alleges the university discriminates against Asian-Americans in its admission process.
In an interview with The Hoya before his event, Minaj commented on his views on the recent admissions scandal affecting Georgetown.
A March 12 Department of Justice indictment alleged that former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst accepted bribes from parents in an admissions scheme involving seven other universities. Ernst falsely designated at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, according to the indictment.
The admissions cases should start a dialogue around the value universities place on legacy admission, according to Minhaj. 
“I think it has opened up a conversation around legacy admissions and I think that that is a big topic, especially because we are talking about meritocracy and everyone having an even playing field when they are applying to go to school,” Minhaj said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Minhaj said the DOJ allegations of admissions fraud at Georgetown and other elite universities did not shock him.
“I wasn’t surprised at all,” Minhaj said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think we saw a lot of these stories coming out from the sports world before, and now that something so public is happening in academia I think, you know, I was disappointed to hear about it but I wasn’t surprised.”

The Woodstock Theological Center moved into Old Ryan, now known as Ida Ryan Hall, in 1978. Over the next several decades, three priests credibly accused of sexual misconduct would work at Woodstock, a Jesuit-run research institution housed on Georgetown’s campus. All three lived in the Woodstock Theological Residence, two blocks away from the university’s front gates. 
Nineteen years after the center’s opening, Woodstock hired Fr. William J. Walsh, S.J., who was later found to have committed sexual abuse in at least four locations, according to a December 2018 report issued by the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus. Walsh sexually abused five of his nieces hundreds of times while they were between 5 and 14 years old.
The Maryland Province moved Walsh to Woodstock from ministry in China after his nieces reported his abuse to the province in 1996. He worked there until his nieces went public with their abuse in April 1998, when he moved to Ferdinand Wheeler House, a Jesuit residence in Baltimore.
Fr. Jack Kennington worked at Woodstock from 1981 to 1983. He went on to abuse two children from 1984 to 1987 in New York City, and the church settled a lawsuit brought by the survivors in 1994.
Fr. Thomas Gannon, S.J., came to Woodstock as its director in 1983 after sexually abusing a minor at a church in Highland, Ind., that same year and abusing two adults in the 1970s while he worked as chair of the sociology department at Loyola University Chicago. He served as director of the center for three years and taught Georgetown University undergraduates as a sociology professor at the same time. 
Woodstock, which closed in 2013, is one of several spaces on Georgetown’s campus where Jesuits — including perpetrators of clerical sexual abuse — worked, lived and rest in peace. The university has maintained that the Jesuit order independently manages these spaces, but archival material and interviews with clerical abuse experts suggest close administrative links between Georgetown and spaces on campus that housed some abusers — who may have interacted with students.
Working at Woodstock
Woodstock first came to Georgetown in May 1975, when it was located in the first floor of Car Barn. Three years later, the center moved to the Georgetown Jesuit Residence in Ryan Hall.
Woodstock was moved to Ryan Hall following a need for a central location with a larger space for discussion and research, according to Fr. Robert Mitchell, S.J., the Woodstock director from 1976 to 1979. 
The Georgetown Jesuit community offered Woodstock a discount of $4,300 per year on the rent, according to “Woodstock at Georgetown: The Creation of a Library, a Center, a Community” by journalist and author Patricia Markun. The Georgetown Jesuit community constitutes Jesuits at the university, Georgetown Preparatory School and Holy Trinity Catholic Church, according to a university spokesperson.
 
The New York and Maryland Provinces financed and managed Woodstock. The center was a reincarnation of Woodstock College, a Jesuit seminary that operated from 1869 to 1974 outside Baltimore. The Maryland Province also owned and operated Georgetown until 1968, when the university became an independent institution.
Fr. Clarence L Stankiewicz, S.J., rector of the Georgetown Jesuit community from 1973 to 1979, developed the guidelines for Woodstock’s operation in 1975, following the provinces’ desire to formalize the center’s relationship with the Georgetown Jesuit community, according to “Woodstock at Georgetown.”
Woodstock has always operated independently of Georgetown, according to a university spokesperson. 
“The Woodstock Theological Center has always been an independent, Jesuit-sponsored research institute staffed, operated, and funded through the Maryland Province,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Woodstock fellows were encouraged to teach at Georgetown and other universities, however, according to a 1976 letter by Fr. Joseph Panuska, S.J., who served as a trustee for Woodstock from 1974 to 1979.
“Your relationship to the University is something which is important both to you and to the University community,” Panuska wrote in the letter to the Woodstock Community. “I can understand how some slight teaching might be both intellectually stimulating and even psychologically helpful—in addition to serving real teaching needs.”
Jesuits typically came to Woodstock in order to pursue scholarly research, according to Fr. John Langan, S.J., acting director of the Woodstock Theological Center from 1986 until 1987 and a senior fellow at the center from 1976 until 1995. 
“It is not a particularly mysterious or remote process,” Langan said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It was more like ordinary academic recruitment. That is, people came to work there because they had projects they wanted to pursue or because they had areas of expertise in areas that we were interested in working on.”
Before 2002, when the Boston Globe’s Spotlight report exposed the Catholic Church’s sexual abuse cover-up, Woodstock did not commonly track sexual misconduct allegations during the hiring process, according to Langan.
“Woodstock is a research institution, and so it doesn’t have a well-defined clientele of students or faculty,” Langan said. “There is not the kind of direct pastoral responsibility or the likelihood of situations that are focused on the discussions of the abuse of children. I think most of the time we didn’t think much about that.”
The clerical sexual abuse crisis, however, was publicly uncovered decades before 2002, when reporter Jason Berry (CAS ’71) uncovered patterns of clerical sexual abuse in New Orleans, according to Tom Doyle, a former Catholic priest and canon lawyer.
“This all exploded in the fall of 1984 in Louisiana,” Doyle said in an interview with The Hoya. “And the media, all of a sudden, changed its tune. Now they could — they weren’t afraid of the church.”
Living and Dying 
Members of Woodstock worked in Ryan Hall, but they also lived just off campus in the Woodstock Theological Residence, two blocks from Georgetown’s front gates.
Walsh, whose history of abuse was known to the Maryland Province, arrived at the second floor of Ryan Hall each day and worked alongside Georgetown students, according to Fr. Leon Hooper, S.J., current acting director of the Woodstock Theological Library, who worked with Walsh from 1996 to 1998.
“We did have some student workers there,” Hooper said in an interview with The Hoya. “You know, there was almost a little commune they had up there. The place would be open at nights, and you know the students. It was their study hall. It was their community.”
No students lived in Ryan Hall when it housed the Woodstock Center, and the center’s director conducted all hiring, according to a university spokesperson. 
Even when sexually abusive priests are reassigned to research or administrative roles without direct access to children and young adults, perpetrators can never be fully isolated, according to Doyle.
“The myth has always been: ‘We’ve got father so-and-so and he’s perpetrated a couple of times, so we’re gonna give him an assignment where he is not near young people,’” Doyle said. “The only place that you could do that is send him to Antarctica, because if you put them in a convent or a hospital, all you’ve got to do is walk outside.”
Beyond their presence on and off campus, Jesuit priests are also buried on Georgetown’s campus. 
The Jesuit cemetery on Georgetown’s campus near Harbin Hall serves as a resting place for over 320 Jesuits with ties to the Georgetown community. Among the Jesuits buried in the cemetery is longtime Georgetown administrator Fr. Martin J. Casey, S.J., who worked at Georgetown from 1973 until his death in 2006. 
Casey faced an accusation of sexual abuse of a minor from 1959, deemed plausible by the Maryland Province in a December 2018 report.
As the current superior of the Georgetown Jesuit community, Fr. Ronald Anton, S.J., handles burials in the cemetery. Before a burial can take place in the cemetery, Jesuits at Georgetown must be consulted, according to archival records and an article from the Georgetown Independent. 
“The Georgetown Jesuit Community superior and the Maryland Province determine burial decisions, which includes burying Jesuits who were a part of the Georgetown Jesuit Community,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Jesuits, including credibly accused perpetrators like Casey and Fr. Daniel O’Connell, S.J., who was stripped of his emeritus title in March 2019 in response to inquiries from The Hoya, can request where they would want to be buried upon death, a request that is usually honored, according to Fr. Brian McDermott, S.J., special assistant to University President John J. DeGioia.
“I think if you died and you’ve asked to be buried there and you served at Georgetown, especially if you die while serving at Georgetown, you go there,” McDermott said in an interview with The Hoya.

Georgetown University seniors were honored with Dean’s Medals, a Yenching Scholarship and Fulbright Awards this spring in recognition of their achievements at the university throughout the semester.
Two of the four undergraduate schools have released the names of the individuals who have earned the highest grade point averages in their class. Eileen Yee (NHS ’19), a human science major, will receive the Dean’s Medal for highest cumulative GPA. at the School of Nursing and Health Studies’ Tropaia ceremony on Friday, according to Senior Director of Communications and Strategic Initiatives Bill Cessato.
The College will have three valedictorians: Russell Wirth (COL ’19), Julie Bevilacqua (COL ’19) and Agnes Donnelly (COL ’19), according to Sue Lorenson, vice dean for undergraduate education for the College. 
The School of Foreign Service does not announce the name of the Dean’s Medal recipient until Friday’s Tropaia ceremony, and the McDonough School of Business has also not yet released the name of its valedictorian.
In addition to academic honors based on grade point average in each of the schools, both junior and senior students have received fellowships and awards throughout the semester in the form of scholarships and grants. 
Hundreds of students utilize one-on-one advising sessions each year through the Georgetown Office of Fellowships, Awards and Resources, with around 100 students receiving fellowships using the office’s support systems, according to GOFAR Senior Associate Director Lauren Tuckley. The majority of students receiving fellowships are undergraduates.
Fifty-one Georgetown students were offered Fulbright Awards to go abroad for the 2019-20 academic year, including 27 graduating seniors, but some students are still deciding whether they will accept the award, according to Tuckley. Fulbright scholars receive federal funding through grants that can be applied to study abroad after graduation, conduct individual research, pursue master’s degrees or teach English in foreign countries. 
Scholars are chosen based on an affiliation letter from the student’s university and a research project proposal alongside submitted recommendations, transcripts and a personal statement.
Mayeesha Galiba (COL ’19), one of this year’s Fulbright recipients who has chosen to accept the scholarship, will be studying in Serbia through the grant in the 2019-20 school year, she wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“I plan to learn Serbian and hopefully learn to read the Cyrillic alphabet,” Galiba wrote. “I also hope to take the time during my fellowship to shift my focus away from being a student within the structured academia of Georgetown and towards developing a sense of independence and innovation as I work within the parameters of my Fulbright.”
Gary Xie (SFS ’19) was selected as a Yenching Scholar in January following an internal nomination process through Georgetown. Xie will be among 125 individuals from 40 countries pursuing a master’s degree in China Studies at Yenching Academy of Peking University in Beijing, China, this fall through the scholarship. Xie began working on his application for the program in April 2018 and worked with the GOFAR office to create multiple drafts of his application, Xie said. 
Though he intends to major in economics and management, Xie also hopes to expand his studies into the natural sciences and rural China Studies through the fellowship while at the university, according to Xie.
“The Fellowship gives me a lot of flexibility to take almost any course Peking University has to offer. I want to expand my course selection to areas I haven’t really been taking at Georgetown,” Xie wrote in an email to the Hoya. “I think it’s the perfect program to explore China and its intellectual treasures.” 
Two students from this year’s junior class, Sinclair Blue (SFS ’20) and Mena Mohamed (SFS ’20), are recipients of the Truman Scholarship. Only 62 undergraduates were selected for the honor, which grants students $30,000 toward up to three years of graduate education leading to a public service career. 
Blue plans to pursue a dual master’s degree in public health and urban planning and hopes to work for a nonprofit that advance food justice in Washington, D.C., while Mohamed intends to earn a master’s in both international affairs and urban planning, according to the Georgetown website. Mohamed said the application process allowed her a lot of space for self-reflection to consider what the path of public service means to her.
Mohamed also looks forward to learning from other scholarship recipients in the program, she wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“I am most excited to meet the other Truman Scholars for this year and engage with what others are passionate about,” Mohamed wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is an honor to be able to share this award with so many interesting and engaged students.”

Anonymous chalk messages supporting ongoing Hong Kong protests were left in Red Square late last week, leading to a series of back-and-forth notes debating Hong Kong’s relationship with China. 
A chalk message stating: “Stop police brutality stop political arrests” appeared in Red Square Friday morning leading someone to respond below: “HK belongs to China!!!” In the ensuing week, more messages in Chinese and English joined the conversation, including “Real Chinese support Hong Kong.” Later, posters with the heading “Hong Kong is a part of China” were left in Red Square and defaced, then disappeared. 
Though many of the messages remain anonymous, one known author, Jeffrey Ngo, a Hong Kong native and second-year candidate for a doctoral degree in history, contributed to the pro-Hong Kong chalkings and graffitied the posters. Ngo is the only author who has been identified.
The messages created a discourse and engaged the Georgetown University community in the international protests, according to Ngo. 
“They might start to read about it. They might start to talk about it and I think that this would help Hong Kong in terms of generating international exposure,” Ngo said. “Obviously, again, I don’t want any injuries or anything like that but the fact that what is happening in Hong Kong and what’s happening in China, when we see that playing out at an American university it opens a dialogue.”
Months after protests broke out opposing a bill to allow criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, tensions and violence in Hong Kong have risen. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 after over 150 years of British colonial rule, and currently exists under a “one country, two systems” policy that allows the region a significant level of autonomy. 
Two of Ngo’s friends, student activist leaders Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, were arrested during demonstrations last week. Though the extradition bill was officially dropped Wednesday, the protests that began in June embody a broader call for democratization and an end to police brutality, Ngo said. 
“I think we have shaken the foundations of Beijing’s seemingly impenetrable rule over its subjects and I think, you know, it feels emotional to have left,” Ngo said. “Everybody is talking about police brutality, democratization, people want structural change in Hong Kong and that is going to be a long fight. So that fight is far from over.”
The monthslong protests have turned international attention toward Hong Kong. The global and local conversations in Red Square open a productive conversation, according to Georgetown’s Hong Kong Student Association. 
“We do welcome the attention and dialogue our city has attracted these past few months, both in Georgetown and around the world,” a representative from HKSA wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “We hope that this dialogue continues to be respectful, mature, and constructive.”
Georgetown history professor James Millward has chronicled the Red Square messages on Twitter. Millward, who specializes in Chinese history, shared pictures of the chalkings to point out the relationship between the “stop police brutality” comment and the “Hong Kong is a part of China” response. 
“My intent really was to point out that non-sequitur and to say, ‘Hey, wait a minute, listen to yourselves,’” Millward said. “I’m not unsympathetic with the concerns of [People’s Republic of China] students at all, but I think that particularly Georgetown students are capable of thinking about it in multiple ways.” 
Ngo has long been active in Hong Kong activism and spearheaded student protests in Washington, D.C., that addressed the former Hong Kong chief executive’s resignation and democratic electoral reform. The activism in Washington and on campus could have a far-reaching impact, according to Ngo. 
“This is the capital city of the U.S. This is also where think tanks are, policy makers are, reporters are and this institution produces a lot of people who will be in those positions in the near future,” Ngo said. “The additional meaning of having this play out at Georgetown is that it is going to leave a mark on American political discourse in the years to come.”
Georgetown’s Chinese Student Alliance, a cultural club, declined to comment for this story. The Chinese Students and Scholars Association, a graduate student group that previously received funds from the Chinese government, could not be reached for comment. 
The Georgetown University Student Association executive branch is preparing an official statement in support of the Hong Kong activists demonstrating for autonomy and civil liberties with peer institutions, according to GUSA Press Secretary Harper Thomas (SFS ’22). 
“As democratically elected representatives of the Georgetown University student body, and supporters of a free and democratic society, we believe GUSA has a duty to support the student unions and activists in Hong Kong in their struggle for democracy and freedom from authoritarianism,” Thomas wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The protests encapsulate diverse perspectives within the Hong Kong community, opening both an international conversation and one among Hong Kongers, according to HKSA.
“The protests happening now reflect a wide range of sentiments Hong Kongers have on their history, future, and place in the world,” HKSA wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “HKSA is open to anyone who feels connected to Hong Kong, and thus is not interested in taking an institutional stance that would risk alienating people in our community.”

The two-day Climate Forum 2020, hosted by Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, Our Daily Planet, MSNBC and New York Magazine, kicked off in Gaston Hall on Sept. 19. Thursday’s schedule for the forum included Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), currently polling second for the Democratic nomination, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who interacted with students at Yates Field House the night before the forum.
While candidates throughout the day agreed climate change is one of the most pressing issues for young voters and frequently highlighted the shortcomings of the President Donald Trump administration, their views split on topics such as nuclear energy and carbon capture technologies.
Michael Bennet 
In the first session of the climate forum, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) emphasized the need for a moderate, bipartisan solution to the climate crisis, while acknowledging the severity of the issue.
“Obviously we have a huge, unbelievably urgent existential problem on our hands, and we have lots of problems on our hands, and this generation of Americans has a lot to be really angry at us about,” Bennet stated.
In addressing the need for bipartisanship to solve the issue, Bennet touted his record in the Senate representing Colorado, a state that is evenly split down party lines, according to The Denver Post.
A shift has occurred within political parties on the issue of climate change, according to Bennet, who pointed out previous Republican support for the issue.
“The Republican Party used to have a fairly honorable environmental record,” Bennet said. “Richard Nixon created the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] and signed into law the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. Ronald Reagan closed the hole in the ozone layer. Both Bushes said, you know, we need to do something on climate, and my friend John McCain ran on climate change. What changed?”
Andrew Yang 
Many of the effects of climate change are irreversible, and our efforts to combat climate change have begun far too late, according to entrepreneur Andrew Yang, the second speaker of the day. 
Nonetheless, we must still work toward a more sustainable future, Yang said.
“I’ll stand by the fact that we are too late to curb some of the warming we’re seeing around the country and the world right now,” Yang said. “We should have been doing this work 20 years ago, but the second-best time is now.”
Many Americans think shifting toward more environmentally friendly living is too expensive and burdensome, according to Yang. However, supporting initiatives to combat climate change can actually be economically beneficial, Yang said.
“This does not have to be a matter of cost and inconvenience,” Yang said. “We can actually create hundreds of thousands of opportunities around the country if we make the move towards a sustainable economy.”
Yang said he strongly supports nuclear power as a potential green energy source and questioned why other presidential candidates would oppose the initiative.
“I don’t know why other candidates are shying away from nuclear,” Yang said. “It’s a responsibility of a leader and manager to consider every alternative, and nuclear is one of the most viable ones.” 
Marianne Williamson 
Author Marianne Williamson addressed economic injustice, intersectionality and nationwide morality, connecting the issues to climate change at each juncture during her session at the forum.
In the opening of her hour, Williamson endorsed big-picture perspectives on the issue of climate change.
“I think in many ways when we talk about climate change we talk about the trees, but we need to take a step back and talk about the forest,” Williamson said.
Williamson highlighted her “Environmental Crisis Plan,” which would create a mandatory year of service for young adults similar to the military draft, through which individuals would participate in efforts to help repair the environment. The idea was met with mixed audience reactions.
When a student voiced concerns about the safety of her policy of using hydrogen fuel in airplanes, Williamson responded that the protection of individuals should be at the forefront of climate change policy.
“I don’t buy that we’re going to have to make a choice between climate reversal and safety,” she said.
Bernie Sanders 
Citing examples of corporate influence and criticizing President Donald Trump, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) emphasized the importance of tackling climate change and standing up to the fossil fuel industry in his Climate Forum slot. 
Trump should be taking more seriously the problem of climate change much more seriously, according to Sanders.
“We are facing an unprecedented global crisis,” Sanders said. “It disturbs me very, very much that we have a president who believes that climate change is a hoax.”
Sanders has been vocal on the campaign trail about climate change as a global emergency, proposing plans to make large investments in renewable energy and create 20 million jobs.
Sanders also specifically spoke about the disproportionate effect that climate change can have on individuals from low-income socioeconomic backgrounds as opposed to affluent communities.
“We include in our proposal, many, many billions of dollars for prevention, and to do everything that we can to protect those communities, who time and time again have been hit hard by extreme disturbances,” Sanders said.
Sanders also focused on the effect certain industries have had preventing action against climate change. The fossil fuels industry has served as a major obstacle to concrete action against the issue, according to Sanders.
“We have got to stand up to the greed and corruption. I know those are strong words,” Sanders said. “The time is now to save the planet and transform the system away from fossil fuels.”
Sanders responded to criticism of some of his proposals to fight climate change by reiterating the time sensitivity of the issue.
“This is going to be administratively very, very difficult, but no one has given me an idea of what the better alternative is,” Sanders said.
John Delaney
During his time on stage, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney (LAW ’88) focused on his bipartisan record as well as his previous stances on environmental and trade issues from his tenure in Congress. 
The Keystone XL — a controversial extension of the Keystone Pipeline that runs through Canada, Montana, South Dakota and several other Midwestern states — was a mistake in the United States’ environmental record, according to Delaney.
“It was a terrible symbol we were sending to the world,” Delaney said. 
Despite his stance on the pipeline, Delaney was seen as a moderate while in Congress, ranking 36th according to the McCourt School of Public Policy’s Bipartisan Index. Delaney promised to bring bipartisanship into the climate change conversation if elected.
“The best way to pass big, transformative laws is to get bipartisan support,” Delaney said. 
Additionally, Delaney discussed the potential economic gains that he sees from the renewable energy industry as an entrepreneur, including from electric cars and carbon capture. Though Delaney says carbon capture technologies should only be used as a last resort, he mentioned the potential he sees for the technology, comparing it to renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind power.
Delaney criticized Trump’s actions, referencing the ongoing United States and China trade dispute and the president’s isolationist trade policies as a barrier to addressing climate change on a global scale. 
“You can’t tariff your way to solving climate change,” Delaney said. “You have to innovate.”
Tim Ryan 
Similar to Delaney, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) focused his conversation on industry, innovation and bipartisanship. 
Climate change should not be framed as a partisan issue, according to Ryan.
“Let’s get away from the left and right conversation and get into the newer and better conversation,” Ryan said.
Ryan focused his discussion on the manufacturing industry and the potential he sees for a green economy in the United States, particularly if the profits made from initiatives like carbon taxes are used to stimulate the economy. 
Although Trump is not to blame for every issue, Trump is at fault for not putting enough attention toward environmentally friendly industrial policy, according to Ryan.
“I don’t blame Trump for every problem,” Ryan said. “But I blame him for not having urgency and for not having a green industrial policy.”
Ryan expressed interest in using natural gas as a bridge to a long-term goal of renewable energy and working with U.S. corporations to combat the impacts of climate change. 
“Ultimately, the way you beat them is to move them off of what they’re doing,” Ryan said. “At some point, we’re working with them to get from where we are to where we need to be.” 
Julián Castro 
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro touted his record on developing sustainable infrastructure while at HUD and earlier in his career as mayor of San Antonio. 
Much of Castro’s climate platform draws on his economic and infrastructure-focused experience, and investing in sustainability will benefit the future of the American economy, he said. 
“Maybe it’s the mayor in me, maybe it’s the Texan in me, but I believe there’s a huge economic opportunity there,” Castro said. 
Though enacting strong policies with clear timelines is a key part of his plan for combating climate change, Castro also called for accountability on past missteps on climate policy, including recent appointments of policymakers at the Environmental Protection Agency who support Trump’s plan to roll back environmental regulations in favor of business freedom. 
“I’m going to appoint people to the EPA and other departments who actually believe in science and believe in climate change,” Castro said. “We need to be forward-looking with this while holding people accountable for the past.”
The historically Republican state of Texas will vote Democrat in 2020, Castro predicted, to cheers from the audience. Pro-business and environmentally friendly policies are not mutually exclusive, according to Castro. The areas of Texas that have been home to traditional sources of energy like coal and natural gas will easily transition to sustainable energy sources like wind farms and solar panel factories, Castro said.
“I do believe that [by] embracing the right kind of climate action plan that reflects the urgency of this problem, you can still win in Texas and do that,” Castro said.

The new Georgetown Capital One Café will hold its grand opening on the SE corner of M Street and Wisconsin Avenue on Saturday, Sept. 28. The cafe will serve as a space to blend banking, coffee shop and communal working space concepts.
The Georgetown location is the second Capital One Café in Washington, D.C., following the opening of one in Chinatown in 2018. The banking company purchased the space for $50.2 million, according to The Georgetowner. 
The first cafe is one of 38 located in the United States and aims to attract a younger set of customers in appealing to Georgetown students, according to Capital One spokesperson Patrica Winston. 
“The Cafés hum with community events, are frequented by local students looking for a place to study and neighborhood associations hosting networking and development events that give other members of the community the opportunity to grow and prosper,” Winston wrote.
Despite the grand opening taking place at the end of the month, the cafe has been open to the public for business since Aug. 28, and is located only six blocks from Georgetown’s campus.
The cafes intend to combine a workspace with the opportunity for financial education, according to Winston.
“Our Capital One Cafés are intentionally designed to empower people to feel more confident in their relationship with money,” she wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Part of the cafe experience is also focused on helping people stress-less through programs and information to help make their lives easier.”
The cafe has many aspects of a normal Capital One bank, including ATMs and associates prepared to help customers. Cafe locations, however, also include special additions that go beyond a traditional bank, such as a money coach, touch screen information panel and events like money workshops and all-day coffee happy hours. 
Besides operating as a fully functioning bank, the cafe serves Peet’s coffee, with baristas and a menu featuring espresso and other caffeinated drinks. Past the bar, the cafe provides study spaces on all three of its levels. 
The location now offers another spacious study spots in Georgetown, according to Colin Petzold (MSB ’20), a Georgetown student who has studied in one of the private spaces in the cafe.
“I like the fact that it has these study rooms — upstairs, downstairs, you can usually find a good place to study,” said Petzold. “There’s more space than Peet’s and Starbucks.”
At Capital One’s Chinatown cafe, customers have focused more on working and buying coffee than on banking, according to Washington Business Journal. Most patrons spent time working on their computers instead of talking to the bankers, which Capital One calls “ambassadors.”
The Georgetown Capital One Café, similar to other locations for the company, will also be a community driven through its choice of partnerships, including Baked & Wired, Bullfrog Bagels and Good Company Doughnuts, according to Winston. The location also plans to enlist local artists to provide the decorative artwork and furniture for the cafe.
Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union leadership does not expect Capital One Café to draw customers away from the on-campus bank, according to GUASFCU CEO Kuran Malhotra (MSB ’20). 
“GUASFCU is confident that its businesses will remain strong here on campus,” Malhotra wrote in an email to The Hoya “GUASFCU does remain the only full service branch on campus, and offers tailored services to Georgetown students, alumni, and their families that can only come from a not-for-profit financial institution like ours.” 
While the location may not become everyone’s new bank, the Capital One Café can act as the next hot study spot when other established places are filled, Petzfold said.
“One of these has been open every time I’ve come,” Petzold said. “I’d say in terms of coffee shops it’s probably one of the best places to study.”

During ongoing political turmoil in Hong Kong, continued public demonstrations are necessary to emphasize democratic values, activist Jeffrey Ngo said in an event Sept. 25.
The event, titled “History Before Your Eyes: Chronicling Hong Kong’s Summer of Discontent,” was part of the Asia in Depth Series hosted by the department of history. Ngo, a Hong Kong native and second year Ph.D. student in the department of history, discussed his own experience as a protester in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, introduced legislation in February that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects from Hong Kong to mainland China, which ignited large scale protests across the city as well as discourse about the topic on Georgetown’s campus. Lam has since withdrawn the bill, but protestors have issued broader demands for institutional reforms in Hong Kong, such as addressing police brutality and increasing democratic freedom. 
Hong Kong fell back under Chinese rule in 1997 after more than 150 years of British colonial rule, and currently functions under a “one country, two systems” policy that allows the region a significant level of autonomy. The extradition bill concerned Hong Kong citizens because of the Chinese government’s history of political encroachment in the region, according to Ngo. 
“Hong Kong’s autonomy being eroded by Chinese interference has been on the back of Hong Kongers’ minds for some time now, so when the extradition bill was proposed, Hong Kongers were worried,” Ngo said. 
After recognizing the ineffectiveness of peaceful protests, demonstrators turned to more drastic tactics, including throwing bricks and petrol bombs at police, Ngo said. Escalated tactics, adopted after Lam suspended the extradition bill without fully withdrawing it, have been more effective, according to Ngo. 
“For so long, the protests in Hong Kong have been known for being peaceful. Not a single piece of glass would be broken, nor would a car be burned,” Ngo said. “If you stick with peaceful protests, the government won’t listen. If you’re willing to take further steps, then that’s what is going to change the government’s mind.”
The 2019 Hong Kong protests were preceded by numerous pro-democracy demonstrations in earlier years. In 2014, a three month demonstration dubbed the “Umbrella Revolution” included thousands of civilians who clogged major roadways to protest a candidate pre-screening policy for the region’s 2017 chief executive election introduced by the Chinese government. 
Earlier this month, Ngo authored a series of back-and-forth chalk messages left in Red Square surrounding the Hong Kong protest. The messages helped bring awareness of the protests in Hong Kong to campus, according to Ngo. 
The lack of hierarchy in the organization of the Hong Kong demonstrations has also contributed to their effectiveness, Ngo said. 
“This is going to be a movement not based on hierarchies, but based on networks,” Ngo told the audience. “You can do whatever you want, and I’m not going to criticize you and vice versa because we can all pursue the same goal with different methods as long as we know what we have in mind and as long as we support each other in that way.”
On Wednesday, hours before Ngo spoke, the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees approved the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which would impose sanctions on Chinese officials accused of debasing Hong Kong autonomy. Ngo collaborated with legislators on the bill. 
The original movement has evolved into a broader petition for structural reform in Hong Kong, Ngo said. 
“The movement has moved so far beyond just one person, hence no one calling for her resignation now, and is so much more than the extradition bill, hence no one really caring whether the bill is dropped now but about structural change in Hong Kong,” according to Ngo. 
Hong Kong citizens have a responsibility to shed light on the authoritarian practices of the Chinese government due to the region’s relative autonomy, Ngo said.
“Hong Kongers must use our relative freedom to other places that are under repression of the Chinese authorities to show the world what is happening,” Ngo said.

Georgetown University students and campus sustainability organizations joined thousands of young activists protesting the effects of climate change in the Washington, D.C. iteration of the first ever Global Climate Strike last Friday, Sept. 20.  
The D.C. Global Climate Strike included protests outside the Capitol building, with protestors holding signs to bring attention to the severity of the climate crisis. Around 50 Georgetown students attended the strike on Friday, according to Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network’s Environmental Justice Team co-leader Lucy Chatfield (COL ’22). GREEN and GU Fossil Free advertised the event to the Georgetown community by collaborating to create posters for the rally prior to the event.
Mass demonstrations such as the Global Climate Strikes help show how millions of people are passionate about addressing climate change, according to Chatfield. 
“The climate crisis is so daunting, and it’s so easy to feel, as an individual, that there’s nothing you can do about it,” Chatfield wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Participating in mass mobilizations like these is how I stay optimistic, because I know there are millions of others fighting alongside me.”
Given the long-lasting impacts of climate change, attending the strike helped emphasize how much advocacy and action is needed to properly address the climate crisis, according to GUFF core member Juliette Leader (SFS ’20). (Full disclosure: Leader is a former member of The Hoya’s editorial board).
“Climate change is an issue that will be irrevocably intertwined with our lives for decades to come and will touch on every aspect of our lives,” Leader wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It was a reinvigorating experience that reminded me of how justified we are in demanding climate action now and how important our work is.”
The Global Climate Strike occurred in the midst of the Climate Forum 2020 hosted at Georgetown featuring 12 presidential candidates on Sept. 19 and 20. The two-day forum provided candidates with the opportunity to hear student concerns about the climate crisis while proposing their own climate change policies. 
Both the Climate Forum 2020 event and the Global Climate Strike brought awareness and urgency to the climate crisis, according to Citizens’ Climate Lobby President Laura Rockefeller (SFS ’22).
“The forum and the protests are both so important in making climate a visible, visceral issue,” Rockefeller wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Global Climate Strike included participants, largely students and other young people, in more than 150 countries who protested to demand more governmental action on the climate crisis. The strike on Friday was the first of many protests happening throughout this week in light of the United Nations Climate Action Summit meeting in New York City on Sept. 23. 
The D.C. Global Climate Strike included multiple youth speakers highlighting their concerns with the climate crisis. Hearing young voices talk about the negative consequences of climate change on their futures resonated with Georgetown students, according to GREEN’s Environmental Justice Team member Grace Katz (COL ’23). 
“My favorite part was when they had the speakers,” Katz said. “They had one little boy who was a part of the movement suing the government for the air quality in their city, and this 12-year-old boy spoke about how he wants to have a future and that really hit me hard.”
As a part of the series of climate change protests this week, demonstrators in the Capitol Hill area of the District blocked traffic on Sept. 24, shutting down several road intersections as a part of the “Shut Down D.C.” initiative. The event led to the police arresting 26 protesters, according to The Washington Post.
The attention that large protests like the Global Climate Strikes draw highlight the younger generation’s responsibility to bring awareness to resolving urgent climate change problems, strike attendee Trey Di Bona (SFS ’23) said.
“I hope it convinces people of the immediacy of the problem,” Di Bona said. “It’s something we’ve been putting off for half a century now, and it’s not something we can put off any longer, and I think it sends a pretty strong message that it’s our generation’s duty to fix it.”

The markers used to make those posters, the ubers and buses used to go to the protest, and the litter left behind by these marchers was egregious and shameful—it would have been more beneficial to the planet if they had stayed home the entire day.
Those signs should be written in Mandarin, Hindi, and Turkish because India, China, and Turkey are emitting increasingly compared to the United States where cities like D.C., N.Y.C, S.F. and Philly (which are population centers) are banning plastic straws (DC), Styrofoam (NYC), plastic bottles (SF) and plastic single use bags (Philly) on top of instituting congestion pricing.

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg stood by his website’s decision to staunchly promote free expression — including by permitting all political advertisements — in a packed Gaston Hall event Oct. 17. 
Zuckerberg’s speech at Georgetown University comes one month after Facebook announced the website would not regulate politicians’ speech or fact-check political advertisements ahead of the 2020 presidential election. 
Zuckerberg defended the policy in his speech, saying that even if such content is false, it is a matter of free speech to allow the advertisements and perspectives on the platform.
“Some people believe giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing us together,” Zuckerberg said in his speech. “More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes they think matter is more important than every person having a voice. I think that’s dangerous.”
Facebook was met with criticism from political and business leaders after the Sept. 24 announcement, but Zuckerberg continued to advocate for the policy in his Thursday speech. 
“I don’t think it’s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,” Zuckerberg said. “Abandoning political ads favors whoever the media chooses to cover.” 
Facebook has faced previous critiques for the company’s policy choices on content regulation in recent years. Falsehoods including unverified information about presidential candidate Hillary Clinton circulated on the website during the 2016 presidential election. Further, misinformation has since evolved to include more pervasive forms of manipulated content, such as deepfakes, on the social media platform, according to The Washington Post: A video altered to make House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) appear drunk went viral on Facebook in May 2019. 
Banning politicians’ advertisements from Facebook would also raise questions about prohibiting issue-related advertisements, creating murkier territory, Zuckerberg said at the event. 
If the website allows advertisements pertaining to specific issues such as health care, immigration or women’s empowerment, politicians should also have a voice in social media discourse, according to Zuckerberg.
“Even if we wanted to ban political ads, it’s not even clear where you draw the line,” Zuckerberg said. “I believe when it is not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of greater expression.” 
The event, titled “A Conversation on Free Expression,” was co-sponsored by the Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy and the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. Zuckerberg’s address kicked off the new GUPolitics initiative “Democracy in the Digital Age,” a series of public conversations with political, technology and media leaders on challenges and opportunities in the digital age. 
The event included a 35-minute speech by Zuckerberg, followed by a Q&A session moderated by Mo Elleithee, the founding executive director of GUPolitics. Questions were preselected from student submissions, as has occasionally been the case at past high-profile events, such as the Climate Forum 2020 and an event on free speech featuring former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Zuckerberg’s speech comes at a contentious time for the company, as Facebook is facing criticism not only for its content moderation, but also for its domination of advertising revenue in the sector. Prominent politicians, including presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), have called for the breakup of the company’s power.
Unless content has the potential to incite harm, it should remain on Facebook to effectively uphold free expression, according to Zuckerberg. 
“I believe that we have two responsibilities: to remove content when it can cause real danger as effectively as we can and to fight to uphold as wide of a definition of freedom of expression as possible and to not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary,” Zuckerberg said.
Social media has the capacity to replace the Fourth Estate of conventional news outlets as a vehicle to facilitate public discourse and inform the general population, according to Zuckerberg. 
“People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world, a fifth estate, alongside the other power structures in our society,” Zuckerberg said. “People no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers and politics in media to make their voices heard.” 
Zuckerberg also addressed Facebook’s role on the global stage, including in China; Facebook, Instagram and other services owned by the company do not operate in the country. Expanding services to China would have aligned with Facebook’s mission of creating a more inclusive and connected society, Zuckerberg said. 
However, Facebook never came to a consensus with the country on operating regulations.
“I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world, and I thought we might help create a more open society,” Zuckerberg said. “I worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in.”
Disregarding personal opinion on the divisiveness of social media, individuals must come together to champion freedom of thought, according to Zuckerberg. 
“The future depends on all of us,” Zuckerberg said. “Whether you like Facebook or not, I think we need to recognize what is at stake and come together to stand for voice and free expression.”

John Carroll Weekend, an annual alumni celebration set to take place April 16 to 19, 2020, will no longer be held in Hong Kong as a result of the city’s ongoing political unrest.
The Georgetown University Alumni Association announced its decision to move the four-day event in an Oct. 23 update on the JCW website. Though the celebration, which is open to all alumni, will no longer be held in Hong Kong, JCW is still set to take place the same weekend. The university has not yet announced the new location.
JCW typically features city tours, dozens of educational panels and social events. The weekend culminates with a banquet, celebrating the recipients of the John Carroll Award and Patrick Healy Award, which are awarded to alumni whose achievements exemplify the ideals of Georgetown and its founder, John Carroll. While JCW has been held across the United States and internationally in cities like Rome and Madrid, the event has never been hosted in Asia.
After a successful international alumni reunion in Hong Kong in 2015 and other regional Georgetown events, bringing JCW to Asia was the next step, according to Executive Director of the Alumni Association Julia Farr (CAS ’88). 
“We have been developing our relationship with our community in Asia for many years,” Farr said in an interview with The Hoya. “This is a great time where we can go and have a wider celebration.”
Joan Shang (SFS ’08), the president of the Hong Kong chapter of the Alumni Club, wrote that she was eager to share her city with fellow alumni. 
“I was quite happy for the opportunity to present my city to my fellow Hoyas from all over the world, though also quite aware of the logistical challenges of planning an event from halfway across the world,” Shang wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Hong Kong weekend was expecting 1,200 alumni from across all of Georgetown’s nine graduate and undergraduate schools. But, over the past few months, alumni began notifying the Alumni Association that they would no longer attend the event given the ongoing political protests in Hong Kong, which have continued since June, according to Farr.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam introduced legislation in February that would allow criminal suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China, igniting massive protests across the city. Lam has since withdrawn the bill, but protestors continue to call for institutional reforms in Hong Kong, such as addressing police brutality and increasing democratic freedom. 
Ultimately, the event was canceled because of the logistical challenges that the uncertain political environment posed for an event of this size, according to Farr.
“We don’t know what will be happening in April 2020,” Farr said. “With great hope that this subsides for their community, but without knowing how things were going to be one way or the other, again logistically, and knowing that very fact could be influencing our alumni not to be going — that is why we couldn’t go forward.”
First held in 1952, JCW has grown from a single regional awards dinner to a multiday international event. An event of this size takes up to two years of planning, according to Farr. The 2019 JCW in Boston included over 75 different programs for alumni to attend, including walking tours and panels led by esteemed university leaders and faculty. 
Given the ongoing protests, Shang understands the university’s decision. 
“As this is a global event we are expecting people to fly in from across the world, and while local residents are quite used to the inconveniences of the protest, it would be too much to expect international speakers and visitors to accommodate those inconveniences,” Shang wrote. 
The recent political turmoil in Hong Kong has also spurred discourse on Georgetown’s campus. In early September, anonymous writers left chalk messages supporting ongoing Hong Kong protests in Red Square, leading to a series of back-and-forth notes debating Hong Kong’s relationship with China. 
In the wake of the chalk debate, Hong Kong native and second-year doctoral student in the department of history Jeffrey Ngo advocated for continued public demonstrations at a Sept. 25 event hosted by the department of history.
The decision to relocate JCW did not come as a surprise, according to Shang, given the unrest and impact it has had on events planned in the city. 
“To be honest, all kinds of events have been cancelling left right and centre since mid July,” Shang wrote. “It has constantly been at the back of our minds that this might happen. However, there was always the faint hope that compromises might be made and things might calm down sooner rather than later, for the sake of our city, but so far this has sadly not been the case.”
JCW has taken place every year since the event’s creation in 1952. The Alumni Association plans to hold a future JCW in Hong Kong, according to the Oct. 23 online announcement regarding the weekend.
“We are grateful to the Georgetown community in Hong Kong, whose members have been enthusiastic and thoughtful partners from the moment we set our sights on the city as a John Carroll Weekend location,” the announcement read. “It remains our intention to hold John Carroll Weekend in Hong Kong in the future.”
Other alumni programming will continue to take place in Hong Kong throughout the year, Farr said. 
“We’re deeply committed to our alumni in Asia,” Farr said. “We’re going back. And when it’s the right time, we’ll plan for this again.”

As violence escalates in Hong Kong, newsrooms must make careful decisions about how they present the events of the protests, United States Bureau Chief for the South China Morning Post Robert Delaney said at a Nov. 18 event.
The event titled “Perspective of Journalism in Hong Kong” was co-hosted by SCMP and the Hong Kong Student Association. At the event, Delaney reflected on the current status of reporting about the situation in Hong Kong. 
Protests began in the region this June in response to a bill proposed by the Hong Kong government that would permit the Chinese government to extradite criminal suspects from Hong Kong. The bill, introduced in February by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, was withdrawn Sept. 4. However, protesters have continued to demonstrate since the bill’s retraction, demanding Hong Kong’s government address issues of police brutality and increase democratic freedom.
Violence surrounding the protests in Hong Kong has escalated recently, as protesters armed themselves with firebombs and bows and arrows against police in their demonstrations. 
With the most recent phase of protests exhibiting the most violence yet, newsroom debates about how to characterize protesters have been prevalent, Delaney said.
“Everyone who’s out on the street, whether they’re just walking quietly and peacefully towards Victoria Park and doing nothing more than showing up, are protesters,”  Delaney said. “At the same time you have someone showing up and throwing a molotov cocktail at a police officer and it goes up in flames. If you read the coverage and look at the way we’re characterizing these different groups of protesters, you’ll see some differences.”
In newsrooms, the ethics of whether to identify protesters is a contentious topic, according to Delaney.
“That’s a discussion that causes a lot of handwringing and heartburn in the newsroom,” Delaney said.
As unrest in Hong Kong continues, Delaney said that he cannot predict the future of the protest movement. He said he had expected the protests to settle as China and Hong Kong maintained business relations and underestimated social tensions.
“I had this assumption that was a bit insulting, I now realize, that as long as Beijing allows business to continue as usual, no one is going to get too upset in Hong Kong,” Delaney said. “Well, I was dead wrong. I didn’t understand and I didn’t anticipate the depth of feeling that is happening in Hong Kong.” 
After more than 150 years of British colonial rule, Hong Kong fell back under Chinese authority in 1997 and became a Special Administrative Region, functioning under a “one country, two systems” policy that allows the region a significant level of autonomy. The protested bill produced controversy over the functional autonomy of Hong Kong given the bill’s extradition allowances.
Not enough people understand the significance of Hong Kong’s colonial past to the current government of China and to Chinese people, according to Delaney.
“I think the depth of that concern and that sensitivity is missed on a lot of people in the U.S., and as much as we possibly can, we try to point that out,” Delaney said. “In the day-to-day reporting, it’s not really something that you can factor into every story.”
Fifteen Georgetown students studying abroad in Hong Kong this semester were told to leave their programs last week following the uptick in political unrest in the city. Within the last week, the previously isolated demonstrations reached the universities Georgetown students were enrolled in, culminating in protesters setting a university building on fire.
Delaney joined SCMP after nearly 20 years of experience working in journalism. Delaney spent 11 years as a correspondent in China for Dow Jones Newswires and Bloomberg covering economics before joining SCMP.
Although journalists have a wide range of stances on the situation in Hong Kong, journalists must still be conscious they are presenting the news accurately, Delaney said.
“I’m not going to lie; there are differences of opinions within the newsroom,” Delaney said.  “At the end of the day we have to deliver a report that is going to be as objective as possible.”

Georgetown University students and faculty deliberated over strategies and encouraged the university to attempt to accelerate the return of Victor Liu (COL ’21) and his sister, who are being prevented from leaving China, at a Nov. 17 event. 
Chinese authorities barred Liu and his sister, Cynthia Liu, from leaving China since June 2018 in an attempt to compel their estranged father, Liu Changming, to face criminal charges in Chinese court. Changming, who left China in 2007 and cut ties with his children and wife in 2012, is accused of facilitating a $1.4 billion fraud scheme during his tenure at a state-owned bank and is among one of China’s most wanted criminals. 
The siblings first traveled to China in June 2018 with their mother, Sandra Han, to visit their dying grandfather. Days after their arrival, the siblings lost contact with their mother, who was detained and sent to a secret holding facility. All three are U.S. citizens. 
The Lius’ case comes as the United States and China have engaged in a trade war, a geopolitical struggle that has made the Lius’ return increasingly difficult, according to Evan Medeiros, the Penner Family chair in Asian studies in the School of Foreign Service and a Cling Family senior fellow in U.S.-China Relations. 
“What the Chinese are focused on is negotiating this big trade deal with the Trump administration, and, as a result, the situation of Victor and Cynthia is a chit that the Chinese are trying to figure out — what kind of leverage can they elicit from the United States,” Medeiros said at the discussion.
The event, titled “Detained in China: One Year Later, What Can We Do?”, was organized by the Asian American Student Association Political Awareness Committee Co-chairs Leina Hsu (COL ’22) and Gina Kang (SFS ’22). After a brief presentation by Hsu and Kang, Victor Liu’s personal friends offered anecdotes about Liu and called on the Georgetown administration to do more to facilitate his release. 
The university should increase publicity on the issue and reevaluate Georgetown’s relationship with China, according to Noor Darwish (MSB ’21), Liu’s freshman year roommate. 
“It’s been a year, and we haven’t gotten a statement from the president’s office about Victor’s situation, and that would really generate a lot of noise in the media and hopefully spur policymakers to do something,” Darwish said at the event. “We have 10 partners in China — different universities, different organizations. It would really be a big statement if we cut off those ties.” 
The university’s global engagement office has 29 partners in China, including The Beijing Center for Chinese Studies, a Jesuit educational center offering coursework and programing, and excursions to increase the world’s understanding of China; the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, an executive state agency; and the China Construction Bank, a major bank in China. 
Two university officials offered insights into the administration’s efforts to free the siblings. The university has met with senior U.S. government officials, including President Donald Trump and contacts in China, to help Liu and his family, according to Joe Ferrara, chief of staff to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95).
“We have engaged in constant advocacy for Victor and Cynthia and their family,” Ferrara said at the discussion. “The message we’re trying to send in all of this is that we look at Victor as a member of the Georgetown community, and the most important thing we do every day is to try and protect the safety and security of the Georgetown community.” 
Ferrara has been in routine communication with Liu since June 2018, he said. 
Government officials familiar with the case, including Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have advocated for the siblings’ release with little success, according to Medeiros. 
“The U.S. has raised this multiple times at very, very high levels, and the Chinese response, to my understanding, is sort of some equivalent of, ‘How much is it worth to you?’” Medeiros said.
Liu, who would have begun his junior year this semester, studied classics and economics his freshman year and was deeply involved in Hilltop Consultants and the Georgetown University Student Investment Fund on campus. 
The Georgetown University Student Association executive called on China to immediately release the siblings and advocated for the U.S. government to work to return Victor and Cynthia Liu in a Nov. 14 statement. 
“The Georgetown University Student Association considers the wrongful detainment of Victor and Cynthia Liu an attack on our community,” the statement said. “We are committed to continue advocating for our international humanitarian rights on behalf of all of our individual members.”

Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) released a statement and contributed to legislation this week supporting the release of Cynthia Liu and Victor Liu (COL ’21) from China. 
Chinese authorities have prevented Liu and his older sister, Cynthia, who are U.S. citizens, from leaving China since June 2018 under an exit ban, which bars travelers from leaving the country. Warren and Markey, who represent the Liu siblings’ home state, released a Jan. 14 statement urging the Chinese government to release the Lius. The previous week, Cynthia penned a letter to Markey urging the U.S. government to push for their release, according to CNN.
Chinese police hope to compel the Lius’ estranged father, Liu Changming, to return to China to face criminal charges. Changming, who is accused of participating in a $1.4 billion fraud scheme, left China in 2007 and cut ties with the family. When the Liu siblings visited China with their mother, Sandra Han, to visit their dying grandfather in June 2018, authorities then imposed the exit ban blocking their return to the United States. The siblings have since lost contact with Han, who is being detained in a secret holding facility. 
The Liu siblings’ detainment is unwarranted, and their release is overdue, according to Warren.
“China’s use of exit bans on my constituents and other American citizens is unacceptable and must end,” Warren said in the shared press release. “The Liu siblings are confined to Chinese territory for no legitimate reason and it is long past time for them to come home. I’m glad to partner with Senator Markey on a bill that would hold the Chinese government accountable for this unjust policy.”
One day after issuing their statement, the Massachusetts senators collaborated with Senators Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) (LAW ’90) on a related initiative. The senators introduced a bill that would revoke or deny visas to Chinese officials involved in implementing and enforcing exit bans on U.S. citizens. China has long used exit bans to keep Chinese dissidents and human rights activists from leaving the country, according to USA Today. In recent years, however, the Chinese government has started limiting the international travel of some foreign nationals. 
After the Massachusetts senators issued their news release, Georgetown University President John DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) advocated for the release of Liu in a Jan. 14 public statement. 
“Georgetown joins Senators Markey and Warren in urgently asking for the release of Victor and his sister Cynthia, both U.S. citizens,” DeGioia wrote. “Advocacy for Victor has ensured that his case has been brought forward at the highest levels of government and, as we continue to support Victor as a member of our Georgetown community, we sincerely hope a diplomatic solution can be reached for his return home as soon as possible.”
Georgetown administrators have pushed for Victor Liu’s release for over a year, according to a university spokesperson. DeGioia met with Liu in China in Fall 2018, and Georgetown officials have held meetings with Chinese authorities about facilitating Liu’s return home. However, in recent months, the university has faced mounting pressure from students concerned with Liu’s captivity to voice more public support for his expedited return. In November, the Asian American Student Association hosted an event at which students and faculty called on the university to consider new strategies to accelerate Victor Liu’s release. 
Evan Medeiros, a School of Foriegn Service professor specializing in U.S.-China relations who has been involved in Georgetown’s efforts to push for the Liu siblings’ release, attended the event. Georgetown officials have met with members of the Trump administration and the National Security Agency to facilitate an end to Victor Liu’s detainment, according to Medeiros. 
“Georgetown is fully committed to ensuring Victor returns to the United States as soon as possible,” Medeiros wrote in an email to The Hoya. “To that end, the University has been working closely with U.S. Government officials since June of 2018 to secure Victor’s release, and we will continue to advocate for the Administration to do the utmost to secure the earliest possible return of Victor to his home in the United States.”

Georgetown University announced a temporary suspension of all Chinese study abroad programs and university-related travel to China for students, faculty and staff Jan. 28 amid rising concerns over the spread of the coronavirus in the region.
The university is in contact with students, faculty and staff who were planning on traveling to the country and is working to coordinate appropriate alternate plans, according to a Jan. 28 universitywide email from Provost Robert Groves announcing the suspension. The decision comes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of State raised their travel advisories Jan. 27 to recommend that travelers avoid nonessential travel or reconsider travel to China, according to Groves’ email.
“While there have been no reported cases with any connection to Georgetown, the university is taking proactive steps to ensure the safety and health of our community out of an abundance of caution, since there is still much about the situation that is unknown,” Groves wrote in the email. 
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China. As of Wednesday, 132 people have died and over 6,000 cases have been confirmed, with five cases confirmed in the United States, according to The New York Times. As of Monday, one person in Washington, D.C. has tested negative for the disease and two people are still undergoing testing after showing symptoms similar to those of the coronavirus, according to the D.C. Department of Health.
The coronavirus ranges in severity from mild respiratory illness to more serious symptoms including death. While experts originally linked the spread of the disease to human contact with infected animals, they now believe that the virus can be spread from person to person, according to the CDC. 
The university’s announcement comes after several study abroad programs independently announced the cancellation of their spring semester programming to their students.
The Council of International Educational Exchange announced the cancellation of all of its programs in China in an email to program participants Jan. 27. The decision was made with the best interests of program participants in mind, according to Sinclaire Jones (MSB ’21), who was set to take part in the CIEE program in Shanghai.
“Of course I’m disappointed to miss out on the opportunity to study in Shanghai, but I believe the program and the University made the right decision,” Jones wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I can only hope for the best for the country and its people and that this virus is somehow contained.”
While the exact number of students affected by the suspension is unknown, the university is actively working with students to coordinate travel plans away from the region, according to Groves’ email.
With the short notice given by the sudden cancellation, coordinating alternate plans will pose a logistical challenge to students, Jones wrote.
“They’re working to place us in alternative programs, but in the likely event that that doesn’t happen, I would have to return to Georgetown and somehow find a way to catch up considering we’re already a month into the semester,” Jones wrote.
Georgetown students who were scheduled to complete programs in Hangzhou and Kunming in collaboration with Middlebury College have the option to spend the spring semester at Middlebury’s campus in Vermont, according to William Mayers, assistant director of international programs at Middlebury.
Though this option is not ideal for some students, it is logistically easier for students since Middlebury’s spring semester does not begin until Feb. 10, according to Mayers.
“We are fully aware that this is not what they want to do, but since we can’t offer them an opportunity in China, we want to make sure that they at least have the opportunity to keep up with their studies so that they can graduate on time,” Mayers wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Replacement programs or opportunities will not provide students with the same caliber of language study, according to Philip Kafalas, associate professor and study abroad adviser for Chinese programs.
“They put a lot of work and long-range planning into getting to that point and were looking forward to both the learning and the adventure that was supposed to happen,” Kafalas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There is no substitute here for study abroad; our Chinese language curriculum is not designed to offer a full load of courses for a student at, say, a third-year level.”
As the outbreak persists, the medical and public health communities are working rapidly to learn more about the coronavirus, according to Jesse Goodman, professor of medicine and director of the Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship.
“While we wait to learn more about this virus and how it is spread, like other respiratory viruses such as flu, spread through contact with sick patients and their cough and other secretions is most likely,” Goodman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While it won’t protect against this novel coronavirus, if you haven’t yet had this year’s flu shot, it’s not too late to reduce your risk of flu, which causes similar symptoms and could be confused with coronavirus.”

Two members of the activist group Refuse Fascism were arrested for unlawful entry by the Georgetown University Police Department while demonstrating in Red Square on Jan. 27. 
Two activists, Luna Hernandez and Bo Login, entered Georgetown University’s campus alongside fellow members of Refuse Fascism, an organization that advocates for the removal of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence through nonviolent protest. Hernandez and Login were passing out flyers and speaking to students midafternoon Tuesday about the ongoing presidential impeachment trial and an upcoming related protest. 
GUPD officers asked the pair to stop distributing flyers on campus, so they decided to relocate to Red Square, which they heard was a free speech zone, to talk to students about their upcoming event without handing out flyers, according to Hernandez. 
GUPD officers arrived in Red Square and instructed the pair to leave. After the two activists refused to leave, officers handcuffed Login. He then began shouting, drawing passing students’ attention, according to video taken by The Hoya.
“Your police came and attacked us and threw us on these benches,” Login said, according to video taken by The Hoya. “We came on this university and we were having casual conversations with people about getting organized and driving out the Trump-Pence regime this Wednesday at the Capitol and your police came and arrested us.” 
After restraining and handcuffing Login, the authorities pushed and arrested Hernandez, she said. 
“They whipped me around, they knocked me to the ground, they pushed me to the ground, and I started yelling in pain, because it was painful, because he started putting his knee in my back, and another police officer came on top of me,” Hernandez said in an interview with The Hoya. “I was like, ‘You’re hurting me! You’re hurting me!’ I was trying to get up, and even when I was trying to get up they yanked me off the ground and they hurt my arm even more.”
Once Login and Hernandez were removed from Red Square, Hernadez then told GUPD officers that she could not feel her hand because the handcuffs were cutting off circulation to her hand, she said in an interview with The Hoya. The officers loosened the handcuffs and then took her and Login into custody where they were held for about three hours, according to Hernandez. 
Any member from the Georgetown community may protest as long as the speaker’s and listeners’ rights to free speech are not violated, according to a university spokesperson. Non-Georgetown affiliated visitors that have not been invited to protest, however, are not allowed to do so on Georgetown property.
“In this instance, as non-students, the protestors were informed that they could continue to protest outside of the front gates or elsewhere off-campus,” the spokesperson wrotesaid in an email to The Hoya. “When they refused, they were removed from campus by GUPD and arrested for unlawful entry.”
The GUPD crime log writes that an unauthorized protester was located in Red Square at 3:24 p.m. after they had been previously escorted off campus, with the case closing in arrest. The log separately lists that an authorized protestor was located in Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall at 3:24 p.m. after they had been previously escorted off campus, with the subjects being barred from campus.
GUPD has not responded to The Hoya’s request for comment at the time of print. 
Although the GUPD crime log says that Hernandez and Login were escorted off campus before their arrest, Raphael Kadaris, a representative from the D.C. team of Refuse Fascism, said that they were never instructed to leave before their arrest. 
“They were not protesting, they were inviting students to a protest this Wednesday at the Capitol,” Kadaris wrote in an email to The Hoya. “They were never actually told they had to leave before they were arrested. They had been told they couldn’t pass out flyers, which they stopped doing.”
The incident was unsettling to watch, according to Leo Rassieur (COL ’23), a Georgetown University Student Association Senator who witnessed the event. 
“I saw a police officer grab her wrist, then she yelled and was pushed to the ground. She was recording the arrest of the other protestor,” Rassieur wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
People and groups not affiliated with the university are barred from flyering on campus, according to the university’s Speech and Expression Policy. Only members of the academic community are allowed to hang posters or hand out handbills or pamphlets, the policy reads.  
Open discourse is authorized in specific locations on campus, including Red Square, according to the policy. The policy does not specify if people outside the Georgetown community are welcome in those spaced without an invitation those spaces. 
“Certain areas of campus shall be considered ‘public squares’ and shall be available, without prior arrangement, for individuals and groups during daylight hours for the purpose of exchanging ideas,” the policy reads. 
Login and Hernandez were arrested despite complying with university policy, according to a Refuse Fascism twitter thread chronicling the events of Jan. 27. 
“@Georgetown’s core mission states it is a ‘university with a heart’ dedicated to ‘social justice’ and ‘restless inquiry,’” the tweet said. “Yet they brutally arrested activists engaged in nonviolent speech, simply inviting students to protest a white supremacist, fascist regime?”
Despite the previous day’s events, members of Refuse Fascism, including Hernandez and Login, returned to campus Jan. 28. Hernandez said Georgetown should apologize to her and Login and provide the pair a chance to speak about their experience. 
“I think the university should give us an apology,” Hernandez said. “That was unacceptable, that they violently arrested us, I think that there should be students and professors inviting us to their classes to talk about what actually happened.”

Welcome to the real world little boy and little girl. This country is in the best shape it has been in for a long time. The stock market is setting daily records, unemployment is the lowest it has been in decades and China is not taking advantage of this country trade wise anymore and is getting a taste of there own medicine. Yes the President calls people names ,has a potty mouth and wants people entering this great country to be documented so they can be found if they commit a crime instead of just running back to there third world country  nameless and w/o justice. Get over it and GROW UP.

The campus needs to be a place where students, faculty, and employees all feel safe.  If they have not been invited, someone cannot just decide they want to be on campus for whatever reason.  We all remember the University of Virginia protestors who also were not students and not invited.  And the fact that these intruders had been asked multiple times simply to relocate outside the gates made them even more unpredictable and possibly threatening. Add on top of that, after their arrest, they returned the following day claiming to be asking for an apology — this simply sounds like stalking. Dude, GU is just not into you. You just come on too strong and don’t follow the rules.  I am sure you have good intentions but this relationship is not going to work out. Don’t make it awkward or embarrassing for either side. GU just has other people with whom they want to partner on these very same issues. I know you think if GU could only get to know you, then they would definitely want to be at least friends (maybe more?) — but you don’t respect boundaries. And no means no. So as a parent of a student, I appreciate that GU Police responded to the situation appropriately.

The Georgetown Collaborative Diplomacy Initiative hosted its first Chinese New Year Celebration to promote cultural diplomacy between American and Asian Cultures on Jan. 24. 
GCDI, a graduate student organization funded by the School of Foreign Service, seeks to educate Georgetown University students about the factors influencing diplomacy, facilitate experiences with practitioners and seek new solutions to diplomatic problems. The event was celebrated a day before the 2020 Chinese New Year, also called Lunar New Year, an observance of the start of the new year in a lunar calendar. 
The event, which took place in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room, sold out with over 130 guests in attendance, according to second-year Masters student in the School of Nursing and Health Studies and President of GCDI Heerak Kim. GCDI and co-sponsors organized the event to promote intercultural engagement by embracing Chinese and other global cultures, according to Kim.
“The purpose of Chinese New Year Celebration is to practice cultural diplomacy by wanting people who are not Chinese to come and meet Chinese individuals who are students at Georgetown so that we have cultural exchange and creation of mutual understanding, which is the bedrock of cultural diplomacy,” Kim said.
The UCLA Network of Washington, D.C. and the University of California, Berkeley, Association of Washington, D.C.. were co-sponsors of the event. Both organizations offer opportunities and resources within the private sector, academia, civil society and cultural and religious institutions alongside traditional diplomatic organizations in D.C. for alumni and current students.
The event gave attendees the opportunity to learn about Chinese students’ experiences celebrating Chinese New Year in China, according to Greg Cooper, an attendee who heard about the event from the UCLA Alumni Association. 
“People were really friendly, the food was really good, and I heard some great singing,” Cooper said in an interview with The Hoya. “I learned, at my table there were a couple of students from China, so I learned about their traditions, and how they would celebrate with their family back in their hometown.”
The event featured performances by two Georgetown acapella groups, Georgetown Superfood and the Georgetown GraceNotes, as well as a blessing from Fr. Christian Wagner, S.J., a member of the Georgetown Jesuit community who has done mission work in Taiwan and mainland China, and a speech from Maryland’s 2nd District Republican Candidate Genevieve Morris.
The performances at the event by Superfood and the GraceNotes show how Chinese New Year is a celebration that can be appreciated by all, not just those with Chinese heritage, according to Kim.
“We brought Superfood and GraceNotes because cultural exchange goes both ways,” Kim said. “Having the two music groups allows the opportunity for global celebration of Chinese New Year as something that is not confined to the Chinese people, or Asian people, but that it is an international celebration, and an important one.”
The GraceNotes’ performance of “Gong Xi, Gong Xi,” a popular Chinese New Year song, was especially impressive, according to second-year Masters student in the learning, design, and technology program Sandy Lee.
“I was not expecting them to sing in Chinese, but that was unique, and in my experience I don’t know of any other schools that have the acapella groups singing in a different language so that was impressive,” Lee said in an interview with The Hoya.
The event comes days after the Georgetown University Student Association unanimously passed a resolution calling on the university to recognize the Lunar New Year on the official Georgetown University calendar and their social media platforms at a Jan. 20 meeting.
The celebration represented an important step for the Georgetown community toward intercultural appreciation and understanding.
“I think that this celebration is great, we have over 130 people attending today to celebrate Chinese New Year,” Kim said. “I think this is a monumentally important event for Georgetown University in terms of cultural understanding, cultural diplomacy, and/or encouraging understanding of Chinese culture, Chinese history and Chinese people.”

Georgetown University and many of its study abroad partner programs in China have worked to coordinate new spring semester plans for students affected by program cancellations after rising concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
The university suspended all Chinese study abroad programs and university-related travel to China on Jan. 28 after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of State raised their travel advisories Jan. 27 to recommend travelers avoid nonessential travel and reconsider travel to China. Seven Georgetown students were affected by the program cancellations, according to study abroad adviser for Chinese programs Philip Kafalas.
After the sudden and unexpected cancellation of study abroad programs, Georgetown hopes to support students through this transition period, according to a university spokesperson.
“The university is working with all students affected by this travel moratorium individually to coordinate appropriate alternate plans and ensure academic continuity,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The university has been helpful in its efforts to reintegrate students who wish to return to Georgetown for the remainder of the spring semester, according to Andrew Kaplan (SFS ’21), who had originally planned on studying at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing through The Beijing Center program.
“Georgetown has actually been fantastic about the transition, and I was a little bit surprised because I knew that they didn’t have a specific policy already in place and that this was a pretty unusual situation,” Kaplan said. “Once I got back to the U.S., I flew straight to D.C. and I met with my dean, I think it was the next day, and I started picking out classes with him. He was able to email each of the professors for the courses I was interested in taking and all of them individually approved me to join their class three to four weeks late.”
Many of Georgetown’s study abroad partner programs in China have also been working closely with students, prioritizing their safety and well-being, according to Associate Director of Marketing for TBC John Sember.
“The Beijing Center helped to facilitate students’ departure from China, made transportation arrangements from campus to the airport, provided masks, water and snacks, shared information and updates on the illness, and encouraged students to take a 14-day self-quarantine upon returning home,” Sember wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The swift decision to cancel was necessary in order to safely get all the students back home before the coronavirus infections spiked in numbers.”
Programs such as TBC and the Council of International Educational Exchange have been providing students with alternate options for the remainder of their spring semester, according to Sember.
“Many partner universities of The Beijing Center have been working closely with students to provide them with some options in this unique, emergency situation,” Sember wrote. “For example, joining another exchange program, enrolling late into courses at their home university and catching up on missed work, or taking this spring semester off and resuming studies next semester.”
The option to attend other programs ensures academic continuity for students, according to Chloe Tan (MSB ’21). Tan, who was originally enrolled in the CIEE Shanghai program, will now be attending a CIEE program in London.
“Overall, my alternative program will be the same dates and under the same itinerary as the original Shanghai program, so luckily there’s not too many changes to my semester schedule,” Tan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I do not have any significant changes to my class schedule and I’ll be able to graduate on time.”
Despite the suspension of Chinese study abroad programs for the semester, programs for future semesters remain unaffected for now as research into the coronavirus epidemic continues, according to Sember.
“TBC is very sorry that this unexpected event has impacted the spring 2020 program and we hope to welcome the students again in the future once the coronavirus is resolved,” Sember wrote. “We still plan to run our summer and fall 2020 programs, but we will continue to monitor the coronavirus situation closely.”

The U.S. and Australian governments must reassess and adjust their alliance to accommodate changes in the global political sphere, Australian National University senior lecturer Andrew Carr said at an event Thursday. 
As the U.S. and Australian alliance approaches its 70th anniversary in 2021, Carr explained that the two nations must reassess their strategic interests and acknowledge their differences. Although an alliance between the U.S. and Australia remains popular, it may become invisible if politicians do not account for the countries’ diverging policies, Carr said at the Feb. 6 event titled “The Ally’s Burden — What does Australia owe America in 2020 and beyond?”
The alliance was signed in 1951 with a mutual understanding that Australia would offer the U.S. trade, public political support and private intelligence sharing. In return, the U.S. would provide security to protect the Australian continent, Carr said. The terms of the current alliance, however, are outdated in today’s international political climate. 
“America needs more than just a small but loyal friend. As Australia faces its own economic decline, its political weight and economic influence is waning,” Carr said. “Australia cannot just rely on an unspoken promise of security anymore. The alarm bells are ringing, and we need to think about not just worst-case scenarios but a handful of quite plausible conflicts in our near neighborhood.” 
The United States and Australia have evolved politically since the the start of their alliance, leading to diverging strategic interests around the world, according to Carr. In 2020, the two countries have varying policies and perspectives around U.S. power in Asia, infrastructure developments in China, defending Taiwan and the role of Australian troops around the globe, Carr said. 
Many politicians and journalists have falsely argued that the nations’ diverging interests have been caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s diplomatic approach or Chinese interference in Australia, according to Carr. 
“These differences are due to underlying strategic differences and strategic interests and not due, as sometimes claimed, to the bombastic style of President Trump, nor as evidence of Chinese coercion, bribery and other influence campaigns by the CCP,” Carr said. 
A 2019 poll showed that 72% of Australian citizens consider their country’s alliance with the U.S. very important or fairly important for Australian security, according to the Lowy Institute, which conducts an annual poll of Australian attitudes toward the United States. For the alliance to remain viable in the future, however, the nations must consider a new arrangement, according to Carr. 
“If we are to remain mates, a new approach to our relationship is going to have to face up to what I see as a diverging series of strategic interests,” Carr said. “It will have to take a form that meets these challenges and differences and offers greater value to both parties.”
Carr works in the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at Australian National University. He is an expert in strategy, time, middle powers and Australian defense policy and has published books with Oxford University Press and Georgetown University Press, as well as numerous academic journal articles on the subject. Carr spoke at the discussion, hosted by the Walsh School of Foreign Service in the McGhee Library in the Intercultural Center on Feb. 6. 
At the event, Carr said political actors from the United States and Australia must reconsider their shared strategic missions and the value of their continued alliance so that the nations can productively pursue their goals. 
“At times of uncertainty such as this moment, I believe that questions of presence must give way to deeper questions of purpose,” Carr said. “Only if we have clear ideas about what both of our nations seek and how we want to achieve those goals can the questions of material cooperation and material allocation make sense.” 
Although the United States has aided Australia militarily and politically in many instances throughout the nation’s history, Australia needs to reprioritize its own strategic interests, according to Carr. 
“What does Australia owe the United States in 2020? The answer remains a great deal,” Carr said. “I do not expect America acts purely in self-sacrifice, and I do not believe we can be asked to do so likewise. Our mateship, if it is to endure, needs to be based on a firm understanding of our underlying strategic interests. As these are evolving, so must the nature of our relationship.”

Study abroad programs in Australia and Ireland for students in Georgetown University’s Nursing & Health Studies Department of Professional Nursing Practice were put on indefinite hold for the fall 2020 semester, marking the third wave of study abroad complications in four months.
University officials decided to cancel the Australian Catholic University School of Nursing, Midwifery and Paramedicine program after curriculum changes at the host university were deemed no longer compatible with the NHS curriculum, according to an email obtained by The Hoya. Study abroad programs must meet specific guidelines of course material, fieldwork and observation, to be approved by the Office of Global Education.
The University College Dublin College of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems program in Ireland was also canceled after increasing domestic applications prevented international students from participating in the program. 
Scheduling changes in the Australian program would leave nursing students unprepared for future coursework, according to Kelley Miller Wilson, the bachelor of science in nursing program director.
“The Australia Nursing Study Abroad program was also put on hold due to curriculum and clinical placement changes that would no longer give NHS nursing students the necessary curricula and clinical experience to allow them to continue their studies without additional coursework upon their return to the Georgetown Main campus,” Wilson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The program curriculum for Georgetown nursing students was especially designed in collaboration with ACU’s School of Nursing, Midwifery and Paramedicine and included opportunities for students to participate in fieldwork, a key component of nursing requirements.
Geraldine Sackey (NHS ’22), who had hoped to study abroad at ACU in fall 2020, said she was disappointed to learn the program would not run, after meeting the Jan. 17 application deadline for NHS students.
“We had to do so much just to apply, and we finally got the program and told our families, and then it just got canceled,” Sackey said in an interview with The Hoya, “This program aligned with my goals. I told my family members and then they just canceled it.”
Since September, an unprecedented fire season in Australia has killed at least 33 people and destroyed 3,000 homes, according to The New York Times. The fires present no imminent danger to ACU students. The fires did, however, also prompt concern for Georgetown administrators, according to the email sent to nursing students. 
For the nursing programs in Ireland, increased domestic demand prompted UCD to refuse all foreign applicants to their nursing programs for the first time, according to Wilson.
“Administrators learned that UCD in Dublin is no longer able to provide any clinical placements for foreign nursing students due to the increasing demands of their homeland students,” Wilson wrote. “While this has not been the case in the past, it has effects on the fall 2020 program.”
The program holds come after Georgetown canceled programs in Hong Kong and China in the last three months. In January, the university announced the cancellation of all study abroad programs in China because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus after national advisories. In November 2019, the university also suspended study abroad programs in Hong Kong after widespread protests in the city.
Students in the Chinese programs are working with the university to formulate alternative plans for the current spring semester after news of the cancellations. 
The university also plans to provide alternatives for the fall semester for the NHS students affected by the latest cancellations, according to a university spokesperson.
“The NHS, in collaboration with the Office of Global Education, will continue to explore possible alternatives to allow NHS nursing students to study abroad during their time at Georgetown,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The alternative plans organized by the university, however, are not sufficient for nursing students who require specially scheduled clinical experience, Rhiannon Leonardo (NHS ’22), an applicant to the ACU program, said in an interview with The Hoya.
“Those are for non-nursing and that just doesn’t work with the nursing schedule because we have to be in clinical classes, so any other program that the university offers just wouldn’t work for us,” Leonardo said.

The Office of the Provost recognized five members of Georgetown University’s faculty as distinguished associate professors in a Feb. 5 announcement by Provost Robert Groves on his blog.
Three of the recipients, history professor Kathryn de Luna, psychology professor Adam Green and chemistry professor Kaveh Jorabchi, are faculty members in the College. Finance professor Alberto Rossi in the McDonough School of Business and professor of energy and environment and Director of the Science, Technology and International Affairs Program at the School of Foreign Service Joanna Lewis also received the distinction.
Recipients of the provost’s distinguished associate professor award for accomplishments in education, created in 2016, are first nominated by department chairs and unit heads before being reviewed by a committee of senior faculty. The committee then forwards selections to the provost for approval, according to the Office of the Provost’s official web portal.
The award recognizes the achievements in research and teaching by Georgetown faculty members across the different schools, according to Vice Provost Reena Aggarwal, who serves as the chair of the review committee for the award.
“The Committee recognizes faculty who are at the frontier of pushing knowledge in their fields,” Aggarwal wrote in an email to The Hoya. “They are not only doing amazing scholarship, they are also excellent teachers, offering cutting edge courses and/or mentoring students. We want to recognize and reward ‘rising stars’ who perform at an extraordinary level, and are contributing to Georgetown, their profession, and the broader community.”
The strong sense of community present at Georgetown creates an environment conducive to the kind of research and academic work that the award recognizes, according to winner Jorabchi.
“The supportive environment at GU has been an important factor in the development of my work,” Jorabchi wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I connect with the student-centered philosophy of GU and am inspired by the community spirit of the university.”
Jorabchi, whose lab regularly works with undergraduate and high school students in addition to graduate students, focuses on improving methods of detecting and quantifying chemically complex samples of trace substances through his research. In the last few years, he has received grants totaling $1.5 million from organizations including the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.
While the award itself is only granted to certain associate professors, it serves as a recognition of the cooperative work and research conducted by all members of the Georgetown academic community, according to de Luna.
“This award appears to honor a few individuals but it is actually a recognition of our wider intellectual networks; faculty are constantly learning from colleagues, from collaborators and co-authors, from graduate students and undergraduate students,” de Luna wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
De Luna, who specializes in the histories of eastern, central and southern Africa before the 20th century, has conducted fieldwork among fifteen societies in five countries in eastern and south-central Africa. Her 2017 book “Collecting Food, Cultivating People: Subsistence and Society in Central Africa” received the Henry A. Wallace Award from the Agricultural History Society in 2017 and the CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title award in 2018.
The third winner from the College, Green, a cognitive neuroscientist whose work is helping to form a new discipline known as the Neuroscience of Creativity, is seeking to combine behavioral, neural and genetic analyses to better understand how the brain learns and makes connections between ideas and events.
The award is indicative of the great support Georgetown offers for research and academic pursuits across all fields, according to Green.
“We get to chase knowledge, ask these big questions that we’ve been wanting to ask since we were five years old and that we’re supported in that sort of search for knowledge without kind of the direct forcibility of a more applied form of materials, research or something like that or something that you would have in the industry if you were doing research,” Green said in an interview with The Hoya.
Rossi, the winning professor from the MSB, serves as an associate editor for the Journal of Financial Econometrics, the Journal of Empirical Finance and the International Journal of Financial Engineering. Rossi is currently researching machine learning, financial technology, empirical asset pricing and household finance and has been a keynote speaker at finance conferences around the world, according to his website. 
Lewis, the fifth winner, has worked on energy and climate issues in China for about 20 years and has consulted for foundations and governmental, nongovernmental and international organizations on similar projects, according to her university biography. She also heads Georgetown’s U.S.-China Climate Research Dialogue and the U.S.-China Energy and Climate Working Group, among other projects. Her 2014 book “Green Innovation in China” won the 2014 Harold and Margaret Sprout Award from the International Studies Association.
The recognition granted by this award, as well as the continued support of the Georgetown community, will enable recipients to further develop their research and connections, according to Jorabchi.
“Scientific discussions with students and popping into the lab to participate in experiments are the most joyful parts of my day. Discussions with my colleagues in the Chemistry department have also influenced my teaching and research,” Jorabchi wrote. “I hope to further grow this integrated network of people and activities that influence all aspects of professional life at GU.”

Georgetown University temporarily suspended all study abroad programs at the Villa Le Balze in Florence, Italy, after the university announced a suspension of all university-related travel to South Korea on Tuesday over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention raised the advisory levels for Japan and Italy to Level 2 on Feb. 22 and Feb. 23, recommending travelers practice enhanced precautions when traveling to these countries. University programs in Japan, however, have not been suspended. The CDC also elevated the advisory level for South Korea to Level 3 on Feb. 24, advising travelers to avoid all nonessential travel to the country. 
The decision to cancel study abroad programs depends on the local conditions and development of the coronavirus, also called COVID-19, which Georgetown continues to monitor, according to a university spokesperson.
“The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak raises a number of considerations both in terms of health and safety, and also practical operational considerations with respect to the ability to most successfully support students abroad,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Because local conditions, support from on-ground partners, and travel restrictions vary by country, and by program, the university reviews these decisions on a program-by-program basis, after careful consideration of all relevant factors.”
The university is currently working individually with students in affected programs to coordinate travel efforts and create alternative plans as necessary, according to the university spokesperson.
Professors will implement instructional continuity plans for students in programs at the Villa Le Balze beginning March 9, according to the university spokesperson. Under the plans, students will still complete the required coursework from their semesters after being relocated from Italy. 
Currently, the university has only announced the cancellation of the spring semester at the Villa Le Balze, a Georgetown-owned academic campus. Planned courses over the summer are currently still set to take place, according to journalism professor Ann Oldenburg (GRD ’20).
“I’m set to teach a new class, International Journalism: Reporting from Florence, this summer at the villa,” Oldenburg wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As of now, it’s still on, and I hope the students who have signed up will still want to join me there.”
Despite the Villa Le Balze cancellation, other study abroad programs in Italy have not been canceled yet, including all programs through the Institute for the International Education of Students, Brown University, Middlebury College and Duke University.
While the cancellation is unfortunate, it is a necessary step by the university to ensure the safety of students, according to Oldenburg.
“I was sad to hear that the Villa had to be shut down for this semester, but it seems a prudent move by the university,” Oldenburg wrote. “I just hope a cure will be found quickly and the spreading of the virus will soon be stopped.”
The suspension of the programs comes after the university canceled all study abroad programs in China on Jan. 28 during the initial outbreak of the coronavirus. Before the university announcement, several programs independently made the decision to cancel their programs over fear of the spread of the disease. A university-sponsored trip to Cambodia will also be postponed until after the spring semester. 
More than 80,000 people in 48 countries and territories have been infected with the coronavirus since the initial outbreak, and nearly 3,000 have died, according to CNN. Of the reported cases, over 78,000 have been from China, with around 2,700 deaths in the country. 
South Korea has reported more than 2,000 cases of the virus, the largest outbreak outside of China, according to CBS News.
The university is working with students, faculty and administrators in South Korea programs to coordinate travel home,  according to a Feb. 25 universitywide email from Provost Robert Groves announcing the suspension. Given the developing situation regarding the outbreak of the virus, the university will continue to assess university programs as news breaks, Groves wrote in the email.
“The uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus have made travel to countries with extensive interactions with locations severely affected by COVID-19 more risky,” Groves wrote. “While Georgetown has not prohibited university-sponsored or related international travel to any country other than China and South Korea due to COVID-19, the situation continues to be very fluid.”

Former Georgetown University student and South Korean pop artist Kim Sang-woo (COL ’19), popularly known as Roy Kim, has been cleared of charges of circulating obscene materials.
Kim had been a suspected member of one of singer Jung Joon-Young’s mobile chat rooms, in which group members shared sexually explicit photographs of women. Kim was formally charged by the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency in April 2019 for violating Korean information and telecommunications law. After an investigation, the indictment against Kim was officially suspended Feb. 25, according to K-pop news agency Soompi.
The charges against Kim came amid a national scandal that implicated multiple prominent K-pop stars for their involvement in group chatrooms where they shared explicit videos of women and discussed raping and drugging women. Jung and former member of rock band FT Island Choi Jong-hoon were both convicted of gang rape in relation to the Jung chatroom scandal in November 2019, according to the South China Morning Post. Jung was also separately charged with filming and distributing footage of other assaults.
On Feb. 25, a reporter on a South Korean entertainment news show said that Kim was only a member of a chat room that specifically focused on the sport of fishing, according to Soompi.
In the fishing chatroom, Kim attempted to clarify to members of the group chat that a certain pornographic image was photoshopped, according to the reporter.
“There was an instance of a photoshopped pornographic image of a celebrity being shared in the chatroom. Roy Kim took a screenshot of a blog image and posted it saying, ‘This is not that person,’ and that is what he was charged for,” the reporter said on the news show, according to Soompi. “So Roy Kim had posted the photo, not for others to see, but to state that it was a photoshopped image, and that is what got him charged for spreading pornographic material.”
On the same day, Kim released a statement to his fans affirming the reporter’s narrative and expressing regret for his mistakes.
“I found the picture addressed in the stories on a blog post by looking it up on a portal site, screenshot it and sent it along with a text saying that the rumour wasn’t true into a chatroom,” Kim wrote in his statement. “I realised that regardless of my motive, it was wrong to send such a photo and I am reflecting on my mistake. I’m really sorry for hurting those who love me despite my reckless actions.”
Kim rose to fame on a South Korean music competition show called “Superstar K” in 2012 and reached the top of the K-Pop Hot 100 Chart with his debut single in 2013. While the investigation was pending, Kim went on an indefinite career hiatus and returned to South Korea a month before he was set to graduate from Georgetown. 
A Georgetown student circulated a Change.org petition in April 2019 calling for Kim to be suspended from the university and later expelled if he was convicted. The petition reached 4,726 signatures.
Kim missed the final month of school and was unable to attend his graduation ceremony. No disciplinary action was taken by the university at the time and Kim received his diploma, according to SPOTV News, a South Korean broadcast.
A university spokesperson confirmed that Kim graduated in 2019, but provided no further comment.
“We can confirm directory information and share that Roy Kim graduated in 2019,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Otherwise, Georgetown refrains from commenting on individual students in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).”
Kim appreciates his fans’ support throughout the investigation process and hopes to resume his career now that the charges have been dropped, according to the letter Kim wrote to his fans.
“I was able to look back at my past and realised how precious the love I received was even though I was lacking in many ways. I am thankful to the point where I can’t express it in words,” Kim wrote. “I will not disappoint those who have believed and waited for me. I will return as the Roy Kim who everyone loved and supported. I will be mindful from here on out.”

Georgetown University’s Office of Global Education postponed a Centennial Lab’s spring break trip to Cambodia until after the end of the spring semester, due to increasing concerns over the spread of the coronavirus in Asia. 
Students enrolled in “Politics and Performance: Confronting the Past, Shaping the Future,” the affected Centennial Lab, which is a program of courses that focuses on experiential learning, planned to travel to Cambodia over spring break. Following reports that one passenger tested positive for the coronavirus after going on a cruise that disembarked in Cambodia, the OGE decided Feb. 18 to postpone the travel component of the class. 
While Cambodia has reported only one registered case of coronavirus, health officials are now worried Cambodia may have opened its doors to an outbreak, according to The New York Times. The spread of coronavirus has led the university to cancel study abroad programs in China in January and South Korea this week. 
As the coronavirus, also called COVID-19, outbreak spreads, the university is evaluating the health risks of study abroad programs individually, according to Vice Dean for Undergraduate Affairs of the School of Foreign Service Daniel Byman.
“The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak raises a number of considerations both in terms of health and safety, and also practical operational considerations with respect to the ability to most successfully support students abroad,” Byman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Because local conditions, support from on-ground partners, and travel restrictions vary by country, and by program, the university reviews these decisions on a program-by-program basis, after careful consideration of all relevant factors.”
Cambodian Living Arts, which was set to host students in the Centennial Lab, is prepared to receive the class in May. The organization promotes creativity and innovation in the arts sector and works to get more arts and culture education into Cambodian public schools, according to the Cambodian Living Arts website. 
The university is watching developments in Cambodia and will decide whether or not to run the trip in May depending on coronavirus conditions, according to Byman.
Professors Derek Goldman and Cynthia Schneider, who are co-teaching the course for the third time this year, remain hopeful the trip will run with its original itinerary and all students will still participate. 
“Needless to say we are heartbroken about the situation, as sharing this trip with our students has been profoundly meaningful to us, and we are very hopeful that the trip will be able to happen in May with as many of the students as possible,” Goldman wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Cambodia is the ideal case study for the Politics and Performance Centennial Lab, which aims to study the important intersection of politics and performance through diverse examples from the past and present, because it is an example of a place where the arts play a vital role in a post-conflict context, according to the course syllabus. 
Goldman and Schnieder are working to adapt the course material to account for changes caused by the trip postponement, according to Schneider.
“It’s much better to have it in the middle of the semester, much better, but we can still lead up to it during the course, and the students can still have a really fulfilling, meaningful, culminating experience,” Schneider said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think we’re all trying to make the very best out of a really regrettable situation.” 
The 14 students enrolled in the course now must make alternative arrangements for spring break. Such last minute changes may pose a financial burden to students, according to Celia Buckman (SFS ’21), one of the students enrolled in the Centennial Lab.
“It’s really annoying that this came at such short notice.” Buckman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’ve had to replan my spring break overnight, which comes at a financial cost since everything is more expensive with such a tight turnaround.”
The university is coordinating with students affected by the Centennial Lab change in an effort to mitigate the effects of the postponement, according to Byman.
“SFS administrators are working closely with concerned professors and students,” Byman wrote. “The professors engaged us from the start regarding travel safety and are an important part of every decision we make. We are working with students, both as a group and as individuals, to make sure that no one faces problems regarding graduation credits or other possible academic issues.”

Global leaders must prioritize protecting religious minorities against persecution and violence, Prince Zeid bin Ra’ad al-Hussein of Jordan said at a Thursday event.
Zeid served as United Nations high commissioner for human rights from 2014 to 2018, during which he condemned extremism in the Middle East, South America and Eastern Europe. He also assisted in the 2002 founding of the International Criminal Court, an intergovernmental judicial body that prosecutes global crimes against humanity. Zeid discussed the threats to coexisting belief systems at the March 5 event in Copley Formal Lounge.  
Religious pluralism reveals the common humanity in all people that fanatical, violent organizations often obscure, according to Zeid. 
“We as humans are much more complex,” Zeid said. “We are also better human beings than the extremists on both sides would have us believe.” 
Attacks on worshippers and their religious spaces have pervaded the international religious landscape in recent years, according to Zeid. As the world faces ongoing attacks on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, violence against Uyghur Muslims in China, the publicly streamed mosque shooting in New Zealand, attacks on synagogues in the United States and church bombings in Egypt and Burkina Faso, the violence has desensitized society’s reaction, according to Zeid.
“The recent ongoing violence against believers or those of a different belief has been not short of numbing,” Zeid said.
Heads of state are typically responsible for leading the charge of violence against religious minorities, according to Zeid. They often instruct their citizens to target minority groups through lies and dog whistles, he said. 
“Pick a target, and through a combination of half truths and insinuation, attack them, but indirectly, while allowing or quietly prompting your followers to do so directly, all the time denying you have anything to do with the violence when it results,” Zeid said. “The xenophobia, racism and religious intolerance does not also come out of nowhere; it feeds off of a less apparent structure of the state, discriminations and prejudices that already exist in practically all societies, and are amplified by the use of hypotheticals.”
Zeid was joined by panelists Asma Afsaruddin, a professor of near Eastern languages and culture at Indiana University Bloomington, John Borelli, the special assistant for Catholic identity and dialogue to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) and Thomas Michel, vice president for academic affairs at the Xavier Learning Community in Chiang Rai, Thailand. The event, titled “The Challenge of Pluralism in the 21st Century,” was hosted by the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. 
Cooperation among people of different faiths combats ignorance regarding religious pluralism, according to Borelli. 
“Ignorance, yes, is one of the items, one of the challenges that we face regarding religious pluralism,” Borelli said. “Some of that ignorance is addressed through education, and a lot of the ignorance can be overcome through action and acting together.” 
Zeid served as the Jordanian ambassador to the U.N. and the United States before he was appointed U.N. high commissioner for human rights. During his tenure, he was noted for condemning xenophobic rhetoric, ranging from that of the Islamic State to that of world leaders like U.S. President Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, the president of the French National Rally Party. 
Working at the U.N. revealed the dysfunction among global forces when enforcing peace and security internationally, according to Zeid. 
“For many years, I had an orchestra seat in the playhouse of international relations, the U.N. Headquarters in New York, watching at times with utter bewilderment for the cowardice, double standards and hypocrisy of states,” Zeid said. “I therefore have no illusions of what we are, or what harm we are capable of.”

This article was updated at 8:25 p.m. EST on November 17 to reflect the latest developments. 
After claiming its first life in Wuhan, China, in mid-January, COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus strain, has infected millions and killed hundreds of thousands worldwide. Governments, businesses, and schools have undertaken efforts to contain the disease and are struggling to deal with the economic and psychological strains of life on standby. The United States remains consumed by the disease, leading the world in total COVID-19 deaths and infections.  In the United States, there has been a “disproportionate burden of illness and death among racial and ethnic minority groups,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  
COVID-19 health complications range in severity from mild respiratory illness to more serious complications, including death. More mild symptoms include cough, fever, and trouble breathing. The CDC recommends that anyone experiencing symptoms isolate themselves and reach out to a healthcare provider. Georgetown students can contact the Student Health Center at (202) 687-2200. 
November 16
Administrators announced the university’s plans to bring up to 500 seniors back to campus for the spring semester, doubling the number of students living on campus as COVID-19 infections at Georgetown University and across the country continue to climb and break records. 
The university also stated it plans to host up to 200 hybrid classes for seniors and graduate students living on and near university campuses. 
The university additionally announced it will operate on an altered calendar in the spring semester to minimize travel. For undergraduate students, classes will start Jan. 25 to provide extra time between semesters. Spring break and Easter break will be combined into one break running from March 26 to April 5, according to the registrar’s academic calendar. 
University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) emphasized the provisional nature of Georgetown’s spring plans in a video address released alongside the email announcement.
“We are entering what we expect will be the most difficult months of the pandemic,” DeGioia said in the address. “We will monitor the status of the pandemic throughout November and December to determine whether we can achieve our goals for the start of the spring semester. Once the spring semester is underway, we will continue to closely monitor and, when necessary, adjust our approach.”
The same day as the spring plan announcement, university health officials reported that fifteen Georgetown students living near campus and no community members living on campus tested positive for COVID-19 the week of Nov. 8. In total, 24 community members tested positive last week, setting a new record for the number of weekly new cases reported during the fall.

The city has committed to providing devices and internet connectivity to students lacking such resources. Teachers will be providing a combination of live instruction and pre-recorded lectures and activities. 
August 28
The university announced enhanced COVID-19 testing procedures for faculty, students and staff who are living on or frequent campus. 
On-campus residents, non-resident community members approved to visit campus and contractors present on campus two or more nonconsecutive days a week must be tested twice per week at an on-campus testing site, according to an email from Provost Robert Groves to the campus community Friday.
Students living in the neighborhoods surrounding campus must test for the virus once a week using an at-home test kit. 
Previously, students living on or near campus were required to test at least four times: once before arriving on campus, once upon arrival, and once five and 10 days afterwards. Any student who reported symptoms would be required to test as well. The university did not clarify if it would continue the routine randomized testing of asymptomatic community members it intended to implement. 
August 26
The university established a new grant to financially assist faculty and staff who may be struggling to support their dependents as a result of the pandemic. Full-time faculty, staff, or academic and administrative professionals who have “incurred additional dependent care expenses” because of the pandemic may apply for a grant of up to $1,000. Staff who previously received financial assistance from the university through the GUCares emergency fund or the COVID-19 disaster relief fund may apply for a new grant. 
August 24
The total number of university community members to contract COVID-19 since March rose to 94, according to university health officials. 
August 23
Georgetown hosted its first wholly virtual convocation ceremony for first-year students. Instead of crowding into  McDonough Arena, freshmen tuned in on their laptops to observe the traditional rites of passage to the Hilltop. 
Programming featured speeches from administrators and students, the recitation of the national anthem and the Alma Mater and comments from campus religious leaders. 
“I can attest that all of us at Georgetown and, I suspect, you, watching this event from your home, deeply regret the distance that separates us today,” Provost Robert Groves said, recording in an empty Gaston Hall. “But from today on, we share your life, and you share ours.”  
August 20
The university hosted a virtual town hall to discuss on-campus living during the fall. During the event, a panel of six administrators provided an overview of the move-in process and responded to questions and concerns about campus life for the 500 students living on-campus this semester. 
Students on campus will be able to eat at the lower level of Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall and at Royal Jacket Deli. Leo’s will have vegetarian, vegan and halal options available to students, according to Katie Davis, the vice president of operations at Aramark. Royal Jacket will also be serving food from Epicurean and Company at its storefront in the Leavey Center. Hoya Hub, Georgetown’s student food pantry, will be open at its location in McShain Large Lounge in McCarthy Hall. 
All students living on campus are required to have a block meal plan to disincentivize students from leaving campus by ensuring that students have ready access to food near their residence halls, according to Davis. First-year students living on campus are registered by default into the Block 160 meal plan, which offers 160 meals per semester and $350 Flex dollars, while upperclassmen are automatically registered for the Block 100 meal plan, which offers 100 meals per semester and $250 Flex dollars. 
Students will be tested for COVID-19 at least three times when they’re on campus: once when they arrive, once five days after arriving and once ten days after arriving, according to interim Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Ranit Mishori (MED ’02). Students may be tested randomly throughout the course of the semester to identify possible asymptomatic carriers. Any students who report symptoms will have to be tested. 
Students will be able to report violations of COVID-19 rules to a review panel currently being developed by administrators, according to Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson. 
Administrators strongly encourage students on campus to return home by Thanksgiving if it is safe and feasible for them to do so. 
“We fully recognize that this may be difficult for some, in which case we would work with those particular students to ensure that they can stay on campus up until winter break,” Director of Residential Education Eddie Carreon said during the call. 
Yates Field House will not be operational this fall. 
August 19
As some Georgetown students began to move into their on-campus residencies, university officials published details about move-in logistics. 
Administrators encouraged students living on campus to pack lightly and be prepared to depart campus within 48 hours should campus completely shut down. 
Students returning to campus received the first of several on-campus COVID-19 tests upon arrival. All students traveling to D.C. from abroad or from a list of high-risk states and students who have come in close contact with a person with COVID-19 must self-quarantine for 14 days. 
During the self-quarantine period, students may not leave their residences unless they are emptying their trash, doing their laundry or caring for a service animal. Students may also leave their residences for medical appointments or necessary testing. Students who are not coming from high-risk states or foreign countries must quarantine until they test negative for COVID-19 twice.  
August 18
D.C. approved Georgetown’s revised fall reopening plan, giving the university the official go-ahead to resume partial on-campus operations in the fall. 
The university originally planned to house approximately 2,000 students on campus, including all first-year students and select upperclassmen. The university also redesigned classrooms, retrofitting some with cameras and enhanced microphones, with the intention of hosting some classes in a hybrid format. 
Georgetown walked back its plan in late July as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened across the nation. The university disinvited freshmen, resident assistants and ROTC members from campus, electing to house only 500 students on campus, students who applied to live on campus because of complicated living situations and students who need to be on campus for coursework. All classes will begin virtually. 
August 17
University health officials confirmed a total of 93 university community members have contracted COVID-19 since March. 
August 10
Georgetown administrators published new information about student financial aid in response to ongoing confusion and frustration with financial aid cuts and miscalculations. 
The university said it would recalculate financial aid packages by Aug. 26 to account for waived summer work contributions. The university will also reconsider financial aid eligibility for students who have seen a drop in income in 2020. Starting Aug. 16, students will also be able to apply for emergency loans of up to $2,500 to cover various school expenses. The university said it will issue an additional $20 million in financial assistance to students for the fall semester on top of the $140 million previously allocated for the fiscal year. 
The university also decided to extend the billing period to increase student flexibility. Tuition will be charged Aug. 31, and billing statements will be issued Sept. 1. 
Students with questions or concerns about their financial aid should contact the Office of Student Financial Services by calling 202-687-4547 or emailing [email protected].
University health officials also reported that the number of university community members confirmed to have COVID-19 rose to 87. 
August 6
The Georgetown University Student Association hosted a teach-in to answer student questions about financial aid concerns in light of ongoing controversy surrounding financial aid reductions and expected family contribution increases. Dean of Student Financial Services Patricia McWade was scheduled to attend the event and answer student questions but pulled out just before the event’s start time, according to GUSA officials. 
During the event, GUSA officials walked through the financial aid process and attempted to answer questions using the limited information they had gleaned from previous meetings with administrators. 
GUSA officials also disclosed recently compiled results from a student survey about the financial aid process. Fewer than 20% of student respondents said their financial aid adviser has been helpful in addressing their financial aid concerns, according to GUSA data. The data also showed that about 50% of students surveyed reported having a higher expected family contribution value for the upcoming school year. 
GUSA officials discouraged students from accepting their financial aid packages if their need was not met, urging them to contact their financial aid advisers and file appeals if a change in financial circumstances had not been accounted for in their aid.
Panelists were unsure how the $2,900 tuition credit would be applied, lacking university confirmation. 
GUSA officials have also received mixed signals about the implementation of the modest living allowance, a university stipend offered to students living off campus designed to cover food and housing costs. During a town hall about off-campus housing the previous day, Olson suggested that hundreds of students have had this living allowance factored into their aid packages, though GUSA officials say they have not received clear confirmation. 
August 4
In light of recent student anger and confusion about newly released financial aid packages, the university announced it would offer a tuition credit to many undergraduate students on financial aid. Students with an expected parent contribution of $2,900 — 10% of tuition — or more will be eligible for a tuition credit up to $2,900, according to an email from McWade. Students with an expected parent contribution of less than $2,900 will receive a credit for the value of their family’s contribution. 
In the same message, McWade announced the university would be offering waivers for student contributions to those students who were unable to find paying work over this summer. 
Meanwhile, the number of total university community members confirmed to have COVID-19 rose to 85, according to university health officials. 
August 1
The university appointed Mishori as interim chief public health officer. Mishori will be responsible for advising the university on its COVID-19 response and managing the school’s testing and contact tracing programs. 
The position of chief public health officer was formerly held by Dr. Vince WinklerPrins. The university has not made any public announcement explaining the WinklerPrins’ departure. 
July 31
Georgetown announced it would no longer invite resident assistants back to campus and suspended the position for the fall. Administrators had previously said the university would keep some RAs on campus in the July 29 announcement concerning the decision not to house first-year students on campus. RAs have the opportunity to apply for on-campus housing through the housing application process. 
July 30
American University announced it will be fully virtual in the fall and reduce tuition by 10%. AU originally planned to house sophomores and first-year students on campus in the fall and host classes in a hybrid format. 
July 29
Georgetown administrators announced the university will no longer host first-year students on campus, and all students will begin the semester taking classes online. 
The university had previously announced in early July that it would house around 2,000 students — including the entire class of 2024 — on campus and host some classes in a hybrid format. Students who have been approved to live on campus will still be able to live in campus residences. First-year students in difficult housing situations will be able to apply for on-campus housing. All first-year students on F-1 visas will be invited to live on campus, according to a follow-up email from Provost Robert Groves. 
The university will not allow rejected upperclassmen students to reapply for on-campus housing, according to emails from administrators obtained by The Hoya. Rejected students maintain the ability to appeal their decision if their housing circumstances have changed “materially” since their rejection. They can appeal their decisions by emailing [email protected]
All undergraduate classes will begin online, and all graduate courses will be online for at least the first four weeks of the fall semester. The university may choose to resume in-person instruction should health conditions improve. 
In light of curricular changes, the university has also decided to reduce tuition by 10% for all undergraduates, expanding the original discount that had only applied to students living off campus. Tuition for graduate students will also be reduced by 5%; the university previously planned not to change graduate student tuition. 
July 27
The total number of university community members confirmed to have COVID-19 rose to 80, according to university health officials. 
Meanwhile, administrators at The George Washington University announced that the university would move classes online in the fall, marking a drastic shift in the school’s fall reopening plan. GWU originally announced in June that it would welcome all students back to campus and host classes in a hybrid format.  
July 24
The D.C. government issued an order mandating that anyone traveling to the District for non-essential activities from a “high-risk area” self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. The order will remain in effect through Oct. 9 or until the city ends its state of emergency. 
The city has designated 27 states — including California, Florida and Texas — as high-risk areas. People returning to or arriving in the District from high-risk areas after essential travel only need to monitor their symptoms and limit their contact with others. 
July 22
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) issued a new mask order amid an upswing in COVID-19 cases in the District. The order requires that people wear masks when in public and unable to maintain a distance of at least six feet from others. 
The order also requires that businesses and other establishments open to the public put up signs indicating that individuals must wear masks while visiting. Businesses must expel people who do not wear a mask or who remove their mask. 
July 21
Provost Robert Groves announced the university would cut tuition by 10% for students living off campus in the fall. Students living on campus will be charged the previously announced tuition of $28,692 for the fall 2020 semester. It is unclear how the policy impacts the earned family contribution threshold, so it is uncertain if students paying financial aid will see an actual drop in costs for the fall. 
“The University takes this step in recognition that undergraduate students who return to campus will have access to certain services that will be unavailable to off-campus students,” Groves wrote in an email to undergraduate students. 
Students living on campus will be charged the double-occupancy room rate instead of the more expensive single-occupancy room rate. Students living on campus will also receive 20% discounts on food and housing costs. If Washington, D.C. health officials prevent any students from returning to campus before the start of the fall semester, all students will receive a 10% tuition discount. 
In light of these financial changes, Groves said administrators will reevaluate financial aid packages. Many students have expressed concerns about the tuition decrease, fearing the cuts will hurt essential services offered to low-income students. 
The university will not reduce tuition for graduate students, according to a message sent to grad students the same day.   
July 20
The number of university community members with COVID-19 climbed to 76. 
July 16
Georgetown administrators and the Georgetown University Student Association co-hosted a town hall to answer questions about the university’s fall semester plans. 
Administrators did not provide many new details about what the fall semester will look like, and they did not field live questions from the audience. 
Vice Provost for Education Rohan Williamson said the university would continue its spring semester grading system in the fall. Students will be able to take classes for a letter grade or a designation of satisfactory, credit or no-credit. Students will have until Dec. 10 to decide whether or not to take a class for a letter grade. 
Dean of Student Financial Services Patricia McWade announced that financial aid decisions for all students will be published by July 31. Financial aid information for first-year and transfer students has already been made available. 
July 14
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security rescinded a July 6 guidance requiring international students to leave the United States if they took an online-only course load in the fall following a federal lawsuit filed by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology against DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
July 8
Georgetown joined other universities and colleges in submitting an amicus brief to federal court in opposition to DHS’s rule that would have prevented international students on F-1 and M-1 visas from taking fully online curricula while residing in the United States. 
“The new requirements fail to recognize the invaluable contributions of our international students within our community and the impacts of this abrupt change during an ongoing pandemic,” University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) wrote in the email announcement. 
July 7
Groves elaborated on details regarding the university’s plans to reopen in the fall in an email to undergraduate students. 
Groves expanded the list of upperclassmen who will be allowed to live on campus to include nursing students whose clinical work is required to receive licensure, seniors enrolled in 5-year bachelor’s and master’s programs, ROTC cadets and seniors with previously approved thesis or capstone projects that require campus buildings. 
Classrooms have been enhanced with cameras and microphones to facilitate hybrid learning, Groves added. First-year students and select upperclassmen will move to campus during an extended move-in period running from Aug. 17 to Aug. 24. Classes are set to begin Aug. 26, two days before the previously set start date. 
In a separate email, Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson elaborated on housing and financial aid policy for the fall. Students “whose personal or family situation makes it impossible or unrealistic to pursue their studies at their permanent address” were encouraged to apply for on-campus housing. First-year students and students who lived on campus during the spring or summer do not have to reapply. Students living off campus will receive a “modest living allowance” in place of financial aid coverage of living expenses, the email added. 
First-year students must accept or deny their housing placement by July 17. Upperclassmen accepted to live on campus have until July 24 to accept their on-campus housing placement. 
July 6
Georgetown announced its long-awaited plans for the fall 2020 semester. The university plans to allow 2,000 undergraduate students to live on campus in the fall, according to a universitywide email. All first-year students and select upperclassmen, including some residential assistants, students who need to take classes in person, and students with unstable home situations will be able to live on campus. These students are also eligible to select a fully remote semester. 
Students living on campus will be required to live in single-occupancy dorms spread across Georgetown’s main campus. Students will be tested for COVID-19 prior to arriving on campus and will monitor their symptoms throughout the semester while adhering to strict health and safety community guidelines. Additionally, most students living on campus will be required to move out by Nov. 20 and finish the remainder of the fall semester virtually from their permanent residences. 
The university has encouraged students who have already secured off-campus housing or who wish to do so to remain at their permanent residencies. 
Earlier in the day, ICE introduced a new rule preventing students on F-1 and M-1 visas from living in the United States while taking an online-only course load in the fall. For universities implementing a hybrid model, international students on F-1 visas may only enroll in a limited number of online courses. Georgetown graduate and law schools previously announced their intentions to hold classes both in-person and online. 
In response, students began circulating a petition demanding the university take steps to protect international students from possible deportation by creating more in-person classes and allowing international students to reside on campus. 
June 29
Protesters in Freedom Plaza organized a D.C. Excluded Workers rally to support workers from the District who are excluded from cash assistance programs such as the CARES Act. Such workers include sex workers, workers in the informal economy, the nearly 25,000 undocumented residents who live in the District. Protesters are asking the Council of the District of Columbia to invest $30 million in aid for these workers. The Georgetown University Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, an initiative founded to promote workers’ rights and the future of the labor movement, expressed support for the protests. Georgetown health officials reported that the total number of university community members confirmed to have COVID-19 rose to 70. 
June 22
Georgetown students began circulating a petition calling on administrators to reduce tuition and extend the deferral deadline for the fall 2020 semester amid ongoing uncertainty about the university’s plans to restart on-campus operations in the fall. 
“For $28,000 a semester, we the students and customers expect to receive a world-class education supported by in-class debates, healthy discussions outside the classroom, field trips to engage with primary source material, and extra-curricular enrichment, among a number of other factors,” the petition reads. “A Zoom education taken either in your dorm room or your parents’ basement is objectively not worth a $28,000 per semester commitment.”
University officials are considering four possible reopening options for the fall semester, according to official slides obtained by The Hoya. Three of the plans entail bringing some students back to campus; however, campus life and classroom learning will transform dramatically as the university plans on enforcing strict health guidelines. In January, university officials announced a 3.5% hike in tuition, driving up costs to $28,692 per semester. 
The petition has garnered 155 signatures as of Tuesday night. 
Earlier in the day, D.C. moved into Phase Two of its reopening plan after meeting several key health criteria.
Under Phase Two of the plan, restaurants, libraries, retail stores and other establishments can restart limited in-person services so long as they follow social distancing rules and limit occupancy to half of normal capacity.  
Places of worship are encouraged to continue services online but may resume in-person practices if they maintain social distancing between guests, limit occupancy to below half and refrain from practices that might facilitate the spread of germs, such as choir singing. 
Colleges and universities can also resume in-person services under Phase Two so long as they have reopening plans approved by the city. Georgetown has not yet submitted plans to the city to reopen its main campus, according to a June 20 message from Provost Robert Groves. 
Meanwhile, the number of confirmed university community members with COVID-19 rose to 68. 
June 18
Georgetown’s School of Continuing Studies will host all its classes online in the fall, according to a message from Kelly Otter, the dean of the SCS. 
“As much as we would like to open up our building and welcome you back for classes in the fall, a deep analysis into our full- and part-time course offerings, student population, and concentrated evening class schedule have led us to this difficult decision,” Otter wrote. 
Other Georgetown graduate programs and the Georgetown University Law Center will be hosting classes online and in person. 
June 17
Georgetown’s undergraduate academic councils, which consult with administrators on academic policy, sent a list of proposals for the fall semester to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) and other high-level university officials.  
The letter urges administrators to “prioritize equity and flexibility” in its academic policies and outlines specific recommendations for the fall 2020 semester. The letter recommends, at minimum, that the university continue with the satisfactory, credit or no credit system of the previous semester and allow students to opt-in to the system after final examinations. 
The letter also calls on schools to eliminate grade curves, expand access to online academic resources and refrain from the use of testing surveillance systems like Proctorio. The letter also encourages the administration to adopt asynchronous learning cycles for students who may live outside the Eastern time zone, a proposal put forth in an earlier petition from international students. 
Meanwhile, the city government announced that the District is on track to enter Phase Two of reopening as early as Monday. The city has met several key health standards that would enable it to commence Phase Two, including a continued decline in community spread of the coronavirus and hospital occupancy below 80%. The city has yet to meet certain contact tracing standards, according to government officials. 
Phase Two of reopening would allow retail spaces to open for limited in-store service and give the go-ahead for universities and places of worship to open for in-person activities. 
June 16
University administrators published slides detailing four possible plans for the undergraduate fall 2020 semester. The slides provide greater specificity about the scenarios currently under university consideration and offer a glimpse of potential on-campus life during the pandemic. The four possible scenarios for the fall semester are:
The university has not yet chosen a plan to pursue. Georgetown graduate schools and the Georgetown University Law Center previously announced plans to reopen in the fall and teach students under a hybrid teaching model. 
The slides also disclosed guidelines for campus activity should students return in the fall, presenting a drastic transformation of campus life designed to minimize interaction between students and reduce the spread of the coronavirus. 
If students return to campus in the fall, many classes will be held in hotels or online, according to the slides. There will be no in-person dining; all meals will be “grab and go.” There will be routine screening at campus and building entrances and strict limitations on social gatherings.  
All in-person classes must space students roughly 6.5 feet apart, and classes may be organized on a staggered schedule to minimize hallway traffic in between periods. Some classes may be hosted in large common spaces on campus, such as Gaston Hall or the Healey Family Student Center, or in hotel ballrooms to ensure appropriate distance in between students. 
June 15 
University leaders provided a slate of updates about the fall semester. 
The university extended its moratorium on university-sponsored student travel into the fall semester, according to a universitywide email from Provost Robert Groves. As a result of the extension, all fall 2020 study abroad and exchange programs have been canceled. The latest update does not affect university-sponsored travel for faculty or staff. In April, the university canceled all fall 2020 study abroad programs set to begin Aug. 1.  
“Our decision was made in the interest of the health and safety of our community, taking into account the dynamic nature of the global public health situation, significant current limitations on international travel, and the ability to appropriately support students abroad during this time of uncertainty,” Groves wrote in the email. 
In a separate email, Georgetown’s graduate programs announced their intention to reopen in the fall and offer classes in a “hybrid format.” Under the proposed system, which must be approved by the city, graduate students would have the option to take classes online or in person. The university will disclose more details in the coming weeks, according to administrators. The Georgetown University Law Center announced preliminary plans for fall reopening that entailed a similar hybrid learning model June 10. 
University health officials also announced that the number of community members known to have been infected with COVID-19 rose to 67. 
June 11
University officials published plans for a “phased restarting” of in-person research initiatives after the campus shutdown and nationwide lockdowns derailed research activities earlier this year. The plan outlines guidelines for research projects that become gradually more lenient as phased reopening occurs. 
Members of “research units”—defined as laboratories, research groups, faculty members or other research facilities—must submit detailed plans to resume their research through an online portal for university approval. Researchers, who can resume their work during Phase Two of the city’s reopening if their plan is approved, must use personal protective equipment, maintain social distance and follow a host of other health rules. 
June 10
The Georgetown University Law Center published preliminary plans to resume in-person instruction in the fall. 
Under the proposal, students can choose to take classes in-person or continue remote learning. The Law Center plans on shifting all classes online after Thanksgiving break before an anticipated second wave of coronavirus cases. The plan would also limit the size of classes for first-year law students to fewer than 40 students. The plan is subject to approval from the D.C. government. 
Meanwhile, as protests continue throughout the District, Director of the District of Columbia Department of Health Dr. Laquandra Nesbitt encouraged demonstrators to get tested for coronavirus and, if possible, work from home for 14 days to ensure they do not have symptoms. The previous day, two members of the D.C. National Guard patrolling the protests tested positive for COVID-19. 
June 9
In a lengthy message to the campus community, University President John DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) announced the university’s intention to unveil fall reopening plans in the coming weeks. 
The statement included no concrete details about the school’s plans to reopen campus in the fall. DeGioia said the administration was “exploring approaches ranging from fully-virtual to approaches that balance virtual learning with on-campus presence.” 
The District will allow the university to reopen for on-campus instruction assuming the city enters Phase Two of its reopening and approves the university’s proposal, according to the email. During Phase Two of the city’s reopening plan, retail stores, gyms, libraries, schools and places of worship will be allowed to resume limited in-person activities. Should the city continue to meet the necessary health metrics, officials expect to begin the next phase June 19 at the earliest, according to Mayor Bowser. 
Many students criticized DeGioia’s message as vague and indecisive, and student frustration about fall semester uncertainty has mounted. 
June 8
University health officials confirmed that 65 members of the university community have tested positive for COVID-19. 
As part of the city’s Phase One reopening efforts, D.C. officials designated seven streets as “slow streets,” designed to accommodate increased pedestrian traffic and ensure continued social distancing practices. The speed limit on these streets is limited to 15 miles per hour. The section of 19th Street NW between Dupont Circle and Biltmore Street NW, which cuts through Wards 1 and 2, is one such street. 
June 1
The number of university community members that have tested positive for COVID-19 climbed to 64, according to university health officials. 
May 29 
The D.C. government lifted the city’s stay-at-home-order, initiating Phase One of the four-stage reopening process. In the first phase of reopening, nonessential retail businesses may conduct curbside or delivery sales but may not allow customers into the store. Barbershops and hair salons may reopen with stations spaced six feet apart. Restaurants may also reopen for in-person service if tables are spaced six feet apart and no more than six people gather at one table. Playgrounds, public pools, gyms and recreational centers will remain closed. Gatherings of 10 or more people are still prohibited. 
May 27
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced that the city would begin gradually reopening after meeting several key health standards. The city recorded a 14-day decline in community spread of the coronavirus, one of the guidelines set by the mayor that, if met, would enable a reopening process. The District’s stay-at-home-order will be lifted May 29.
In the first phase of reopening, nonessential retail businesses may conduct curbside or delivery sales but may not allow customers into the store. Barbershops and hair salons may reopen with stations spaced six feet apart. Restaurants may also reopen for in-person service so long as tables are spaced six feet apart and no more than six people gather at one table. Playgrounds, public pools and recreational centers will remain closed. Gatherings of 10 or more people are still prohibited. 
The District’s reopening efforts were thrown into doubt in previous days following a spike in new cases May 24 and a persistently high positive testing rate that hovered around 12% before falling to the 10% maximum threshold recommended by experts May 23. 
The first phase of reopening will not impact Georgetown University’s operating status and other campus regulations regarding gatherings and face coverings, according to a message from provost Robert Groves. 
May 26
University health officials reported that the number of Georgetown community members with COVID-19 reached 61. So far, former NBA star and Georgetown men’s basketball Head Coach Patrick Ewing (CAS ’85) is the only identified case. 
May 25Ewing was released from a local hospital after announcing May 22 that he had tested positive for COVID-19, according to a Twitter statement from his son. 
May 22
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) announced D.C. public schools will resume classes August 31; however, no decision has been made as to whether the classes will be in person or online. The mayor also announced that the Mayor Marion S. Barry Summer Youth Employment Program, a popular summer youth initiative that provides subsidized work opportunities, will be primarily hosted online.  
May 21
Members of the Georgetown University Student Association Executive and Senate met with Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson and other senior Georgetown University officials Thursday evening to discuss the school’s plans for a possible fall reopening. 
According to GUSA Vice President Bryce Badger, who attended the meeting, the university intends to announce a plan for the fall semester by late June. In the event that the university invites students back to campus, administrators have considered implementing a one-student-per-room policy, in which every student lives in a single, according to meeting notes. Administrators have also weighed reducing in-person class sizes to 30% capacity. 
The university declined to comment on any specific details discussed during the meeting. No definitive plans have been determined, according to a university spokesperson. 
“During the meeting, university administrators talked through several different tentative scenarios that institutions of higher education are considering for the fall in order to operate in the safest possible way,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These scenarios are guided by public health information to ensure the health and safety of our entire community. Many factors are still uncertain and evolving, and nothing has been decided.”
Meanwhile, D.C. approached a set of hospitalization and infection standards that would allow the city to begin a phased reopening. The standards, set by the city, require a 14-day decrease in community spread of the virus, a steady, low transmission rate, hospital occupancy below 80% and robust testing and contract tracing before reopening can begin. The city has seen an 11-day decrease in community spread and has met standards for transmission rate and testing as of May 21. 
Additionally, a Georgetown graduate student in the McDonough School of Business filed a class-action lawsuit against the university for failing to adequately reimburse tuition money as the school transitioned to online learning. The lawsuit claims Georgetown has been unjustly charging students for services they are not receiving in an online environment. The plaintiff submitted the case, which was filed to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, under the pseudonym “John Doe”; the anonymous submission was rejected and the case is expected to be refiled. Similar cases have been brought against other institutions, including Brown University, Boston University and Emory University, for their failure to adequately repay tuition costs. Georgetown has refunded student room and board costs for the remainder of the spring semester after March 16, but the university has not refunded tuition.  
May 18
Georgetown University issued an ordinance requiring all employees, students and visitors to wear a face covering while on campus, according to an email to the campus community from Provost Robert Groves. The announcement follows a May 13 issuance from the city government requiring people to wear masks when working in close proximity to others or when in public and unable to socially distance.  
Later in the day, university health officials reported that the number of Georgetown community members with COVID-19 — including students, faculty and staff — climbed to 55. 
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) also announced that the city has experienced eight days of declining coronavirus community spread. Should community spread continue to decline during the next six days, the city may begin to initiate a reopening process before the end of the month. The city wants to see a two-week stretch of declining community spread before reopening, according to The Washington Post. To date, D.C. has met other standards set by the mayor that would allow reopening parts of the city, including maintaining hospital capacity rates below 80% and increasing testing for high-risk populations. Virginia and Maryland have already initiated phased reopenings. 
May 17
In a virtual commencement ceremony, 187 newly minted physicians graduated from the Georgetown University School of Medicine. GUSOM graduates will be entering the field during one of the most trying medical crises in recent memory. Many GUSOM students have tried to help tackle the crisis while on campus, gathering much-needed supplies for professionals combatting the COVID-19 pandemic and helping treat COVID-19 patients virtually. 
May 16
The Georgetown University Class of 2020 graduated. The university hosted a virtual degree-awarding celebration for the graduating class on Facebook Live. The 2020 Conferral of Degrees in Course ceremony, which lasted just over 30 minutes, featured speeches from university administrators and brief sermons from Rabbi Rachel Gartner and Rev. Mark Bosco, S.J. Individual schools distributed awards to graduating seniors the previous day during Tropaia Exercises. 
Following a centuries-old procedure, President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) recited the brief commencement dictum, certifying the graduation of undergraduate and graduate students on the main campus and students at the Georgetown University Law Center. The degree-awarding ceremony caps off a turbulent and upsetting spring semester, one which has left some seniors with a missing sense of closure to their Georgetown careers. 
Students at Georgetown’s campus in Doha, Qatar, also graduated May 16 after educators and students worked to adapt to an online learning environment. 
May 15
Washington, D.C., opened applications for the Educational and Academic Retail Shops Pilot, a program which will allow particular retail shops to open for business and deliver goods curbside to consumers. Six shops, including Lost City Bookstores and Politics and Prose, are slated to open. D.C. also expanded its small business microgrant program, allocating an extra $800,000 for businesses in Wards 7 and 8. 
May 14 Georgetown international students began circulating a petition on social media encouraging the university to introduce academic and logistical reforms to support international students, a campus community that has been adversely impacted by the transition to online learning. The petition, which has garnered more than 200 student signatures and 14 faculty signatures, requests the introduction of asynchronous academic schedules for students living in different time zones and clear procedures for entering and leaving the United States. 
May 13
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser extended the District’s stay-at-home order through June 8. The number of cases and deaths in the city continues to climb, with total cases topping 6,500 and deaths reaching 350 as of May 13. Bowser originally issued the stay-at-home order March 30. 
Additionally, beginning May 16, face masks will be required on all public transit including, Metrorail, Metrobus, Circulator buses, and MARC trains. Though riders were previously asked to wear a mask, it is now a requirement both in stations and while in transit. All taxi and ride-share passengers must also wear masks. New requirements do not apply to children under the age of nine or for people experiencing homelessness. 
May 12
University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) announced additional spending cuts to ease the financial burden of the pandemic in a letter to the Georgetown community. The university expects to lose at least $50 million by the start of the fall semester because of refunds and other pandemic-related expenses. To overcome this shortfall, the university will continue its pause on hiring, discretionary spending, and salary increases. The university will also suspend contributions to faculty retirement funds and pause merit salary increases. Additionally, 54 members of Georgetown’s leadership have voluntarily taken pay cuts. The letter also introduced voluntary furlough and pay cut programs, through which university employees can opt to forego pay to support the university financially. 
Democratic legislators in the House of Representatives introduced a bill that would grant D.C. a supplementary $755 million in federal funding to weather the pandemic after only being allocated $500 million under the CARES Act. The federal assistance bill offered states a minimum of $1.25 billion in funding. 
States bordering the District began putting their reopening plans on hold. Gov. Ralph Northam (D-Va.) issued an executive order allowing counties and jurisdictions in northern parts of the state to delay reopening because of continuing struggles to contain the spread of the coronavirus. As of May 12, Virginia has 25,800 confirmed cases and just under 900 deaths. Gov. Larry Hogan (R-Md.) announced plans to introduce similar delays for certain areas of the state. 
May 11
The number of Georgetown-affiliated people including students, faculty and staff with COVID-19 climbed to 50, according to an alert from university health officials. 
May 8 
Georgetown notified students that it would be distributing $2,600 grants to students who contributed less than $15,000 to their university-related expenses during the academic year. The university received $3.06 million in federal aid from the CARES Act in April to assist students during the pandemic. Students ineligible for federal funding will receive grants directly from the university.  
May 1
After Georgetown seniors pressed against the cancellation of commencement ceremonies in March, the university announced it would be hosting virtual degree-awarding ceremonies May 16 and 17 ahead of future in-person celebrations at an unspecified date. 
April 22
The university announced it would use the reformed grading system for the summer semester. Students taking summer classes will have the option to take their classes for a letter grade or a designation of satisfactory, credit or no credit. Additionally, the university announced students would not face suspension or dismissal for poor academic performance during the spring 2020 semester. 
April 21
The Department of Education published a guidance prohibiting undocumented students and DACA recipients from receiving federal aid that had been doled out to support universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Though Congress did not specify any standards for documentation status, the DOE ordinance decreed that only those students who are eligible for federal financial aid — U.S. citizens and some permanent residents — can receive the newly distributed federal funding, according to The Hill. 
The ordinance will also bar many international students from receiving federal support. 
April 9
The DOE unleashed $6.28 billion of federal funding set aside by Congress to assist U.S. colleges and universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Georgetown received $3.06 million in aid. Schools with larger student enrollment received greater financial assistance. 
Congress passed a $2 trillion aid package known as the CARES Act to cushion U.S. hospitals, families and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, allocating a total of $14 billion to support U.S. universities and colleges. 
Universities must use the funds to financially support students during the transition to online learning, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos wrote in a letter to college and university presidents. 
“The only statutory requirement is that the funds be used to cover expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus (including eligible expenses under a student’s cost of attendance, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child care),” DeVos wrote. 
April 7
To alleviate the financial stresses of the campus shutdown, the university announced a freeze on new hiring, salary increases, and discretionary spending. The university has spent $25 million over the past several weeks to bankroll various pandemic-related expenses, including room and board refunds and emergency funds. New hiring “will be limited to only mission critical roles as determined by the Executive Vice Presidents and the Chief Operating Officer,” according to the university. 
April 3
The Georgetown University Law Center implemented a mandatory pass/fail grading policy for all J.D. students, according to an email from Executive Vice President and Dean William Treanor sent to all GULC students. Masters of Laws students can choose to take their classes pass/fail. 
April 2
Georgetown announced a change in grading policy for both undergraduate and graduate students in a universitywide email from Provost Robert Groves.
Under the new system, students retain the option to either receive letter grades for their classes or be graded under a modified pass/fail system. For classes in which students opt in to the alternate grading framework, students will receive a Satisfactory designation for grades A to C, a Credit designation for grades C- to D and a No-Credit designation for an F, according to the email.
Students can make the decision to switch to the modified pass/fail system beginning April 6 and will have the option to do so until the last day of classes April 28. Undergraduate students will be able to make the decision without approval from their academic deans. Graduate students are still required to seek approval from their respective director of graduate studies.
The decision to modify the grading system was meant to take into account difficult circumstances students may face while adjusting to an online environment, according to Groves’ email.
“In our decision-making we were guided by a compassionate consideration of students who are suffering under the conditions of dislocation due to the pandemic and are unable to work or perform at the same level they were before,” Groves wrote. “Through the addition of CR, students who might slip into the C-, D+, and D range are assured of passing and of not having to repeat a course.”
In the preceding days, the Georgetown University Student Association teamed up with student advocates to push for the introduction of a Double A grading system, in which students would finish the semester with an A or A- grade for all of their classes. 
Since the announcement of the revised grading system, many students have expressed frustration on social media with the new system, claiming it is too similar to the old one they attempted to reform. 
March 30
D.C. instituted a stay-at-home order, encouraging all of its residents to refrain from nonessential travel. In the preceding days, the number of COVID-19 cases in the District jumped.
The order offers residents some flexibility, allowing people to leave their homes to buy food and medicine, care for sick loved ones and exercise. Government workers and employees at essential businesses should report for their shifts, the order added. 
On the same day, the university reported that 175 undergraduate students and 110 law students are still living on campus, according to a universitywide email. Students were able to apply for on-campus accommodation after the university transitioned to instructional continuity. 
March 24
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) ordered the closure of all nonessential businesses and instituted a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people in an effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Essential businesses, which include health care providers, supermarkets and banks, are to remain open.  
March 18
Georgetown’s graduation ceremony was postponed indefinitely, according to an email from University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95). 
“After careful consideration, we have made the determination that it will be necessary to postpone Commencement activities to a time in which we can safely convene as a community,” DeGioia wrote. “I share this information with you today to reassure you that we are committed to holding Commencement ceremonies and to ensure that our students and families have as much time to prepare as possible.”
March 17
A letter to the administration calling on the university to postpone commencement instead of canceling the ceremony garnered over 1,100 signatures. 
“We believe graduating students deserve the opportunity not only to celebrate their accomplishments, but to do so with their family, friends and loved ones,” the letter says. “Commencement, undoubtedly, provides an opportunity for graduates to celebrate their academic achievements and relish the results of their years of hard work. And, in this moment of upheaval, an in-person commencement ceremony would allow graduates an opportunity for closure and reflection.” 
Organizers Madeline Charbonneau (COL ’20), Hannah Urtz (SFS ’20), Katrina Schmidt (SFS ’20), Maya Gandhi (SFS ’20) and Erin Doherty (COL ’20) sent the letter to the administration and student leaders Tuesday night. (Full disclosure: Urtz, Schmidt and Doherty formerly served as senior news editors for The Hoya. Charbonneau formerly served as an executive editor and Gandhi formerly served as  editor-in-chief for The Hoya.) 
Universities around the country, including The George Washington University, have canceled their commencement ceremonies. 
Later in the day, the university moved up the mandatory move-out date for students living in university owned housing, ordering campus residents to retrieve their belongings before March 22. Previously, students had until March 29 to move out of their dorms. The university also urged students living off campus to return to their permanent residences in the “strongest terms” in the email to students. Students who applied to live on campus for the duration of the semester will be notified with a decision by March 20, according to the email. 
U.S. officials could consider halting domestic flights in the coming days, according to CNBC. 
March 16
All study abroad programs, regardless of location, were suspended, according to an email sent from Office of Global Education Director Craig Rinker to all students currently enrolled in study abroad programs. 
Students are required to make flight arrangements to return to their permanent addresses as soon as possible. The suspension comes amid growing concerns about  travel accessibility as countries impose stricter regulation on travel, according to the email.
While some programs may be able to offer instructional continuity through remote learning, the university is creating solutions for other programs that do not have the option for online coursework, Rinker wrote in the email.
“We expect to announce the details of this coursework (including registration procedures) no later than Friday, March 20, 2020,” Rinker wrote. “We understand that this will involve a period of advising and transition in coursework. Your advising deans will work with you to make this transition as smooth as possible.”
The university will also work to alleviate the financial implications for students affected by their program suspensions by collecting travel details and reimbursement requests through an online survey sent to students, according to the email.
March 15
The first case of the coronavirus was reported in the Georgetown community, according to a universitywide email from Chief Public Health Officer Vince WinklerPrins. The student contracted COVID-19 while studying abroad and is seeking treatment at their permanent residence. The student had not been to any of Georgetown’s campuses.
Although the patient’s study abroad program has decided that other Georgetown students in the program do not need testing, the university is contacting other students in the program, according to WinklerPrins. 
“The individual’s program has conducted a contact trace of those who were in close contact with the individual and determined that no members of the Georgetown community required any additional testing or evaluation,” WinklerPrins wrote. “Out of an abundance of caution, we are reaching out to all Georgetown participants in that program.”
March 14
A series of changes in academic policy seeking to help students better adjust to online coursework were announced by Provost Robert Groves in a universitywide email. Among the changes, undergraduate students will be offered the option to make any of their classes graded on a pass/fail basis through the last day of classes before finals.
Students will additionally have the option to withdraw from any class through the last day of classes in the spring semester, though deans are still required to approve the withdrawal. Professors have also been advised to delay all assessments during the week of March 16 to a later date.
Professors are also instructed to grant excused absences through March 30 for any complications that may result from students transitioning housing or converting to online coursework. The university is encouraging professors to accommodate students moving to online learning, as well as to ask for student feedback. 
Though the transition may be difficult for students, the university will continue to work to provide resources and ensure students’ success in the classroom, according to Groves.
“We understand the sense of difference, dislocation and loss many of you are experiencing and the real challenges of the transition, which will affect each and every one of us in different ways. We know this semester will be challenging,” Groves wrote. “Our faculty are deeply concerned for you and your learning experience. Together, we will be with you every step of the way.”
March 13
Georgetown extended online coursework through the end of the academic year, according to a universitywide email from DeGioia. Students will move out of undergraduate residences beginning March 16. 
Students living in on-campus dormitories will not have to pay room and board costs for the remainder of the semester, according to a follow-up email from Groves. Other universities pivoting online have introduced similar policies. 
Students living on campus must retrieve their belongings sometime before March 29, Groves wrote. Students must fill out an online form by 12 p.m. on March 17 to indicate a time to return to campus and officially move out of their residence for the summer. 
All students are required to move their belongings out by March 29. If a student is unable to return to campus by then, the student is required to fill out an application, and the university will ship one box of essential items to the student’s permanent residence. The university will not dispose of personal belongings of those students with accepted applications.
Additionally, any student returning from a country with a Level 3 risk classification from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must self-quarantine for two weeks before they will be allowed to return to campus to move out.
Essential services will still remain open on campus. While all students are asked to return to their permanent residences, students with special circumstances may apply to remain on campus, though the university will not guarantee that any students’ applications will be accepted, according to Groves’ email.
The university is additionally reviewing plans for the continuation of the commencement ceremony in May and will make a decision about the event in the near future, according to DeGioia’s email.
The decision to forego in-person classes for the rest of the academic year is meant to further support actions aimed at slowing the transmission of COVID-19, which has ramped up in recent days, DeGioia wrote in the universitywide email.
“Over the past two days, there have been significant developments in the global, national, and local responses to the ongoing spread of the virus,” DeGioia wrote. “The actions we are taking at Georgetown seek to mitigate transmission of the virus—to slow ‘community spread’—and to protect the most vulnerable from its worst impacts.”
After the email announcement, students circulated a change.org petition calling for the university to offer students the option for spring 2020 semester classes to be graded on a pass/fail basis. As of 4 p.m., the petition has garnered over 1300 signatures.
The announcements arrive as professional and personal activity across the United States reaches a standstill. Earlier in the day, organizers postponed the Boston Marathon and the Masters golf tournament. Louisiana delayed its presidential primary election by two months. In addition, millions of students are out of school following statewide closures. Seven states announced the closure of all public schools indefinitely.
Also March 13, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that beginning March 16 all public schools in the district will close for at least two weeks. 
Trump declared a national emergency at 3:30 p.m. to release 50 billion of funds to states to tackle the COVID-19 outbreak. 
March 12
The OGE recalled all students in study abroad programs through Georgetown in the Schengen Area of Europe after President Donald Trump ordered a ban on all travel from 26 European countries the night before. Under Trump’s order, any U.S. citizen in Europe is allowed to fly back to the United States but must fly back to certain airports to undergo screening for COVID-19.
The CDC risk rating has also been raised to Level 3 for all European countries, not including the United Kingdom, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland, Turkey and Ukraine.
All students in affected programs are expected to return to their permanent addresses; however, plans to make up academic content may vary by program, a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Students with a permanent address in a CDC Level 3 country should return to an alternate permanent address outside of their home country,” the university spokesperson wrote. “Some students may have the option to continue their current program through instructional continuity or remote learning. That should be a first choice for completion. For all other students, the University is designing academic continuity solutions for undergraduate students to ensure that students will be able to earn a full semester of credit through new online coursework scheduled to run from the end of March through mid June.”
All students, faculty and staff returning from travel to affected European countries are required to self-quarantine at an off-campus residence for two weeks before they are allowed to return to campus, according to a March 12 email from WinklerPrins to all students.
While the status of other study abroad programs is still uncertain, the OGE sent an email to all Georgetown students currently enrolled in a study abroad program urging them to return to their permanent addresses.
Also on March 12, Georgetown canceled all spring athletics practices and competitions, according to a university news release. The decision comes after the NCAA and the Patriot League announced the cancellation of their spring sport tournaments.
Though the decision may come as a disappointment for student-athletes, Georgetown is prioritizing the safety of all athletes, according to Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Lee Reed.
“We recognize the deep disappointment that will be felt by our student-athletes, coaches, and communities — especially our seniors, who have contributed so much to the success of our programs over the last four years,” Lee wrote in the news release. “Please know this decision was made out of the utmost consideration for the health, safety and well-being of all.”
March 11
DeGioia announced in a universitywide email that all classes will take place online until further notice beginning March 16 in response to growing international concern around the spread of COVID-19. 
The university additionally recommends that all students complete the online coursework at their permanent addresses; however, campus buildings and some services, including the Georgetown University Police Department, the Student Health Center, Counseling and Psychiatric Services and the Fresh Food Company buffet, will remain open for students who decide to stay on campus.
Students who make the decision to remain on campus must fill out a form with the Office of Residential Living before March 17 at 12 p.m. to receive permission from the university to remain on campus, according to an FAQ page on the university’s website.
The Department of Planning and Facilities Management has also increased cleaning on campus, deploying additional staff to clean frequently touched points on campus. Facilities will also add 23 hand sanitizer dispensers around campus, according to the FAQs. University drivers are required to use disinfectant on high-touch points on all vehicles both before and after each ride.
Though there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Georgetown community, some members may have come into contact with the virus in recent days, according to DeGioia’s email. 
In a separate universitywide email, Groves outlined policies for faculty, staff and both graduate and undergraduate students as a result of the announcement. A more comprehensive explanation of the policies will be sent at a later time, according to the email.
Also on March 11, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program announced the cancellation of the early action GAAP Weekend. A decision on the two regular decision GAAP weekends in April will be made at a later date, according to an email sent to undergraduate GAAP ambassadors.
The university will provide admitted students with online resources to present them with information that would have been communicated to them during GAAP weekend, a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“In the coming weeks, Georgetown will make available a series of online lectures, chats, and experiences designed to connect future students with our academic life and campus community,” the university spokesperson wrote. “Our hope is to replicate much of the programming they would have experienced during the Open House.”
March 10 
The OGE announced a policy change for upcoming summer study abroad sessions in an email sent to students accepted to the programs. The office changed the deadline for students to commit their program from March 16 to March 23. The withdrawal period was also pushed to April 1 to allow students to withdraw from the programs with full refunds.
Georgetown also suspended all current study-abroad programs in Madrid, according to an OGE email obtained by The Hoya. The day before, the Spanish government closed Madrid universities for 15 days, leading to Georgetown’s decision. Other programs in Spain have not been suspended and will be reviewed on a program-to-program basis. 
American University announced March 10 that all classes would shift to online only through April 3. All Maryland public universities released a similar decision March 10 to move to online coursework effective after their spring break. 
GW announced that classes would move online through April 5. Students are able to remain on campus during their spring break, which runs from March 16 to March 21, though after March 21 students must apply to remain on campus, according to an email obtained by The Hoya.
Georgetown Day School, a private school in Northwest D.C., closed for the day on March 10 to deep clean the campus. The school’s administration came to the decision because of the number of community members who attend Christ Church Georgetown, according to a message posted on the school’s website. 
March 9 
Dean of Georgetown-Qatar Ahmad Dallal announced the suspension of all in-person classes and a conversion to online instruction at the Qatar campus effective March 11, according to an announcement on GU-Q’s website. All events at the campus have also been canceled.
GU-Q’s campus has been monitoring the situation since January, according to GU-Q Chief Communications Officer Moamer Qazafi. 
The school is working to address students’ concerns and will adjust its response if needed as it continues to track the spread of the disease, according to Qazafi.
“Student requests for improved internet connectivity are being addressed and they are being supplied with the tools and information to connect their devices to continue their studies,” Qazafi wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will continue to monitor the situation and inform our community as appropriate.”
Also on March 9, Julia Farr (CAS ’88), executive director of the Georgetown University Alumni Association, emailed graduates and parents to cancel John Carroll Weekend in Bermuda. The annual graduate gathering event was scheduled to take place in Bermuda after being relocated from Hong Kong because of ongoing protests in the area.
No plans exist to relocate John Carroll Weekend to another location, and all persons set to receive awards will be recognized at a separate date, Farr wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
“John Carroll Weekend is a cherished tradition, and the time we take to connect, celebrate, and honor service to our community is irreplaceable. Above all else, we prioritize the health and safety of our alumni, friends, families, employees, and contributors to the weekend,” Farr wrote. “We look forward to honoring our awardees in the future and will provide more detailed celebration plans as soon as we are able.”
School Without Walls High School, a D.C. public high school in Foggy Bottom, closed one day for a deep clean after a staffer came into contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19.
March 8 
In a schoolwide email, WinklerPrins announced that MedStar Georgetown University Hospital was treating the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in D.C.
Patient Timothy Cole, the reverend at Christ Church on 3116 O St. NW, was the first reported COVID-19 case in the District. Hundreds of individuals who attended services March 1 or who were at the church Feb. 24 or between Feb. 28 and March 3 have been asked to self-quarantine for 14 days, according to The Washington Post. 
Both the university and Medstar Hospital are working with officials to ensure the safety of all members of the Georgetown community, according to a March 8 email.
“While no one in the Georgetown community has tested positive for COVID-19, MGUH is working closely with the CDC and DC Health and following all CDC protocols for patients and any staff and medical students who may have been impacted. Their health and safety is our top priority,” WinklerPrins wrote. “We will continue to provide regular updates as we take additional measures to ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff.”
March 6
Spring break officially begins for Georgetown students.
The University of Washington announced that all of its classes would no longer be held in-person through the end of its winter semester, which ends March 20. UW released plans to resume normal operations and in-person classes March 30 but may reassess the decision pending further information, according to the university’s website.
March 5
All students who had traveled to affected locations were asked to self-quarantine for two weeks before returning to campus. Students who self-quarantined are also required to receive clearance from WinklerPrins before they can return to Georgetown’s campus, according to the March 5 email to students.
March 4
The university suspended all university-sponsored international travel, extending the moratorium to May 15. 
In addition, the university canceled all international alternative break programs, service learning spring break trips sponsored by the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service for students, faculty and staff, because of concerns about the spread of the virus.
March 2
The university announced a suspension of all university-sponsored travel to countries with the Level 3 risk classification from the CDC. At the time, the countries on the list include Iran, China, South Korea and Italy. The university also suspended all international travel unrelated to for-credit academics through April 1.
February 25
Georgetown announced a suspension of all university-related travel to South Korea for students, faculty and administrators after the CDC raised South Korea’s threat level to Level 3, advising against all nonessential travel. South Korea had reported more than 2,000 cases of the disease, the largest reported outbreak outside of China at the time. 
Study abroad programs at Villa Le Balze in Italy were also canceled amid outbreaks in Northern Italy after the death toll reached 11 people and the CDC categorized the country as Level 2, recommending travelers practice enhanced precautions when traveling to these countries. Students in the programs were instructed to return to the United States and will complete instructional continuity to account for coursework missed because of the program’s termination. 
February 18
The OGE postponed the School of Foreign Service Centennial Lab spring break trip to Cambodia because of concerns about the spread of the virus. The affected program, titled “Politics and Performance: Confronting the Past, Shaping the Future,” was canceled after reports that a cruise ship passenger who disembarked in Cambodia had tested positive for COVID-19.
Faculty leaders hoped to reschedule the trip for May, but a new date has not been announced. 
February 4
Georgetown asked students and faculty who had traveled to China in the previous two weeks to complete a survey documenting their interactions with those with novel coronavirus and potential symptoms in a statement on the university website. 
The first COVID-19 death outside of China — in the Philippines — was reported two days earlier, according to The New York Times. 
January 31 
The university issued an online statement to faculty and staff about potential measures to inform students about the COVID-19. The statement suggested that future instructional continuity online may become necessary. The same day, the Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar called the outbreak a public health emergency.
The statement came the day after the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. 
January 28
Georgetown announced a suspension of all university-sponsored or related travel to China. The university also canceled all spring study abroad programs in China after the CDC and the U.S. Department of State raised their travel advisories to recommend that people avoid nonessential international travel and reconsider travel to China. 
Seven Georgetown students were affected by the program cancellations. The university assisted students who wished to return to Georgetown for the remainder of the semester. 
January 24
The university issued a statement warning students and faculty against traveling to Wuhan after the outbreak of COVID-19.

Please correct the May 12th entry that indicates faculty are taking voluntary pay cuts. All employees have been asked to take voluntary pay cuts, not just faculty, and I’d make an educated guess that substantially more staff have volunteered than faculty have.

Is there an actual split of the 94 cases reported between cases reported from persons OFF campus (like students testing positive and reporting in as requested while living off campus/at home permanent address) vs those positive cases of people that are actually on campus/campus vicinity?

Tackling the COVID-19 pandemic requires decisive and coordinated leadership, a panel of public health and political experts said during a virtual Zoom forum March 19.
COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by a new coronavirus strain, originated in Wuhan, China, in November 2019 and was first reported by the Chinese government in December. Since then, there have been over 300,000 cases in 188 countries and territories around the world, with the highest mortality rate in Italy. As of press time, there have been 31,289 confirmed cases in the United States and 395 deaths, more than double the amount reported just last week, according to CNN.
Given the rapid spread of the virus, world leaders must organize and communicate effective plans of actions to their people, according to panelist Ron Klain (CAS ’83), who served as the U.S. Ebola response coordinator for the Obama administration.
“We need transparency, we need candor, we need science-led leadership,” Klain said. “That’s the kind of communication that’s going to reassure people and going to tell people we have a plan in place to fight this thing effectively.”
Many people have criticized President Donald Trump for his administration’s response to the pandemic so far, with over half of those surveyed ranking the response of the U.S. federal government as “poor” or “very poor,” according to a U.S. News & World Report survey. The United States has lagged behind in testing especially, only performing over 71,000 tests so far, while South Korea, which has around 9,000 reported cases, has tested over 270,000 people to date, according to NPR.
Although Trump placed travel restrictions on foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the last 14 days as of Jan. 31, the restrictions only temporarily stalled the larger crisis without setting proper contingency plans to limit the spread of the virus in the United States, according to Klain.
“Those travel restrictions slowed the spread of the disease, but they bought us time, not protection,” Klain said. “With that time, the Trump administration squandered the opportunity. They did not prepare us for testing. We have fallen behind every other developed country in the world for testing its people for this virus.”
In response to growing concerns around the COVID-19 outbreak, Georgetown University pivoted to online learning and announced that all students must move out of university-owned housing by March 22. With most students off campus, the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and the Georgetown Global Health Initiative hosted the forum event using Zoom, a remote conferencing software. 
The event, titled “Leadership During Crisis: Combating the Coronavirus,” was the first ever GU Politics virtual forum. Georgetown students, faculty and staff were asked to provide their Georgetown email address when responding interested to the event, so that GU Politics could then send out the link to join the Zoom conference, according to the event’s Facebook page.
Other panelists at the event included Chair of the National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services Jeff Colyer (CAS ’81), Director of Georgetown’s Center for Global Health Science and Security Rebecca Katz and Former Assistant Secretary of Treasury for the Trump Administration Tony Sayegh.
Policymakers must collaborate to provide necessary financial assistance to citizens as the pandemic continues to hurt the U.S. economy, Sayegh said.
“We’re all in this together and I really feel very strongly that one of the essence of the American DNA is we fight together and we win together,” Sayegh said. “And that’s where I feel we are starting to emerge, especially on the economic side with Congress working in such a bipartisan and bicameral way to provide direct relief to the American people.”
A major concern surrounding the pandemic is its projected effect on the global economy. Many economists are predicting a global recession, as the economies of major countries such as the United States and China come to a halt. Economists predict the U.S. economy will shrink 8% between April and June, according to CNN Business.
The biggest concern regarding the spread of the virus, however, is the potential for hospitals to be overrun with patients, which is a likely consequence of the U.S. government’s failure to enact timely protective measures, according to Klain.
“We are seeing this disease spread quickly in the country,” Klain said. “We didn’t do the testing right, we didn’t do the contact tracing, we didn’t get the hospitals ready, we don’t have the equipment where it needs to be and we are going to see the consequences of that in the days ahead.”
The urgency of the situation creates a need for quick and concise decision-making from political leaders, according to Coyler.
“You really have to have a leader that’s out there communicating every single day,” Colyer said. “People haven’t experienced this kind of war. This is a war that is on our shores right now so we’re in an entirely different environment and different political and decision-making environment.”

When Georgetown University students set out for spring break March 6, the coronavirus threat seemed distant, but looming. COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, claimed its first life in the United States less than a week before. As the virus raged across Europe and Asia, the university suspended international trips, but U.S. cases remained low and campus remained open. 
However, as students sought relaxation at crowded beach resorts and family outings, anxiety mounted. What was once an international concern quickly became a domestic one. The virus continued to spread and death tolls climbed. One day after spring break began, Washington, D.C., confirmed its first case of COVID-19. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, certifying the severity of the crisis. 
Universities across the United States took drastic measures to contain the outbreak, shifting classes online and telling students to move out of residence halls. Georgetown followed suit March 13. During the past month, the university has canceled all study abroad programs, postponed commencement ceremonies and pushed classes online for the remainder of the semester. 
The crisis that has upended life across the globe has derailed life at Georgetown. The Hoya interviewed students from some of the most affected campus communities by phone, video and text to get a sense of how the pandemic and the university’s responses are impacting their lives. 
First-Generation, Low-Income Students 
After Georgetown shut down its campus, Sarah Craig (SFS ’22) returned to her hometown of Detroit, where she had to undertake duties many of her peers do not have to perform.
Michigan closed its K-12 schools until the end of the school year in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. With her parents working full time in hospitals, Craig now has to help home-school her younger brother as she keeps up with assignments and virtual class sessions, she said. 
“I know a lot of first-generation, low-income students are facing similar challenges with financial issues and having to support younger siblings,” Craig said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “That’s still something I’m navigating — the emotional challenges of this, of now having these extra responsibilities.” 
Onrei Josh Ladao (COL ’21), a San Diego native, has also had to manage new responsibilities after returning home. 
“Just by the virtue of being back in San Diego with my family, I can’t be a student in the same way anymore,” Ladao wrote in a message to The Hoya. “I’m helping my family where I can, meaning I have to juggle those responsibilities while also being a student.”
There isn’t the time to create support for those students, and so we just kind of get left behind. – Sarah Craig (SFS’22)
Craig and Ladao are both first-generation college students from low-income backgrounds. Uprooted from a university setting, they will have to navigate a distinct set of obstacles to reconstruct their college lives at home. 
One of the biggest challenges is continuing academic life in an unfavorable learning environment, according to Craig. 
“I think it’s still just the uncertainty of returning to my house that is not suited for academics of this level,” Craig said. “Because my parents didn’t go to college, they don’t really understand just the degree of school that I’m doing. They don’t really have an understanding of what it means to be in school full time like this.”
Besides having to adjust to time differences, Ladao has encountered similar barriers to effective learning. 
“Making your home the new classroom is not an easy task,” Ladao wrote. “My family’s apartment is not conducive as a learning environment, and I have to make adjustments to the space around me in order to make it so.”
On March 17, Georgetown moved up the mandatory move-out date for students living in university-owned housing, ordering campus residents to retrieve their belongings before March 22. Previously, students had until March 29 to move out of their dorms. 
The anxiety of having to return home at a moment’s notice was compounded by countless financial considerations. 
“So many questions had clouded my mind,” Ladao wrote. “How was I going to pay for storage? Do I need to drop even more money to book a flight back to D.C.? Is it even safe for me to go back to D.C., considering the circumstances? There was no sense of stability whatsoever, and it wasn’t easy to make decisions because everything continued to change.” 
Low-income families must handle an extra financial burden when their kids return home from college, since their day-to-day expenses are largely covered by the university, Craig said. 
“For students who are either paying very little for school or they’re fully covered in terms of expenses and tuition, that’s one less person in a household that their family has to feed and take care of and provide for,” Craig said. “Now the student is returning to live with them and that’s one extra person the family has to provide for.”
Nationwide, a growing number of young adults raised in low-income households are attending college, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center study. Just under 40% of Georgetown students receive some amount of need-based financial aid, with the average grant covering $45,585 in fees, according to U.S. News.
As families gather resources to support returning students, students themselves have lost essential benefits offered by a college campus, Ladao wrote.  
“Georgetown may have been their source for mental health resources because it’s not available to them at home,” Ladao wrote. “Furthermore, especially as we are transitioning to virtual instruction, access to the internet—a necessity for the classroom—may be out of reach.”
Support from the university has been present but lagging, Ladao added. The initial March 11 email from the university announcing the transition to distance learning did not include specific resources for first-generation, low income students.
“From the student perspective, I feel that FGLI students, throughout the transition, have been treated as an afterthought,” Ladao wrote. “While some of these issues have finally been addressed in follow-up emails, the university ought to take this experience as a lesson for being more conscious and aware of low-income students at the very beginning. The emotional, physical and financial distress that tone-deaf university communications have caused is irreparable.”
Many elite universities were not designed to prioritize the needs of first-generation, low-income students, Craig said. 
“Institutions like Georgetown are not inherently created to support first-gen, low-income students and students of color,” Craig said. “Those efforts that do support those students take time to create and create integral change, but when you have a crisis like the pandemic, there isn’t time to create integral change because the university has to change things so often. There isn’t the time to create support for those students, and so we just kinda get left behind.”
The university has tried to take some steps to ease the financial burden of the transition. Georgetown teamed up with private storage providers to offer students discounts on storage, according to a March 15 email from Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Geoff Chatas. Two days later, Provost Robert Groves announced by email that the university would be covering the wages of student workers for the rest of the semester. 
Amid the turmoil, students have played a significant role in supporting one another. Craig’s friend offered to store her belongings at her home for free. Ladao has collaborated with other student activists to lobby the university for increased financial and academic accommodations for less privileged members of the community. Students have also compiled and circulated a 12-tab spreadsheet with lists of food, funding and other resources. 
Ladao said the willingness of students to support one another has persisted, despite the uncertainty of the situation. 
“It’s been wonderful to see students checking up on one another and ensuring that we’re all in this together,” Ladao said. “Nothing has been too big or too small to contribute to this grand effort to help one another.”
Seniors
The university’s decision to go digital seemed surreal at first, Samira Mehta (SFS ’20) said. 
“At the beginning, I think we were all a little stunned when the news came out. We were like, ‘This doesn’t seem necessary,’” Mehta said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
As the severity of the crisis became apparent, Mehta and many of her senior classmates were confronted with a difficult reality. The pandemic would take away the quintessential conclusion of their college careers, Mehta said.
“It was devastating to say goodbye to friends prematurely, to have to forgo senior spring and all of the events that that holds and to not quite get the closure to a major chapter in my life,” Mehta said. 
As the pandemic worsened in mid-March, U.S. health officials warned against hosting large gatherings. Many U.S. universities took further precautions by postponing or canceling their graduation ceremonies. 
Every May, graduating seniors gather with classmates, faculty and family at commencement to commemorate the achievements of the Georgetown senior class. For many, the ceremony is a momentous culmination of the college experience, Mehta said. 
“A lot of times commencement and the last couple of months give you that chance to reflect and really move through all that you’ve experienced here,” Mehta said. “Each day you move a little bit forward, and you don’t really feel yourself doing it. Even studying abroad, taking a class outside of your major — you just learn so much.” 
Over 1,000 students, parents and faculty signed a March 17 open letter to the university, encouraging the administration to postpone commencement instead of canceling it. 
On March 18, the university announced that it would postpone commencement activities to a time when community members could safely convene.
We’re all just a little devastated, but glad we have each other. – Samira Mehta (SFS’20)
Katrina Schmidt (SFS ’20), one of the letter’s original authors, said the lack of closure is one of the most painful consequences of the postponement. (Full disclosure: Schmidt formerly served as senior news editor for The Hoya). 
“I think in a university setting, it is really valuable, you know, when a lot of people are doing a lot of different things, where you can have those moments when you can all come together and recognize the shared experience that you had, and honor it and commemorate it,” Schmidt said in a video interview from her home in Baltimore. “I can lose senior ball, and I can lose the Tropaia ceremony. It doesn’t have to be Obama speaking at commencement, but I think there is a lot of value in, I think, properly honoring an experience.”
However disappointing the reality, Mehta recognized the necessity of the decision. 
“We understand that this is the right move by the university and it’s necessary,” Mehta said. “It was really, really comforting to see that they understand how much this means to us.”
The stress and unease of unsaid goodbyes are compounded by uncertainty in the world outside the campus gates, Mehta added. Graduating seniors are poised to enter an economy experiencing a recession, according to the International Monetary Fund. 
“A lot of students are worried about what next year is even going to look like. I think no one even knows when this is going to end because it is so unprecedented that it’s just a state of confusion and uncertainty,” Mehta said. 
Nevertheless, Georgetown seniors have found solace in solidarity, and many seniors are making up for graduation with less ceremonial moments of reflection. Mehta and Schmidt have managed to keep in touch with their classmates online.
Despite the challenges of losing senior spring, Mehta considers herself lucky. 
“Just knowing that we’re healthy and we have families to go back to I think is something that we’re really, really grateful for,” Mehta said. “We’re all just a little devastated, but glad we have each other.” 
Study Abroad 
The COVID-19 outbreak undid Nicole Ruggiero’s (SFS ’21) semester weeks before it upended life at Georgetown. Ruggiero, who is minoring in Italian, was studying abroad in Bologna, Italy, and found herself in the early throes of the COVID-19 crisis when she began her coursework at the beginning of February. 
Ruggiero and her peers shrugged off the early warning signs of disruption, she said. 
“I remember that when we first received the email from the University of Bologna that the university would not be having in-person lectures that week, most of us were like, ‘Okay that’s a precaution. We’ll be back to normal next week,’” Ruggiero said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “In fact, my friends and I booked a day trip to a town in northern Italy for the next day.”
As the crisis worsened, however, uncertainty began to set in, Ruggiero said. 
“Every 15 minutes or so there would be a public service announcement about the virus — about washing your hands, about looking out for symptoms — and everything just felt very off to me,” Ruggiero said, recalling a train trip. “Then by the time that they were saying that classes would be closed for a second week, I felt like we were just waiting to go home by that point.”
In late February, coronavirus cases in Italy surged to 400, and the death toll rose to 12, according to BBC. By the time the University of Bologna had organized an instructional continuity system online, Brown University, which ran Ruggiero’s program, had decided to pull the plug Feb. 29. Brown’s decision to cancel the program followed the Department of State’s travel warning encouraging Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to the country. 
It was a frenzy. – Nicole Ruggiero (SFS’21)
Georgetown had canceled its study abroad programs at Villa Le Balze in Florence, Italy, days earlier. The university also suspended all university-related travel to South Korea on Feb. 25 and to China on Jan. 28 because of mounting COVID-19 cases and fatalities. 
Ruggiero and her peers were initially angered by the cancellation, she said. 
“We still thought that this was being overly cautious. We thought that it wasn’t fair. We wanted to stay in Italy. We wanted to take the risk,” Ruggiero said. “And, I mean, if we had known what was going to happen, none of us would’ve wanted to stay, but at that point, we were just absolutely livid.” 
After digesting the severity of the situation, Ruggiero decided to return home. Coming home was no plain sailing process, she said. 
“I mean it was just hectic to pack and say goodbye to all of our friends, to tie things up with the program,” she recalled. “It was a frenzy.”
In accordance with the policy from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she self-quarantined for 14 days after her return to the United States.  
“I didn’t want to risk my parents getting it considering they’re members of a vulnerable population, so I had to take a taxi back,” Ruggiero said after her quarantine had ended. “My mom had left a pair of gloves and a mask outside for me and I just had to go upstairs to my bedroom without touching herself or even saying hello to her, and I stayed in here by myself for 14 days other than to go outside and shower.”
Georgetown officially recalled all of its students studying in the Schengen Area of Europe on March 12. Four days later, Georgetown suspended all of its study abroad programs. The university promised to work with students to manage reimbursement requests and help withdrawn students enroll in new classes, according to an email sent to study abroad students by Director of Global Education Craig Rinker. 
Over time, Ruggiero said she normalized the drastic shift in routine. 
“It was very tough, but like I said, by the end of it, it just becomes sort of routine and you develop a sense of a new normal and I just tried to keep in my head why I was doing it,” she said. “I do think that it just is going to be the responsibility of most of us right now to realize that this is our new reality and we’re going to have to take it on to protect our vulnerable populations, and I just thought a lot about my mom and my grandparents and that kept me in there and kept me going.”
Georgetown has helped study abroad students pay for flights and housing; however, a spokesperson did not directly state if the university would offer tuition refunds. 
“Georgetown is facilitating refunds to students for recoverable costs, like housing, from host programs. This is done as our partners are able to recover these costs on behalf of students,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown also provided financial support for repatriation costs (flight change fees, etc.) for our students abroad when they had to return to their permanent addresses at short notice.”
Many Georgetown students who have been pulled from their study abroad programs have also raised concerns about meeting their graduation requirements. Ruggiero and 48 other School of Foreign Service students penned a letter to SFS Dean Joel Hellman requesting greater flexibility with the 120-credit minimum requirement. The SFS requires that juniors and seniors take a minimum of 38 3-credit courses, but this requirement was cleared for sophomores and freshmen earlier this year. 
After the study abroad cancellations, the university created the GU Global Campus program, through which study abroad students can enroll in a special academic term titled Module C to fulfill their credit requirements for the semester. One hundred students have signed up for the program, which runs online from March 30 until June 12, according to a university spokesperson. 
Other study abroad programs continued their classes online. Ruggiero was able to continue her studies at the University of Bologna through a customized set of courses, she says. 
Ruggiero does not fault the university for its brisk response. The university, however, could have taken more steps to support students returning from abroad, she said. 
“I do think that Georgetown can and should do better in reaching out,” Ruggiero said. “If they’re going to make such a sweeping and difficult decision for students, they need to be more available to us.”
International Students
After Georgetown converted to online classes, Elliot Mack (SFS ’22) did not join the mass exodus of students leaving campus. In fact, he had no choice but to stay. 
“I am half-French, half-American. My parents live in Istanbul, Turkey,” Mack said in a video interview with The Hoya. “I do not have a residency permit anymore to live in Turkey because it expired one year after I left for college, so I cannot go back there since they’re not accepting tourists, especially French nationals. And even if they were, I would have to spend two weeks in quarantine in basically the middle of Turkey in these empty facilities, which obviously would impede strongly on my academic work.”
Though Mack is a U.S. citizen, he has no home base in the country, he said. 
“Although I’m a U.S. citizen, I do not have a U.S. permanent residency,” Mack said. “I don’t have really any other viable options in the U.S. that are feasible and not with immunocompromised people or that are not stressful situations.” 
Mack opted to stay on campus because of these complex circumstances, joining approximately 174 other undergraduate students who have not been able to return home, according to a March 30 universitywide email from Groves. After applying to stay on campus, Mack now lives with a roommate in a Village A apartment. 
Mack is one of 488 international undergraduate students attending Georgetown. International students have encountered unique obstacles adjusting to pandemic college life. Some are stranded in the United States away from their families, while others struggle to adjust back home. 
Ryan Kim (MSB ’22), a native of Seoul, South Korea, was also unable to return to his family. 
“Since my home country, South Korea, currently has a high infection rate, my parents and I decided I should stay here,” Kim said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I’m the only one here. All my family is in Korea. Fortunately, they are all safe and healthy.”
Students who wished to remain on campus had to fill out a form with the Office of Residential Living before March 17 to receive permission from the university to continue living in university-owned housing, according to an FAQ page on the university’s website.
Kim applied to live on campus, completing the required university survey. An anxious, class-packed week passed before his application was approved. 
“It’s been a very tough and challenging experience for me,” Kim said before getting his decision. “I was relieved at the same time because school did still give me the opportunity to stay here. But at the same time, I wish they could inform me earlier so that I don’t have to wait until this Friday.”  
Mack’s journey was more complicated. His initial application to stay on campus was denied. The university did not specify why, according to Mack. Mack was able to secure his on-campus housing only after numerous email follow-ups and the intervention of a faculty member. The university’s process for housing allocation was mechanical and inflexible, Mack said.
“First of all, it’s impersonal. And second of all, it’s like they know better than you when, realistically, they don’t know what your situation is,” Mack said. “It just feels like they don’t trust students to think through things and make the best decisions for themselves.” 
The struggle for housing was frustrating and isolating, he added. 
“I’m already alone in my apartment, and it’s weird that I have to fight to stay alone in my apartment. It doesn’t seem like an ideal situation and I don’t know why I’m fighting for a non-ideal situation, but it’s the best I got,” Mack said. “I was alone in it, and it took me so much energy — just personal will and energy — to change my situation.”
The university has considered every on-campus housing request carefully, even giving students the ability to explain their rationale for staying directly to administrators, according to a university spokesperson. 
I’m sleeping when they’re awake, and I’m awake when they’re about to go to bed. That’s the worst part. – Muhammad Ahsan Shafique (SFS’22)
“Each application was thoughtfully reviewed, and all students who asked to speak on their situation confidentially were reached out to by university staff,” the university spokesperson wrote.
Despite this practice, the university’s response to housing requests and to the crisis more broadly has lacked student input, Mack said.
“I think that they’ve been doing great at talking amongst themselves and organizing, but I don’t understand why there are not students in the rooms when they’re making these decisions,” Mack said. “Nobody knows better than we do what we need right now.” 
As some international students struggle to find accommodation in the United States, others are straining to recreate campus life at home.  
Muhammad Ahsan Shafique (SFS ’22) lives in Pakistan. When news of the university’s decision broke, his family ordered him to return home. Because of the nine-hour time difference, he now takes his classes at night and sleeps during the day. The routine is grueling, Shafique said. 
“There are so many problems with me coming here,” Shafique said in a video interview with The Hoya. “My sleep schedule is a mess. I go to bed at nine in the morning to noon, something like that, and I wake up between six and eight. So I’m basically on Eastern Time.” 
Though his professors have been very supportive, Shafique has struggled to manage the shift. 
“My body doesn’t let me concentrate, so I can’t do a lot of work. And, as you can imagine, I can’t socialize with my family,” he said. “I’m sleeping when they’re awake, and I’m awake when they’re about to go to bed. That’s the worst part.”  
Spotty internet and a deteriorating health crisis in Pakistan is compounding the stress. 
“It’s been pretty bad,” Shafique sighed.

Are there any places (study spaces, classrooms, dining places) still open at school?

I had wanted to return to campus for the rest of the semester, but I have no idea how the conditions are at school.

Georgetown University has canceled fall study abroad programs set to begin before August 1 to conform with previous university restrictions on international summer travel, according to an email sent to all fall and full-year study abroad students.
The university suspended all of its summer study abroad programs March 25 because of concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. The latest cancellation, announced April 13, will largely affect programs located in the Southern Hemisphere, where fall academic semesters are slated to begin in July. Fall programs beginning after August 1 have not yet been canceled. Administrators will decide the fate of the remaining fall programs by May 29, according to an email from Office of Global Education Director Craig Rinker, who notified study abroad students of the cancellation. 
The cancellation applied to 12 study abroad programs with a total of nearly 50 participating students, Rinker wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
If students from canceled programs still want to spend time abroad, they can try to enroll in other fall programs that begin at later dates or postpone their study abroad plans until the spring 2021 semester, according to the email. Rinker also encouraged students still enrolled in fall study abroad programs to register for main campus classes and apply for on-campus housing in case the other fall programs are canceled. 
The university began canceling study abroad programs in late January as COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, raged through China and began spreading across the globe. After ending spring programs in different global hotspots of the virus, Georgetown decided to suspend all study abroad programs for the spring semester March 16. 
Grant Brown (COL ’22) is one among the latest round of students who had their study abroad plans derailed by the pandemic. (Full disclosure: Brown serves as a staff writer for The Guide.) Brown was set to travel to Valparaíso, Chile, in late July before he received news of the cancellation Monday morning. The cancellation, while disappointing, was expected, Brown said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
“I was anticipating it, but the only reason why is because me and my friends were talking. We were all talking about how we think that study abroad will be canceled,” Brown said. 
The university’s decision to specifically cancel programs beginning before August seemed arbitrary, Brown added. 
“With mine I would have only been abroad for one week of July, so it doesn’t really make sense to me why they only canceled those programs,” Brown said. “It seems like they’re just kind of delaying their decision to actually cancel all abroad programs for now,” Brown said. 
This article will be updated as the story develops.

The Democratic and Republican National Committee chairs remained hopeful that their parties can overcome disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during virtual events in April. 
The events came as the primary season for the 2020 general election has nearly concluded, with former Vice President Joe Biden (D) presumptively running against incumbent President Donald Trump (R) in November. 
Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) first talked with DNC Chair Tom Perez on April 20 and later with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel on April 22. The conversations were conducted over Zoom, and members of the Georgetown University community were able to tune into the conference and ask questions during the latter half of each broadcast. 
During the Democratic primary campaign, the DNC prioritized building party unity heading into the general election, according to Perez.
“Our goal is to make sure that everyone got a fair shake because we want to make sure that we come out of our Democratic primary united,” Perez said. “And what I’m proud of is every single candidate has issued a full-throated endorsement to the vice president. I’m really excited about that. What we’re doing is leading with their values.”
The Republican Party, however, is well-prepared financially and benefits from an existing campaign infrastructure, according to McDaniel.
“Clearly, we’ve had a head start. We’ve raised record money. We’ve had an ability to work with the Trump campaign. We’re in 23 states already with 800 staff on the ground, and we’ve activated about a million volunteers,” McDaniel said. “We build the roads so that candidates can drive on it. And that road takes years and years and years to build, and we’re in the best place we’ve ever been heading into this election.”
The two-part series, titled “Election 2020: A Chat with the Chairs,” was hosted by GU Politics in coordination with the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition, Georgetown University College Democrats and Georgetown University College Republicans. GU Politics also streamed the conversation live on its Facebook page and YouTube channel.
Regardless of existing infrastructure, traditional election strategies could not be implemented this year because of the pandemic, according to The New York Times. Both parties have had to forgo public events, with Biden turning to video speeches and Trump making do with press conferences instead of rallies. 
Despite the present obstacles to organization, McDaniel said stay-at-home orders allow for unprecedented personal check-ins with voters.
“Everyone’s home, so they’re responding, and they want to talk more. It is an interesting shift, but I don’t feel we’ve lost any ground,” McDaniel said. “Instead of knocking on that door, I’m knocking on your Zoom, I’m knocking on your email. We just want to check on you: ‘Are you doing OK? Can we give you the resources you need?’ That’s where the whole country was, and so we wanted to just make it more of a check-in.”
Perez pointed to the recent primary held April 7 in Wisconsin as an example of how the Democratic party can succeed despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. The state Supreme Court, which has a Republican majority, blocked Gov. Tony Evers’ (D) order to postpone the election, and the U.S. Supreme Court blocked an absentee ballot deadline extension in what was condemned by left voices and election experts as an attempt at voter suppression, as voters wary of COVID-19 may have avoided the polls. 
Regardless of the pandemic, turnout remained high at 34%, comparable to previous presidential election cycles in 2008 and 2012, although lower than in 2016, according to NPR. Biden won the state’s Democratic primary with 63% of the vote, and a Democrat-backed judge was elected to the state Supreme Court. 
Perez took a partisan stance and said the election results from Wisconsin prove Democrats can successfully organize voters despite unforeseen obstacles, both biological and political.
“We tried hard to get Republicans to postpone it, but they saw an opportunity to suppress the vote and win an election in Milwaukee and in Wisconsin for this critically important state Supreme Court case,” Perez said. “We know how to organize in the middle of a pandemic. They tried to suppress the vote and we were able to stop that. And most importantly, voters are motivated.”
One of the biggest motivating factors may be the economy, as unemployment has skyrocketed to 14.7% because of the pandemic, according to FiveThirtyEight. Focusing on the economic consequences of the pandemic, McDaniel said that voters will choose who they trust the most to rebuild the economy and that Trump is best positioned to do so.
“The president built an economy that was in such great shape as we headed into this unforeseen crisis: 7 million new jobs, 500,000 manufacturing jobs. This was a president that immediately understood as a candidate the threat that China posed in terms of our supply chain,” McDaniel said. “Americans still, even against Joe Biden head-to-head, trust the president on the economy and to build back the economy at a higher level.”
Perez, however, said the pandemic response from the president pales in comparison to the precautions taken by the Democrats, including pushing back the Democratic National Convention from mid-July to Aug. 17, according to The New York Times. 
“We’re always planning and hoping for the best, but we’re planning for every contingency, and that is what preparedness is about. Unfortunately, the president has not gotten the memo, and we are paying dire consequences for that,” Perez said. “We will nominate our standard-bearer, and in the meantime, we are organized everywhere.”

The COVID-19 pandemic is a stark reminder of the challenges posed by globalization, waning U.S. leadership and the ineptitude of the Trump administration, Senator Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said in a virtual event April 28. 
The conversation, titled “American Leadership During Times of Crisis: A Conversation with Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah),” was hosted over Zoom by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and co-sponsored by Georgetown University College Republicans and the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition. GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94) moderated the event, which centered on the challenges facing policymakers in a global health crisis.
While the Trump administration should be criticized for the United States’ lack of personal protective equipment and testing for COVID-19, the country’s unpreparedness also stems from the long-term diminishing influence of U.S. foreign policy, according to Romney.
“That first phase was not one that will stand out as being a great moment in American leadership,” Romney said. “I think the world was a bit surprised by that because they think of us as being the nation that first went to the moon, that has accomplished extraordinary things in the new economy, and yet when it came to PPE, when it came to testing and just the speed of our response, it looked slow.”
As the coronavirus rapidly spread in early March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially said healthy people should not wear masks to ensure health care workers had adequate supplies. Panic buying still caused a shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment, however. China is one of the leading global suppliers of personal protective equipment, but strained diplomatic relations and the presence of products that were not Food and Drug Administration certified on the market prevented hospitals from receiving shipments quickly, according to Vice News.
The senator said an overreliance on Chinese manufacturers’ medical supplies played a role in the botched response, reiterating his April 23 op-ed in The Washington Post warning U.S. politicians of China’s growing influence.
“We really have let China get a hold of our industries that are key to our health care, but that’s also true across our economies,” Romney said. “Because of that, I think there’s a wake up potential right now to say, ‘Wait a second. How far are we gonna let China go?’ before we say, ‘Hey, you gotta play by the same rules everyone else plays by.’”
The aftermath of the pandemic will be a critical time for U.S. leaders to strengthen their partnership with allies and assert leadership in the global order, according to Romney.
“If we collectively come together, I bet we can dissuade China from the course they’re on. If, instead, we all focus internally and only think about our domestic policies,” Romney said, “we will have missed an opportunity to create the leverage we need to make China play by the rules.”
On the domestic front, Romney said policymakers should pursue a balanced approach between federal and state regulations. As of May 2, 97% of the U.S. population is currently under a stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order, according to CNN. While Trump claimed many states could have reopened by May 1 and shared federal guidelines with governors, individual states are responsible for making their own plans to restart their economies.
While the decision to reopen businesses is made by state and local governments, other parts of the response, like ventilator production and distribution, should be managed at the federal level, according to Romney. He said the federal government did not exercise enough power.
“Were it up to me, I would have a far more centralized coordination effort,” Romney said. “I think it’s important for the people at the top to recognize there are always people out there with more information. You want to bring them in, divide the responsibilities and manage them.”
When peak infection rates begin to decline, the United States should not only focus on rebuilding the economy but also look to provide leadership in disease prevention efforts, according to Romney.
“I think we have the potential to stand out in a positive way in the recovery area, and I would suggest the development of treatments and vaccines. That kind of research work is going on around the world,” Romney said. “We may not be first, but there is certainly a lot going on here that’s not going on in a lot of places, and we may well be able to lead in that area.”
If the Trump administration’s recovery effort outshines its initial response to COVID-19, the president may still win reelection, according to Romney. He spoke in response to one student’s question about the presidential election in November.
“I think it is likely the incumbent will win,” he said.“I think it’s likely that the economy will be doing better than we’re feeling right now. We’re near a down now. It’ll probably be heading back up by November, and that will augur to the advantage of the incumbent.”

Georgetown University international students are reckoning with a new phase of uncertainty after the Department of Homeland Security introduced new regulations Monday limiting international students’ ability to live and study in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Students on M-1 or F-1 visas studying at institutions that only offer online instruction for the fall 2020 semester are required to leave the country or transfer to an institution that offers in-person courses, according to new federal guidelines published by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on July 6. The guidelines allow students on F-1 visas to take a hybrid course load — consisting of in-person and virtual classes — so long as universities certify students are taking the minimum number of online courses to “make normal progress” in their degree. 
Currently, 3,147 international students are enrolled at Georgetown either with an F-1 or J-1 visa, and the school’s hybrid reopening plan does not make immediately clear whether F-1 students will be able to remain in the United States.
The new risk of deportation for international students at Georgetown has prompted confusion and anxiety among international students living in the United States, launching their already uncertain fall plans into further jeopardy. 
Murphy Lu (COL ’21) was unable to return to her home country of China when classes moved online in March because of a series of travel restrictions. She planned on residing on campus in the fall. Since DHS’s announcement, however, Lu and her family have scrambled to find potential flights out of the country.
“We’ve been trying to find flights that have a stopover in Europe or somewhere or in Ethiopia because we heard that those tickets are easier to find on the market,” Lu said in an interview with The Hoya. “As the saying goes, ‘As long as we can get a ticket of which the destination is a city in China, it doesn’t matter where it departs.’ We’re that desperate.” 
Lu fears many of the classes she must take to graduate may not be offered in an in-person format. 
“I do have to make another plan if I can’t find a ticket to go back home. In that case, I would have to register for an in-person class in order to legally stay in this country, but I’m not sure if any of the courses that I have to take to graduate offers in-person class,” Lu said in an interview with The Hoya. “If it doesn’t, I would have to figure out how to register for one, but that’s tricky. Because what if I don’t need that class to graduate? I would have to waste almost $10,000 on that and I don’t think that’s fair for us.”
Though the Trump administration has implemented numerous policies detrimental to international students, the latest DHS guidance is especially unforgiving, according to Lu.   
“I think it’s a little bit too harsh given that they don’t really consider our situations. It’s not like it’s our choice to stay,” Lu said. “It’s more like we have to stay because we can’t find a way to leave.”
In response to the new DHS guidelines, Georgetown students began circulating a petition demanding the university immediately take action to protect its international students. The petition has garnered 1,759 signatures from faculty, students and organizations at time of publication.
The petition requested that the university provide sufficient in-person classes for those students at risk of deportation and a school-backed response condemning the ICE guidelines, among other requests. The university is morally obligated to support its international students, according to petitioners.
“This cruel move has no legitimate basis in public health or national security, and is solely designed to target international students who are peacefully contributing to their campus communities,” the petition reads. “Georgetown has a moral obligation to its students and community to legally work around the new ICE rules in whatever ways possible.”
International students also drafted an open letter currently with 113 student signatures advocating for similar protections, including maintaining students’ F-1 visa status during online learning. Students currently living outside of the U.S. may face challenges in returning to the country to maintain that visa status, according to Wendy Xia (SFS ’22), who helped draft the letter.
“Since Georgetown has announced a hybrid model (though the definition of that is unclear), internationals in their home countries (or a third country) could be forced to return to the US to maintain their F-1 status,” she wrote in a message to The Hoya. “We need more clarity on so many fronts, including support for the majority of internationals, who have been in the dark since they boarded a flight home.”
University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) announced July 8 that Georgetown would join other universities in submitting an amicus brief in federal court protesting the DHS guidance. Georgetown’s undergraduate and graduate programs are working to increase the number of in-person course offerings to help international students satisfy their visa  requirements, DeGioia added. 
“Our University strongly opposes this reckless action. It creates new and unnecessary barriers for international students and puts their health, stability, and academic progress at risk if they are unable to participate in classes in-person,” DeGioia wrote in an email to students. “The new requirements fail to recognize the invaluable contributions of our international students within our community and the impacts of this abrupt change during an ongoing pandemic.”
Faculty in the School of Foreign Service plan to offer in-person class options to all eligible undergraduate and graduate international students so they can maintain their visa status, SFS Dean Joel Hellman wrote in an email to students. 
Lise Howard, an associate professor of government and international relations, tweeted that she would hold in-person classes that fulfill the new on-campus requirements for international students in the fall semester. Howard said she wanted to support her international students in part because of her own experiences studying abroad.
“I benefited from study abroad programs in seven different countries when I was a student,” Howard wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is only reasonable that even under conditions of COVID, the United States would welcome and protect foreign students as a matter of solidarity in these hard times, and in order to ensure that American students will continue to have the opportunity of studying abroad in the future.”
Howard believes that the university will support her plan to create a small class and said she and other teachers are working with the university to officially create new classes.
”It goes without saying that foreign students, researchers, and faculty enrich the learning and research environment in the U.S.,” Howard wrote. “Many of us [faculty] have agreed to do whatever we can to ensure continuity of learning for all of our students, and we fully expect university support.”
After graduating, Lu planned on working in the United States, a country she had once admired for its power and influence in the world. After observing the government’s jumbled pandemic response and hostile attitude towards international students, Lu feels like she must reevaluate her next steps. 
“Since my home country doesn’t welcome me and America doesn’t seem to have a control of what is going on, I really want to take my career somewhere else and probably move to somewhere else,” Lu said. “[The U.S.] is a country that only cares about itself and it’s not what I envisioned as the greatest country to be. If that’s the direction this country is going to, I probably have to reevaluate my future plans.”

Understanding and distributing updated and objective information is crucial during crises, former White House chiefs of staff said in a virtual roundtable. 
The conversation focused in particular on the COVID-19 pandemic and how President Donald Trump’s administration has approached the crisis. Mick Mulvaney (SFS ’89) spoke about his time advising Trump in the early stages of the pandemic, and the rest of the panel told stories from their own experiences serving in the White House.
The event, titled “How Presidents Deal With Crisis: A Conversation With White House Chiefs Of Staff,” was hosted on Zoom and broadcast July 28 by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. Speaking with GU Politics Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94), former chiefs of staff Mack McLarty, Andrew Card, Denis McDonough (GRD ’96) and Mulvaney elaborated on the role of the White House chief of staff in managing global crises in U.S. history.
Mulvaney, who served as acting chief of staff from January 2019 to March 2020, stressed that taking action requires truthful information, citing his experience advising Trump during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. 
Although other national crises have demanded immediate action, the lack of information surrounding the coronavirus diminished the apparent danger, according to Mulvaney. Once the administration gained information that carriers of the disease could transmit the virus without showing symptoms, it had to adjust. 
“That’s the one takeaway that I remember from that crisis, was that it was a slow, sort of simmering thing,” Mulvaney said. “We were operating with bad information about what the disease was, and we got that one piece of information that had to change the way we were dealing with the crisis.”
Mulvaney also shifted blame to China, saying their lack of transparency contributed to the United States’ own inert response.
“When we watched what was happening in China, and we knew it was a coronavirus, we didn’t know much more about it than that,” Mulvaney said. “Keep in mind, the Chinese were not sharing information with us at that time. In fact, in hindsight, we didn’t have a lot of good information about this virus until late February by the time it got to Italy.”
Card, who served as chief of staff from 2001 to 2006, explained that, in time-sensitive and high-pressure situations, the president depends on the chief of staff to communicate the right information.
“You’re dealing with crises all the time, but having a sense that you know that you need good information is kind of the chief of staff’s job — to reinforce the need for people not to present information that they are not certain about,” Card said. 
The White House chief of staff serves as the president’s assistant and is a cabinet-level official. The president appoints their own chief of staff without needing for a Senate confirmation. The chief of staff’s duties might include managing White House staff, controlling the information and the people seen by the president, advising the president and generally advancing the president’s agenda outside of the executive branch. For Card, the duty of the chief of staff is to aid the president in making informed decisions, not to confirm the president’s preconceived notions.
“Your job is not to try and please the president,” Card said. “You have to help the president and suffer the consequences if the pleasure disappears.”
Consistent communication is also important in maintaining the nation’s trust, according to McDonough, who served as President Barack Obama’s chief of staff from 2013 to 2017.
“As Andy [Card] has just said, information is gonna change,” McDonough said. “And you have to maintain your credibility with the American people to trust what you say, even when the best available information changes. Around Ebola, for example, we would have a very regular briefing led by the medical professionals so that they could give directly to the American people the best available information informed by science.”
Card urged listeners to seek differences of opinion because a well-informed decision is a well-debated decision.
“In making that right decision, understand that you can’t do it alone,” he said. “And if you’re making a decision by yourself, chances are people will stop following you pretty soon. And don’t just ask an echo chamber to bounce back to you what you’ve already said. Make sure there are contrarians or people who will challenge you in the group.”

Jeffrey Ngo is a leading activist in Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and a doctoral student at Georgetown University studying history. This feature is the first in a series of in-depth profiles about Georgetown students and their stories. 
Jeffrey Ngo’s career as an activist began in 2003, when he was seven. 
At the time, his home city of Hong Kong was navigating a period of turbulence. The SARS outbreak had spread across much of Southeast Asia, killing close to 300 Hong Kongers and infecting nearly 2,000. Only weeks after the health crisis began to subside, Hong Kong plunged into a political one.
On July 1, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators packed the plazas and throughways surrounding Hong Kong’s government headquarters to protest a newly introduced national security law. Laden with vague language and sweeping edicts, the law prohibited secession and sedition against the Chinese government, threatening the long tradition of civil liberties enjoyed by the city’s residents. 
In 1997, the United Kingdom transferred control of Hong Kong to China. Part of the handover agreement between the two powers stipulated Hong Kong retain a level of autonomy and freedom until 2047 under a one country, two systems model. 
Ngo recalls Hong Kongers’ sharing a cautious optimism after the handover. 
“There was a sense that Hong Kong would not only attain democracy but be the guiding light for democratic change in the rest of China,” Ngo said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It was still possible to see a Hong Kong government led by a Hong Konger and somewhat responsive to public opinion.”
Not everyone shared this idealism. For some, the handover was Hong Kong’s death knell — a powerful, ascendant China bent on expanding party control would gradually erode Hong Kong’s democratic institutions and civil liberties well before 2047, and no one would stop it. 
“There was a lot of talk about [the handover] being Hong Kong’s endgame,” Ngo said. “But the first five, six years sort of proved that wrong.”
During the summer of 2003, half a million Hong Kongers fended off Beijing’s first major incursion. 
Ngo remembers the day well despite his young age. He attended the protest with his family, who guided him through the throngs of protesters. The sweltering, subtropical heat beat down on the crowds, which seemed unending. He remembered the anger and pride of his fellow Hong Kongers — it was Ngo’s first taste of what he calls “the struggle.” The demonstrations awakened him to Hong Kong’s existential battle to protect its freedom, inspiring him to join a fight to which he would dedicate his life. 
The Emissary 
Ngo was born two years before Hong Kong’s handover to China. He lived out his childhood in a high-rise apartment in the district of Shatin, a residential neighborhood nestled between parks and nature reserves. 
Ngo was born into a middle-class family with a strong Hong Kong identity. His father, now retired, was a longtime professor at a local university. Like many other middle-class families in Hong Kong, Ngo’s family was firmly pro-democracy. His parents served as his gateway into the struggle.  
Ngo immersed himself in Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement after 2003. He began following the news attentively in grade school, in the same way many of his peers might have tuned into Sunday morning cartoons. 
By secondary school, he became a regular on the pro-democracy protest circuit, participating in street rallies and marches across the city. 
“Most of my classmates were more detached from the local political scene,” he remarked. 
Every year on the fourth night of June, Ngo gathered with hundreds of Hong Kongers at Victoria Park, candle in hand, to commemorate the anniversary of the Chinese government’s bloody crackdown against pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989. According to Ngo, the episode has special salience for Hong Kongers, who are fighting to preserve the liberties Tiananmen’s victims had fought for, but failed to acquire. 
In 2013, Ngo moved to New York City to study journalism at New York University. He hoped to become a political journalist, documenting the developments in his city and holding its politicians to account. 
Ngo enjoyed his time in New York. The city reminded him of home — dense, diverse and dynamic. The local obsession with football, however, was one cultural rift he found difficult to cross. 
He made friends and did well in his classes. His interest in politics led him to spend a semester at NYU’s campus in Washington, D.C., his sophomore year. 
That semester, he began to lose his interest in journalism. For one, the market for a journalism internship was unforgiving. (“It’s stupid because if you want an internship you need experience, but if you never get an internship in the first place, you can’t get experience,” he griped.)
He also grew wary of journalism’s shortsightedness.  
“Obviously journalism has a lot of value, but most of the time it doesn’t allow you to go very deep into things. The attention span is relatively short, and there is a lot of pressure to deal with a lot at the same time,” he said. “If I wanted to understand Hong Kong’s problems, I needed to take a longer view.”  
And so, he switched to history. His academic switch, like many of the major changes of his life, was inspired by a new round of political upheaval in Hong Kong. 
In late August 2014, the Chinese government introduced an electoral rule requiring that candidates for the Hong Kong chief executive be prescreened by the Chinese Communist Party. The new regulations represented an undisguised assault on Hong Kong’s democratic practices and rule of law. 
“Whoever wins [the election] is someone Beijing is already fine with,” Ngo explained. “People were outraged — this is crazy, this is not democracy. This is what happens in Iran.”
Protests exploded in September, with tens of thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets. Ngo observed these developments from afar and decided to take action. He began organizing protests in D.C. and New York. Every Thursday night throughout the fall, he took the overnight Greyhound bus to New York to organize protests and marches over the weekend.
“I would meet people and host smaller rallies [in New York],” Ngo said. “On weekdays I would come back to D.C. for my internship and my classes.”
For the first time, Ngo was no longer just a participant, but an organizer, and a notable one. He caught the attention of protest leaders in Hong Kong and U.S. lawmakers. He became friends with Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, two prominent pro-democracy advocates who, with Ngo, would be key leaders of subsequent protests in Hong Kong. That same year, Ngo had his first meeting with a member of Congress — now-retired Frank Wolf (LAW ’65) (R) of Virginia’s 10th district. 
By December, however, the protests petered out. Nothing had changed. The government, unmoved by the demonstrations, kept the electoral changes in place and began undermining academic freedoms. 
“There was still the hope that if we staged an unprecedented protest — one of the largest protests on Chinese soil since 1989 — maybe Beijing would budge,” Ngo said. “It didn’t.”
The defeat shook Ngo and many pro-democracy Hong Kongers, who were forced to reckon with the feasibility and sustainability of the one country, two systems model. 
“In 2014, there was still hope that one country, two systems could work,” Ngo said. “In 2015, there was a lot of soul-searching.”
Ngo’s activism during the protests, however fruitless in the short term, launched him to the forefront of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy political scene. In 2016, Ngo helped Law get elected to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, the city’s lawmaking body. The following year, Ngo undertook the duty of internationalizing Hong Kong’s cause by lobbying foreign lawmakers, writing op-eds and speaking at events. In due time, Ngo would soon face his biggest challenge. 
Slipping
Ngo spoke with The Hoya via Zoom from his apartment in D.C. He started his doctoral degree in history at Georgetown in 2018 after finishing his master’s degree at NYU. 
He sat in a swivel chair in front of a russet bookshelf that reached from the floor to the ceiling. The shelf was packed with books about history and politics. Books that were not afforded space on the shelf formed small, cluttered mounds in front of it. Ngo filled the remaining slivers of space on the shelf with knick knacks, photos with congressmembers and dignitaries and other personal mementos. 
He sported a green T-shirt, wide, ovular glasses and an unruly pandemic haircut. Throughout the conversation, Ngo worked his way through a bowl of microwaved soup, taking breaks from his lengthy and detailed answers to take a sip or two. 
One year before his conversation with The Hoya, Ngo was choking on tear gas on the streets of Hong Kong. 
In the summer of 2019, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers mobilized on the streets against another perceived attack on their civil liberties. This time, the threat took the form of an extradition bill put forth in the Hong Kong legislature, which would, under unclear pretenses, allow Hong Kongers to be extradited to China for a variety of crimes. The extradition bill was, at the time, the gravest threat to Hong Kong democracy, according to Ngo. 
“It was an existential threat. The idea about what separates Hong Kong from China is the rule of law and judicial independence. A lot of that was going to disappear if the extradition bill passed,” he said. “In 2019, the feeling was that we were trying to defend what we always had, and we were trying to prevent that from slipping.” 
Ngo spent every day that summer on the streets protesting. He and a cohort of friends from the pro-democracy party Demosisto assembled one of the city’s first rallies against the extradition law. He lobbied members of Congress, helping organize hearings and legislative action. 
The protests became more dire and more violent as the summer progressed. Police used beatings, tear gas, and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. Protestors armed themselves with makeshift shields and umbrellas for defense. 
“It was really something,” Ngo said, pausing and combing his hair with his hand, “being on the streets and getting tear-gassed and seeing how Hong Kongers fight back.” 
As the protests evolved, so did the demands of the protesters. The government had to do more than withdraw the extradition bill to win back their trust and keep them off the streets. Protesters issued four new requests, including an independent investigation into police brutality and expanded electoral rights. The government dropped the extradition bill in September, but the other demands were not met. The protests puttered along throughout the following months. 
The protests began to wane in the spring as the COVID-19 pandemic made landfall in Hong Kong. Police forces used the pandemic as a pretext for disbanding gatherings. Throughout the late spring and early summer, the protests teetered. In late June, they collapsed.  
On June 30, the Chinese government passed a new national security law in response to ongoing instability in the city. The law, harsher than its 2003 predecessor, is an open-ended prohibition of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers against the Chinese government. 
The law’s broad and vague terms make it a potent weapon against Hong Kong’s democratic institutions. 
“It’s very open to interpretation and very open to abuse,” Ngo said. 
The law flipped a switch. The protests mellowed, and the streets emptied. Once-vocal critics of the Chinese government quieted down. The new law effectively quashed the pro-democracy protests, eroding Hong Kongers’ civil liberties in the process.   
“A number of [pro-democracy] groups have either suspended their operations officially or disbanded in Hong Kong,” Ngo remarked. “The situation on the ground changed very rapidly.”  
The Long View 
Ngo has no plan to return to Hong Kong after the passage of the national security law. His pro-democracy activism and vocal opposition to the Chinese regime make him a prime target for security forces, who have swiftly and forcefully disarmed dissent in the city. If he were to return, Ngo fears he would be detained upon arrival. 
“It would not be safe for me to [return],” Ngo said. “The situation on the ground in Hong Kong is pretty grim. My friends are getting arrested and prosecuted. They’re worried.” 
Hong Kong authorities have been conducting mass arrests since the law’s passage in late June. Many of Ngo’s friends and colleagues have already been seized or forced abroad. Law was forced to flee the city in early July. Agnes Chow, another well-known Hong Kong activist, was detained by police Aug. 10 for allegedly “inciting secession,” the same day authorities arrested the owner of a notable pro-democracy newspaper. 
Within the span of a summer, civil disobedience in Hong Kong was extinguished. The city’s civil liberties — everything Hong Kongers had been fighting to preserve since 1997 — have been buried, its independence curtailed.
Despite Hong Kong’s new bleak reality, Ngo is holding onto some hope. He believes the United States and other global powers are invested in protecting Hong Kong from an overbearing Beijing. To be hard on China has become politically savvy, and Ngo expects U.S. politicians to fight Chinese expansion on all fronts, including in Hong Kong. People, he says, need to consider the long view.
“There are larger structural forces at work that create a more favorable international situation for the Hong Kong cause,” Ngo said. “When I first started, it was so hard to get anyone interested in Hong Kong.”
Since the passage of the national security law, Ngo has continued advocating for Hong Kong from D.C., lobbying lawmakers, posting on social media and continuing his research. 
“If you take the long view, it is hard to make a case that what I’m doing is not helpful to Hong Kong. This is what I tell myself,” he said. “That’s why I will keep doing what I do.” 
Ngo’s hope for the future, however lofty it may appear, is undergirded by a more universal worldview. Life for Ngo is a sequence of serendipitous moments. Nothing is fixed, and everything — preferences, politics, power — can be changed by those who will it or the circumstances around them. Perhaps the only certainty, Ngo believes, is that society always edges toward justice. 
“I would say I’m an optimist, not a naive one. I just believe that history moves generally towards more humanity,” he said, pausing and staring down at his soup. He looked up and grinned, “You know what I mean.”

Some Georgetown University professors teaching classes about China are taking precautionary measures to protect students and faculty from possible security threats during online learning in the fall. 
Some faculty worry lecture recordings and other technical vulnerabilities in Zoom may endanger students and instructors who criticize the Chinese government. Faculty who spoke with The Hoya are particularly concerned some sensitive course material may violate the broad and vague stipulations of the latest Chinese national security law. The law, enacted by the Chinese government June 30 in response to ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, is an open-ended prohibition of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign powers against the Chinese government. 
James Millward, a professor of Chinese and Central Asian history, said because the crimes are vaguely defined, the scope of the new law’s impact on foreign nationals is still unclear.
“If you read the text of the National Security Law, it is very broad and virtually any US-taught class dealing with contemporary China will have material that the CCP could, if it wished, call subversive or separatist—which could have very severe consequences for a student found with such things on their laptop, or downloading a video of a class with such content from a Canvas or Panopto server,” Millward wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In the past, the Chinese Communist Party has taken punitive action against Chinese students who have voiced anti-regime opinions while studying abroad. In November 2019, a Chinese student studying at the University of Minnesota was sentenced to six months in prison in China for tweets he had posted while abroad.  
Kristen Looney, an assistant professor of Asian studies and government who is teaching a “Politics of China” course this semester, said she adapted her syllabi to reflect the newfound risks that come from virtual learning.
“I think every faculty teaching courses on China should notify students of the risks, so I just put a section about online meeting policies on my syllabi,” Looney said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Millward said he became alarmed about Georgetown using the Zoom video conferencing software for the upcoming virtual semester without properly educating faculty about the privacy issues that may arise from it. Millward and other Asian studies professors across the country penned a statement in July calling on universities to adopt safer online learning practices. 
Millward said the habit of recording lectures has undermined efforts by Zoom and administrators to secure communications on the platform and protect users.
“The university administrations imagine, ‘Oh, we just record everything on Zoom and then send it to them or record everything on Zoom and it stays in the cloud on Canvas and then they can go download it whenever,’” Millward said in a follow-up interview with The Hoya. “The problem with that is that, although Zoom is now theoretically end-to-end encrypted, once it’s stored somewhere and then you’re downloading it as a file, that file’s on your computer. And it’s also no longer encrypted, and so then it becomes something that anybody can look at.”
Looney said because of the sensitive nature of her courses, she will ban any form of recording lectures and distributing course content outside of the class.
“All class meetings will be held synchronously (in real time), and students will log onto Zoom through the course Canvas website…no one (neither the students nor the professor) will record class meetings,” Looney’s syllabus reads. “No one will circulate course readings, handouts, notes, or other materials to anyone outside of the class.”
Looney acknowledged the difficulty of enforcing such a policy and added another provision that students who do not feel comfortable during the lecture can mute their video or change their name.
“It [is] an honor code violation if anyone records the meeting. The difficulty with that is, of course, I can’t enforce it. As the meeting host, I cannot record myself. I can tell students not to record, but I don’t know if somebody is sitting here with their phone recording or using some other device to record,” Looney said in an interview with The Hoya. “An additional step is if students would like to refrain from using the video function or refrain from using their real name, then they have that option.”
The dangers of online learning are not limited to faculty and students involved with classes about China, according to Millward. Students and faculty taking classes about other authoritarian countries may also be at risk. 
Georgetown’s Chief Information Officer Judd Nicholson said the university has implemented a few policies to help protect students and faculty while learning online. The university is requiring students to sign up for Duo, a password authentication system, and has recommended methods to improve Zoom security. 
“Some individuals have reported that following best security practices related to Zoom, NetID accounts, and device hygiene are sufficient to assuage those fears,” Nicholson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Other individuals have reported that the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) may better address some of these challenges.” 
Millward said the university has improved its virtual security measures by realizing there is a need for classes to be both convenient and secure, but it needs to take more public steps to protect and warn the community about the potential dangers of virtual learning.
“We need to maximize accessibility where necessary by recording Zoom classes and other things and sending them out or making them available in the cloud to students, wherever they are,” Millward said. “But they’re afraid to mention that, you know, there is a danger — hard to quantify — but there is a risk to our students in authoritarian countries. They don’t want to put that down.”
Looney does worry some of the warnings about security risks may scare students away or cause them to self-censor. As a result, she decided to omit some of the more extreme risks from her syllabi. 
“I don’t want it to have a chilling effect on the class and really compromise academic freedom or free speech, and I do think that the probability of somebody being targeted by the Chinese government is low,” Looney said. “But the problem is we have no idea how these new policies are going to be enforced because they were just implemented. So, I have to err on the side of caution and try to protect everybody’s safety, while at the same time maintaining academic freedom, and it’s a really difficult balance.”

Significant work remains to be done in the global fight for women’s rights, according to former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright, who spoke at a virtual event Sept. 10.
The conversation focused on the 25th anniversary of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, which took place in Beijing, China in 1995. The conference is seen as a significant turning point for gender equality due to the passage of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action on women’s rights, which set an agenda to combat gender inequality around the world. The declaration focused on 12 policy areas, including equal access to education and gender-based violence. Clinton and Albright both attended the conference in Beijing as part of the United States’ delegation. 
The event, moderated by Ambassador for Global Women’s Issues Melanne Verveer, was organized by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, an organization that aims to promote women leaders in international diplomacy. 
Clinton, who was first lady at the time of the conference, said she is concerned about a lack of progress on gender equality since the Beijing summit. Clinton noted underrepresentation of women in elected offices and the business sector as evidence that sexism persists across the globe. 
“I’m disappointed that we haven’t gone even farther in 25 years,” Clinton said. “But that just energizes me more to speak out to work with others to defend those who are on the front lines.”
The former presidential candidate pointed to decreasing maternal mortality rates and rising education levels among women as signs of progress. Clinton expressed worry, however, that the recent resurgence of authoritarianism across the globe will undermine the progress that has been made.  
“I’m worried about the pushback and the backlash that we see from authoritarian leaders in particular, who are trying to turn the clock back,” Clinton said.
Albright, who was serving as U.S. ambassador to the UN in 1995, discussed the conference and the challenges of organizing a global summit on women’s issues, particularly in China. 
“The Chinese didn’t want the official delegates, and they certainly didn’t want the nongovernmental organizations there, and so they made it very difficult,” Albright said.
Clinton said she also faced intense political opposition in the lead-up to the event from Senate Republicans, who told her it was inappropriate to attend the conference.
“I told members of the administration in the White House and the State Department that if I didn’t go with the blessing of our government, I was going to get on a commercial plane and go,” Clinton said.
Clinton credited Albright’s tenure as secretary of state from 1997 to 2001 as a crucial step in actualizing the reforms that were developed at the conference. 
“When she became our first ever woman secretary of state, she really made it clear that the agenda coming out of Beijing was not just a luxury that, you know, would be nice to think about when we had time, but actually integrated into our foreign policy,” Clinton said of Albright.
Clinton, who herself became secretary of state during the Obama presidency, recalled her — now famous — speech at the conference, “Women’s Rights Are Human Rights,” which sought to promote the idea that advocacy for human rights was incomplete without a commitment to advancing the position of women throughout the globe.
“I wanted to push the envelope as far as I could for girls and women,” Clinton said. “We were determined to try to carry a message about the United States and our commitment — including ourselves, however — in the need to do better on women’s equality.”
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has only underscored the progress that remains to be made on gender equity, according to Clinton. Experts have found the economic downturn triggered by the outbreak has taken a disproportionate hit on women, with women accounting for 39% of global employment but 54% of job losses during the crisis.  
“Governments have to pay particular attention to rebuilding a post-COVID safety net and understanding the disproportionate costs that many people are bearing,” Clinton said. “They had nothing to do with creating this virus, but they are left holding the bag of burden.”
The panelists also agreed leaders will need to pay special attention to the needs of women of color and other marginalized groups.
“We have to do a better job of recognizing the additional challenges that stand in the way of equality,” Clinton said. “I think that the question really comes down to supporting and lifting up and giving more prevalence in public debate and decision making.”
To progress towards greater gender equality, Albright urged women to support each other in the workforce and advocated for increased access to technology in developing countries. For progress to be made, governments need to devote themselves to sustained reform efforts, according to Albright.
“Nothing happens automatically,”Albright said. “I think we can see that we can all be proud of Beijing, and many of us have tried to carry on, but it requires deliberate action.”

In past semesters, members of the Georgetown Parliamentary Debate Team spent their evenings practicing in windowless ICC classrooms before trouncing their opponents at tournaments across the country. 
This semester, they have had to adjust their operations. Their debate tournaments, as well as all their practices, will be held virtually, causing GPD President Cindy Wang (SFS ’21) to worry that it may be hard to sustain student engagement and build a tightly knit cohort of debaters. However, new students seem eager to join the club; the team saw a 30% increase in membership this fall. 
“The biggest challenge we have right now is how to keep our members around and foster the same environment we would have with in-person physical interaction, because that historically has been a really important part for us to bond as a community,” Wang told The Hoya in a Zoom interview.
Because the semester is fully virtual, many Georgetown clubs are developing new ways to bring on new members and sustain club activities. Many have seen surprising increases in student involvement since the Council of Advisory Boards Fair at the beginning of the month.
Many clubs are focusing on creating methods to improve Zoom fatigue, a phrase of the times describing the adverse effects of excessive screen time on physical and psychological health. 
H*yas For Choice, a group that advocates for reproductive justice and provides contraceptives to students, recognizes the toll the virtual environment can take on members, according to Vice President Rachel Harris (COL ’21).
“When meeting, learning, or doing advocacy work through a virtual forum, it is inherently impersonal and isolating,” Harris wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are trying to mitigate these issues by meeting with each of our advocacy team members one on one to check in and provide support in any way we can.” 
H*yas for Choice is also taking steps to combat Zoom fatigue by keeping meetings to an hour length, hosting smaller, more personal discussions, and keeping members engaged on GroupMe, Harris wrote. 
Despite the virtual setting, Harris has witnessed energetic engagement and commitment from its members.
“Honestly, I have been surprised by the willingness and dedication of individuals for involvement. Virtual learning environments are extremely draining, and to see that individuals are still invigorated about advocating for reproductive and sexual wellness is keeping me hopeful and inspired this semester,” Harris wrote.
Hoya Blue, the student fan section for Georgetown’s sports teams, has already implemented new virtual club activities to help members stay engaged and get to know each other, according to Vice President Lauren Pyjar (SFS ’21).
“We did a virtual trivia night last week, and then this coming week we are doing speed dating, which is kinda fun — not like actually dating — but just one-on-one two-minute conversations over Zoom just to get to know people,” Pyjar said in an interview with The Hoya. “Coming up, I think we are going to do once a week or every other week group watches of old games”
Though new students are eager to engage with club life, club members face significant geographical and technological barriers to participating in club life.
Freshman Wenyu Zhu (COL ’24), who lives in China, has found it difficult to engage in club activities late into the night. 
“For me, the virtual environment is mainly difficult for my 12-hour time difference,” Zhu wrote in an email to The Hoya. “As an international student, I only have limited choices regarding time difference, but if I decide to stay up, my body doesn’t allow me to be engaged at that time.” 
Although there have been some challenges with joining clubs virtually, clubs remain an active presence in student life. 
Some students, like freshman Mehek Thapar (COL ’24), who has already joined GU Jawani, Mask and Bauble, and Hoya Blue, among others, have immersed themselves in club life. 
“I am a person who really likes to stay busy, and I love that there are so many club events happening and that I can already get involved,” Thapar wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These clubs have definitely been my main social interaction, and a lot of them are focusing more on community building and bonding in the fall, which is nice, especially for a virtual semester where it’s so hard to get to know people.”

Georgetown University parents have flooded social media and administrators’ inboxes with messages urging the university to reopen campus for Zoom-weary students in the spring. 
The effort to reopen campus began in the Class of 2024 parent Facebook group in September. Posts complaining about the negative effects of virtual learning on students quickly evolved into a full-fledged lobbying campaign to reopen campus.
After gathering momentum, parents created a separate Facebook group, “Students and Parents Advocating for Georgetown Students on Campus,” which now has over 500 members. The group’s efforts culminated in the circulation of a petition which has garnered over 1000 signatures from parents, students and other supporters as of Oct. 22. 
The university originally planned to house the entire freshman class on campus but walked back its decision in August as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to worsen. Approximately 500 students are living on the main campus this fall because of academic requirements or unstable home situations. 
Because of a supposed lack of communication from the university about spring semester plans, 52 parents of first-years signed and sent a letter to the university Sept. 21 demanding greater transparency and urging the university to bring students back, according to a Facebook post with a copy of the letter. 
“We urge you to find a way to have freshmen on campus this fall, and no later than January, even if some or all classes are online,” the letter reads. “Is it imperative that the Class of 2024, who missed prom, graduation, and innumerable other once-in-a-lifetime high school experiences, is allowed to have what remains of their freshman year on campus? We believe the answer to this question is an emphatic and overwhelming yes.”
After receiving a muted response from the university to the group letter and other direct messages, the group published the petition Oct. 13. The social and emotional benefits of being on campus, the petition argues, outweigh the potential risks of infection spikes. As of Oct. 22, more than 214,000 COVID-19 cases have emerged on more than 1,600 college campuses across the country, according to a New York Times database. 
“Unfortunately, COVID-19 will not be gone anytime soon, and we need Georgetown’s leadership to get their students who wish to be on campus to be allowed to do so no later than January,” the petition reads. “Students must have the opportunity to be a part of the Georgetown Community  and the benefit of in-person learning which is only truly possible if they are on campus.”
The petition also demands the university be more transparent with the university community about its COVID-19 response plans, a critique raised by many students and faculty over the course of the pandemic. 
The group hopes the petition will garner support from the broader Georgetown community, not just parents of first-years, according to Heidi Hermelin, the parent who wrote the petition.
“The goal of the petition was to create a platform for more people to have a joined voice to the administration that we feel it’s very important to the education and the emotional wellbeing of the students, and not just the freshmen,” Hermelin said in an interview with The Hoya. 
The administration expects to publish a preliminary plan for the spring semester by Nov. 16, according to a systemwide email from University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95). 
“We are closely monitoring our capacity to meet the public health needs of our community, as the conditions of the pandemic continue to evolve. This involves reviewing a number of internal and external factors,” the email reads. “We are also closely monitoring the experiences of our peer institutions, with the understanding that each school’s approach reflects their individual context.”
In the meantime, the university will begin publishing more frequent updates for families about the university’s pandemic response. Students and families can also sign up for the university’s daily COVID-19 digest and watch DeGioia’s weekly video policy updates, according to an email from a university spokesperson.
Despite these moves toward greater transparency, the desire to reopen campus persists, and some parents have undertaken more intense strategies to compel the university to invite students back. 
Some parents have suggested withholding tuition in the spring if Georgetown does not allow students to return, while others have commented that their student will begin applying to transfer schools, according to several posts in the Facebook group. 
Other parent graduates have shared they will not be donating to the university until administrators communicate a plan to bring students back to campus.

With the impressive research being done at GU combined w the fact that DC has the 5th lowest cases of covid, it should be possible to bring students to campus. And if the neighborhood is a concern, students on campus should be far more desirable to them than the hoards of kids that will be inundating the neighborhoods should GU not open.

GU  Should be obligated and determined to bring back our seniors who will be graduating next year. So many other colleges have worked out safe plans and we don’t understand why GU is not working harder to adapt to plan for their seniors! It’s proven it can be done let’s just do it.

Yes! Fordham is doing a great job with all students back at their 2 densely populated city campuses. They test and their overall covid positivity rate is around .001% and of those who have tested positive, a large majority live off campus. This can be done!

You guys only care more about yourself instead of other’s life. Will the US be able to test the population on the same scale as China? Would everyone cooperate? Life comes first! Why do college kids don’t care about the public’s life! COVID-19 can rebound in all countries. Do you think the U.S. is doing better than Europe? Europe is facing a case rebound. And those who clamor to go back to school will be life killers

Thank you for your well written and well researched article and for bringing attention to this important issue. It is imperative that Georgetown begin making plans instead of excuses and allow students to be on campus. Covid 19 is not going away any time soon. We need to plan and prepare but also go on with our lives. It is vital that students be on campus.

Excellent article bringing visibility to a larger audience. Parents have considerable and valid concerns about the negative mental, intellectual and spiritual impact of the probable decision to keep all of the student body, or a large percentage, off campus next semester. Students will continue to miss a crucial component of their Georgetown education, Washington, DC.
The Georgetown College website page promotes, ‘The Washington, DC Classroom’. 
 “Beyond the monuments and museums, DC is a city where students can extend their learning in practical and professional environments.” 
“Beyond internships, students can travel easily into Washington, DC, to find resources to support their education.”
“The college is committed to connecting our students to opportunities typically unavailable to undergraduates.”

In a school of 7500, assuming a 0.3% positivity rate (as previously reported) and a 0.003% mortality rate (for people ~20 years old), we would lose 0.000675 students. In any other scenario—one not being distorted for political gain, in which people’s mental health and academic/professional futures aren’t being held hostage—that would round to zero. We lost thousands of times that number of students last year in natural disasters and accidents, yet we don’t ban students from travel or driving.
The administration claims time and again that the quality of Zoom University is the same as on-campus, yet they tout DC’s opportunities and atmosphere (which one can only take advantage of in-person) at every chance they get. The hypocrisy is disgusting. So now I have to commute over an hour each way for an internship (lucky to live somewhat close to DC), since they’re smart enough to have in-person opportunities.

1) “assuming a .3% positivity rate” is a bit of a stretch.  That may well be what it averages out to, but there’s always the chance for a spike in which far more students get it.
2) “and a .003% mortality rate (for people ~20 years old)” except again, you’re forgetting a variety of factors—people with pre-existing conditions affecting lung health, people with diabetes or hypertension or other cardiac illnesses, immunocompromised folks, and so on—*and* of course the fact that students would be far from the only people on campus in the event of a full-fledged return.  Professors, facilities workers, —how many of *their* lives are you willing to sacrifice?  Are you so confident that it will “round down to zero” given that hundreds of thousands of people have died of covid this year?  I’ve struggled with mental health issues for a very long time, and I get that this sucks.  Online school is not the same as on-campus school.  I get it.  But we don’t have the right to buy the ability to be on-campus with other people’s lives.

M. Schmidt says 
October 22, 2020 at 2:37 pm
The affect on all the classes of the student body is terrible. They each lose a crucial experience in different ways.
My son is a sophomore and was only on campus for one full semester his freshman year. If spring semester is off campus, he will have missed three semesters with an on campus experience.
He has friends at Notre Dame, another private catholic college, that are on campus with a very well managed testing and quarantine (should it be necessary) system.

Please address in another article how many universities are bringing back their seniors for spring semester- this connection that this will create will continue on well beyond graduation from a development point of view- crazy that the administration hasn’t focused in on this given the class of 2020 had no special send- ofd

David Tanczos says

As a parent in the Facebook group referenced in this article, I am concerned that the GU administration seems to be defining “health and safety” solely as the number of COVID cases without taking mental health impacts of anxiety and depression into consideration when making their decisions on whether to open to more students and to how many. The feelings of isolation and abandonment are real, and the mental health impacts can be severe. In fact, even Dr. Fauci is now saying that public health measures shouldn’t get in the way of opening, and that we should put the concept of a physical shutdown away. Instead, he says we should focus on public health measures to safely get us to where we want to go. Also, the GU administration has said that the campus is currently open, when in reality, it’s closed to 94% of all undergrads. Last, during one of last week’s Zoom sessions for GU’s Family Weekend, GU described the virtual environment as delivering a “Signature Georgetown experience”. While we certainly appreciate the hard work and dedication of the faculty, the virtual environment lacks the richness of the in-person experience and it isn’t what our students deserve. Even if just the dorms are open and classes are online, that’s a huge step forward. The administration has recently shown some improvement in communications which is appreciated, and we hope that continues. The next step is to open to a significant number of students in January. It can be done safely.

Thank you, David!! This is exactly right. I couldn’t agree more. Could you please share the link for the Facebook group? It’s not coming up in searches. My husband and I both graduated from Gtown, we have 1 child who is an alum, and another who is a current student. This cannot be allowed to go on any longer. It is damaging so many student’s lives. We saved for so many years to send our children to college. To think that we are paying ridiculous amounts of money for the university to play loose and free with the devastating consequences of keeping young people out of school. Notre Dame, Villanova, Boston College, & many others have all figured out ways to make it work for students. I believe Georgetown’s lack of leadership is unconscionable.

Why is America the way it is? Ask your President! The US do not need to follow what China did, but what about Europe? The epidemic is now under control in Europe. If you have COVID-19, you’ll regret the decision you had to make to open the building again! Not only you, but all of us face the problem of the quality of this class! Your job should be to succeed in this environment, not to complain!

Let’s be real folks. The Georgetown University administration is incompetent and cowardly. The school community is irreparably damaged and students currently enrolled are left with a disgusting taste in their mouths. As if it’s not bad enough to not open, students on and off campus are treated like criminals in a quasi surveillance state. The school will be in financial ruins (more than it already is) given how much they’ve alienated their students. Kiss any alumni support goodbye.

y’all should read about all the massive outbreaks at schools that have much larger campuses and de-densified housing. In my dorm freshman year there was a point where each and every one of us had the flu – at the same time. and wait until you hear about the students’ experiences in quarantine housing at these re-opened schools. y’all would be kidding yourselves if you think there won’t be parties or large gatherings if every student is brought back.
Another thing: many students in actual need of on-campus housing were rejected in the fall. y’all weren’t rallying for them were you. 
Before any class year is prioritized, gtown needs to get all their vulnerable students on campus. those without cushy homes. period.

CDC Weekly Update from their website: “Nationally, the overall percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, increased from 5.6% during week 41 to 6.3% during week 42. Percent positivity increased among all age groups…. Based on death certificate data, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 (PIC) for week 42 was 7.6%.” That’s 36 deaths among the student population, assuming that the pandemic does not get any worse in the upcoming holiday season as projected. If there was a loose gunmen that killed half of that many students in Georgetown it would be considered a national tragedy and the blame would have fallen on the university for not properly protecting their students. How is it possibly unreasonable to follow national trends and expert advice when structuring a temporary distance learning environment? Transparency has been amazing, I have received an email at least once a week discussing ongoing planning and concerns related to Covid-19.

David Tanczos says 
October 24, 2020 at 11:50 am
I certainly respect your opinion.  Our group has been advocating for each student to have the option to live in the dorms or remain remote (just like many other schools have been doing successfully), so those wanting to stay remote would have the option to do so.  Also, while we’d prefer for classes to be in-person, we are open to classes remaining online if the students are allowed in the dorms.  In addition, the on-campus GU environment requires testing twice per week, masks, social distancing, and would have supervision (among many other safety measures), so it seems to be an extremely safe environment.  Furthermore, we believe we are following the science — even Dr. Fauci is now saying that public health measures shouldn’t get in the way of opening, and that we should put the concept of a physical shutdown away.  Instead, he says we should focus on public health measures to safely get us to where we want to go.  Also, the stats that apply to the 20 year-old student population seem to be more accurately depicted in the comment by “Georgetown Sophomore” on 10/23 at 10:46 am.  And while GU administration’s communication has improved recently, transparency has been a challenge.  For example, the administration has indicated that the DC government has made opening a challenge, yet Catholic University, also in DC, opened to freshmen in August.  I have not heard an explanation for how Catholic U could open to more students but GU couldn’t.  It certainly seems to indicate that the decision to not open in August was GU’s, not the DC government’s.  GU is an in-person university, and it has an obligation to its students to open as soon as it is safe to do so.  Many other schools in similar environments have opened safely and successfully, so GU students deserve the option to at least live in the dorms.  We have offered our help, cooperation, and support to the GU administration if there’s anything we can do to help achieve this goal.

The problem is Under certain medical conditions, the virus doesn’t necessarily kill you. However, it is enough to make students feel weak and withdraw from the class. Think about those who travel across the state. It’s contagious on planes, it’s contagious on trains, it’s contagious in public toilets, it’s too risky.GU must be careful in his decision. Without life, a diploma is nothing

The American public should expect election interference from both foreign and domestic actors in the 2020 U.S. presidential election but should not be discouraged from voting, panelists said at a conversation with the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service moderated by Executive Director Mo Elleithee (SFS ’94).
GU Politics hosted the Oct. 9 event, “Protecting Democracy: A Conversation on Election Integrity with Former DHS Secretaries,” which featured two former Secretaries of Homeland Security: Michael Chertoff, who served under President George W. Bush from 2005 to 2009, and Jeh Johnson, who served under President Barack Obama from 2013 to 2017.
The panelists said although misinformation and voter manipulation online pose a real problem, voters can be confident in the United States’ electoral process and that their votes will count.
Given the structure of the U.S. election process, Johnson said the biggest threats to the integrity of the election could be classified into three main categories: a cyberattack on election infrastructure, the weaponization of stolen cyber information and the spread of disinformation and misinformation.
“A national election result can be altered by upsetting the voting in just a few key precincts in a few key states,” Johnson said. “That is not necessarily a cyber vulnerability; there are things one could do, or have attempted in the past to do, to suppress particular precincts.” 
In 2016, the Russian government hacked into and stole information from the Democratic National Committee. It is believed the Russian government weaponized the stolen information to influence the results of the election. Although this was not the first time a foreign actor hacked a campaign, it was the first time the information was deployed to assert influence over voters. 
Russia is not the only country believed to have meddled in U.S. elections. China and Iran have also been known to involve themselves in some of the same ways Russia did in the 2016 U.S. elections. 
The federal government must be proactive in establishing deterrents against foreign interference in future elections, according to Johnson.
“I believe, at some point, our government will create sufficient deterrents so that foreign governments discontinue the bad behavior and move on to something else,” Johnson said. “Don’t plan for the last attack, plan for the next attack.”
Although foreign interference was a main culprit of election meddling in the 2016 election and will continue to pose a threat, Chertoff warned domestic interference is just as serious this election season.
“Much of the most inflammatory content is domestically generated,” Chertoff said. “All that Russians do is sit back and watch and pick the things they think are the most outrageous.”
Social media has become a gateway for the spread of misinformation and disinformation among the public. Recently, Twitter and Facebook have taken measures to limit their role in the advance of fake news. Twitter decided to make changes to the ability of politicians and others to retweet fake information, and Facebook announced they will not allow any political ads in the week leading up to the presidential election. 
Johnson agreed most distribution of interference in U.S. elections comes from domestic content and said some of the responsibility to keep elections fair is on the shoulders of the American public.
“The public has a role to play here. The public has to accept responsibility for discerning some of the junk they consume and recognizing it as such,” Johnson said. “And if we do that, then we go a long way from insulating ourselves from this type of threat and this type of vulnerability.”
The difficulty that comes with content moderation is discerning where freedom of speech crosses the line into the manipulation of eligible voters. According to Chertoff, social media does not bear all of the responsibility when it comes to regulating misinformation. Other media, including news radio or broadcast television, must moderate their own content too.
“We need to have professionalism restored to mainstream media,” Chertoff said. “The truth is, many people get the most misleading disinformation from turning on their favorite cable news channel.”
The panelists agreed fears about voter fraud are overblown because it would be difficult for fraud to affect a large-scale election. Johnson and Chertoff also said no eligible U.S. citizen should be deterred from voting this election cycle.
“It should not discourage anyone from participating in our democracy,” Johnson said. “I believe that there is a civic obligation among voters, among those eligible to vote, to be smart about their vote, and to pierce through the disinformation out there on social media and be a smart voter.”

Georgetown University received improperly disclosed gifts and contracts from Chinese, Saudi Arabian and Qatari foreign entities, a recently released report from U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos alleges.  
These foreign relationships pose a risk to national security, the Department of Education says. The DOE report accuses several prominent U.S. universities — including Georgetown, Harvard University, Yale University and Stanford University — of failing to disclose several billion dollars in funding and resources from foreign donors. Georgetown officials dispute the allegations and say the report misconstrues the nature of Georgetown’s foreign relationships and financial reports.
In June 2019, DeVos initiated civil investigations into 12 universities, including Georgetown, to ensure their compliance with Section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, which requires institutions of higher education to transparently report foreign gifts and contracts. 
The inquiries prompted institutions to “catch up” on their reporting, which has led to disclosure of $6.5 billion previously unreported foreign gifts and contracts since the investigations began, according to the report. 
The report scrutinizes the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, an academic center housed in Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service. The ACMCU was originally established as the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding in 1993 before it was renamed after Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal after Georgetown received a $20 million gift in 2005 from the Saudi royal.
The ACMCU aims to promote improved understanding between Muslim and Christian communities worldwide, according to its website. However, the DOE report claims Talal’s donation “empowered the Saudi Arabian government to advance a particular narrative about Islamic society to the West via a legitimate Western institution.”
The DOE report cited a 2008 letter addressed to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) from former Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) expressing concern that the center’s academic independence could be “compromised” by the gift. The DOE report also listed past criticism of the ACMCU “deceptively labeling itself as pluralistic” and failing to fulfill its stated mission of promoting Christian studies.
ACMCU Director John Esposito rebuked the DOE’s allegations in an email to The Hoya, writing that Georgetown has accurately filled out its financial reports.
“Georgetown carefully reviews all gifts to ensure they are in alignment with our values and our educational objectives and retains full authority over expenditure decisions,” Esposito wrote. “Unlike many other institutions, we have not had to supplement or correct any of Georgetown’s previous Section 117 reports.”
Despite the university’s compliance with Section 117, the language of the report does not make that distinction and is therefore misleading, according to Esposito. The DOE expects to close this particular investigation soon, Esposito added. 
“Despite Georgetown’s full compliance with Section 117, the DoEd report lumps Georgetown with the other institutions it is investigating in ways that imply non-compliance,” Esposito wrote. 
The report also criticizes an $10 million agreement between the Spring Breeze Foundation and Georgetown to support a U.S.-China dialogue initiative. The Spring Breeze Foundation is financed by CP Group, a multinational conglomerate based in Thailand, according to a university announcement from 2016. The DOE report alleges that CP Group has ties to the Chinese government. The report, however, does not offer any citations or proof of this allegation besides a 2019 news story about a contract signed by CP Group, a Chinese corporation and a host of other businesses to build a railroad connecting three airports in southern Thailand.
The report also claims that Georgetown “derived $2,369,807” through “significant intermingling with the People’s Republic of China.” This information was later redacted from the report Thursday evening. 
According to a university spokesperson, the report establishes an erroneous link between academic exchange programs with the Chinese Central Party School and a figure from Georgetown’s IRS Form 990. The spokesperson said it appears that number represents expenditures by Georgetown in the East Asia and Pacific region, which encompassses more than 30 countries, rather than gifts to or contracts with Georgetown. Furthermore, approximately half of the $2.3 million represents study abroad scholarships for Georgetown students studying in the region, according to the spokesperson.
Finally, the report alleges that overseas facilities operated by U.S. universities pose a risk to national security. Campuses located in Doha, Qatar, “could harbor research laboratories and other educational resources that are almost entirely unregulated by American law,” the report asserts. 
Georgetown University in Qatar opened in 2005 as part of a partnership between Georgetown and the Qatar Foundation, a nonprofit that receives money from the Qatari government. 
The report alleges that the Qatar Foundation prevented a Lebanese band with an openly gay lead singer from speaking on Northwestern University’s Qatar campus and that the organization censors viewpoints not endorsed by the Qatari government. 
A spokesperson for GU-Q did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In response to a request for comment, the DOE sent Hoya reporters a link to the original department press release.  
Esposito said the report draws incorrect conclusions about the nature of Georgetown’s foreign partnerships because it fails to consider the entire picture.
“In each of these engagements, Georgetown requires and preserves academic excellence, institutional autonomy, academic freedom and open inquiry and debate, and service to the common good,” Esposito said.

With a new administration set to enter the White House in January, the United States must rebuild its tainted global image, three former U.S. foreign policy leaders said during a virtual panel Tuesday. 
The panel, which included former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, retired four-star general George Casey and ex-CIA director George Tenet, expressed concern over the United States’ diminished international reputation and its consequences for future foreign policy. As the panelists discussed the country’s tarnished image, the Trump campaign continued its tenuous legal battle to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, an effort experts warn will further undermine the country’s democratic image and institutions. 
In only the past year, the country’s reputation has slipped to new lows, according to Albright. 
“I think that things have gotten harder for the United States in the last year. Our reputation has sunk lower. The last meeting that I went to, a real one, was in Europe at the Munich Security Conference in March. We were kind of a joke, even then,” Albright said. 
President Donald Trump first announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord in 2017, but the withdrawal became official this November. Countries criticized the United States for backing out, and the reputation of the United States has continued to drop around the world, particularly in light of the botched response to COVID-19. Health experts blasted Trump this summer for withdrawing from the World Health Organization amid a health crisis, another in a long list of missteps the panel said has hurt the United States’ reputation.
The world is watching to see what direction the United States is heading, according to Albright. 
“But I think it’s been a very hard year in terms of how the United States has been regarded, and I think that in many ways we have gotten deeper into kind of a sense of where is the United States, what is the role of the United States and how are we going to behave now,” Albright said.
Casey warned that in the past four years, the United States has fallen behind the rest of the world. 
“For me, it’s more than just the last year. It’s really the past four years. And as I think about President-elect Biden left the office, it was four years ago, and even more has happened in those four years than has happened in the last year. And we kind of turned inward, and I think the world moved on.” Casey said. 
Casey noted that the Biden administration will also have to address a host of complex security issues, including the ascendancy of Russia and China, Iran and North Korea’s growing nuclear capabilities and a revived terrorist threat to the United States and its allies. 
“We’re even more divided politically than we were four years ago, and we’re dealing with a pandemic that’s affecting us personally and economically, and the administration really has its work cut out for them,” Casey said. “I think the road back to global leadership for the United States is going to take a long time if it happens at all.” 
The three panelists agreed that the path for the United States to regain its global credibility is leading the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I do think that one really does have to do COVID first in all its aspects because it’s a virus that knows no borders,” Albright said. “It means dealing with things in the United States, but then also reestablishing ourselves in terms of trying to help those countries where it hasn’t hit yet, and how do we work with the World Health Organization.” 
The Trump administration received strong criticism from foreign policy experts for gutting government departments of their career civil servants and undermining the work of foreign policy workers with political intrigue. To effectively reestablish U.S. primacy on the global stage, the Biden administration must also reverse the internal damage done by the Trump administration to the country’s foreign policy apparatus, according to Albright.  
“There’s going to have to be some kind of a way that the various departments that are involved in national security have to be revived and have to get their reputations back and have to be populated by people who actually know what they are doing,” Albright said. “That part is going to be very important, and I now believe more and more that the issues that are out there require more departments to be involved in them, kind of whole of government approach.”

CW: This article discusses human trafficking. Please refer to the end of the article for on and off-campus resources.
Human trafficking is fundamentally modern slavery and deserves greater public awareness, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the crisis, panelists said at a Sept. 20 virtual event. 
At the event, titled “Human Trafficking: The Deafening Silence over Modern Slavery,” human trafficking experts and activists shed light on the current state of human trafficking worldwide. The event was co-hosted by the Free Speech Project, a Georgetown University research initiative that documents threats to free speech, and the Future of the Humanities Project at Georgetown, which gathers scholars to discuss current interdisciplinary issues.
The United Nations defines human trafficking as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of people through force, fraud or deception, with the aim of exploiting them for profit. In public discourse, human trafficking is widely referred to as “modern slavery.” 
While some may disagree with this nomenclature, the title of modern slavery is fitting for human trafficking because of the common principle of forced labor, according to panelist EleSondra DeRomano. DeRomano is a sex trafficking survivor and the founder of Standing Together Against Real Slavery (STARS), an organization dedicated to supporting young women who have experienced or are at high risk for sex trafficking. 
“To me, it is slavery,” DeRomano said at the event. “It’s slavery. And slavery is supposed to be abolished.”
As another parallel, human trafficking patterns are reminiscent of historic slave trade routes, according to panelist Lisa Hsin, an Oxford University researcher.
“There’s certainly trade routes for trafficking victims,” Hsin said at the event. “I would say southeast Asia to places like the more affluent Taiwan or China. You can locate how they’re trafficked over there, and you can essentially follow the footsteps of trafficking victims.”
In 2020, nearly 25 million people worldwide were estimated to be the victims of human trafficking, according to the U.S. Department of State. However, human trafficking is vastly underreported, and the majority of cases go undetected, according to the National Institute of Justice.
Human trafficking is onerous to prosecute because of its international network and underground nature, according to Pippa Hockton, founder of Street Talk, an organization that provides counseling to female victims of human trafficking.
“It’s organized crime. It’s all very international. It’s highly organized. It’s very, very difficult to catch,” Hockton said at the event. “They are very well-informed and know the loopholes in the law.”
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of individuals at risk for human trafficking, according to Christina Bain, the former director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Program on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery.
“And especially now with the pandemic,” Bain said at the event. “I think there is the fear that this crime has also been exacerbated by certain circumstances around the pandemic including economic vulnerabilities. So, I think we still have a long road ahead.”
Reduced wages and job loss during the pandemic have made people more vulnerable to exploitation by human traffickers, according to a 2021 report by the U.S. Department of State. Additionally, COVID-19 stay-at-home orders increased rates of gender-based violence, substance abuse, and mental health issues, all of which put people at greater risk of exploitation, according to the report. 
Current anti-trafficking programs fall short in ensuring long-term wellbeing for survivors, according to Hockton.
“I feel as though there’s a willful neglect on the part of services,” Hockton said. “These people don’t have services. They don’t matter. And services are not for the purpose of looking after these people from childhood on up.”
Despite mounting challenges, increased awareness around the issue of human trafficking can help prevent more people from falling victim to human traffickers, according to DeRomano.
“I believe that there are changes being made, and I’m very optimistic and happy about that,” DeRomano said. “Even if it’s two lives we save, that’s two lives that we’ve saved.”

Georgetown University student Victor Liu (COL ’22) and his sister arrived in the United States after being barred from leaving China for three years.
While visiting their dying grandfather in June 2018, Sandra Han, the siblings’ mother, was detained by Chinese authorities. Government officials subsequently banned Liu, a classics and economics student, and his sister, Cynthia, from leaving China in an effort to force their father, Liu Changming, to surrender to criminal charges for his alleged financial crimes. Changming, a former executive at a state-owned bank, is one of China’s most-wanted fugitives for his involvement in a $1.4 billion fraud case. He fled China and has been in hiding since 2007.
After news of the Lius’ situation spread, Georgetown student advocacy groups like the Asian American Student Association Political Awareness Committee and faculty urged government officials and the university administration to advocate for the Liu siblings’ release. The case also gained national attention in January 2020 when Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called on former President Donald Trump to urge the Chinese government to release Victor and Cynthia. 
The Asian American Student Association Political Awareness Committee declined to comment when contacted by The Hoya. 
According to former United States Ambassador to the United Nations David Pressman, a U.S. based lawyer who has helped lead the Liu’s legal efforts, Victor and Cynthia’s release is a long-awaited outcome.
“At long last, two young Americans are back home in America, once again able to enjoy the daily blessings of freedom we all too often take for granted in this country,” Pressman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “After years of painstaking and difficult work by many people, it was a privilege to be able to finally embrace Victor and Cynthia and welcome them home.” 
Former Ambassador Marc Ginsberg, who is serving pro bono as the siblings’ main legal representation, declined to comment on the case when contacted by The Hoya.
Foreign policy experts and scholars of international law like Diana Fu, associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto, have raised questions about the timing of the Liu siblings’ release, however, alleging that the release was linked to a Sept. 24 Justice Department deal that allowed Meng Wanzhou, a Huawei executive who was involved in a fraud case related to the company’s sale of communications equipment to Iran, to return to China. The Department of Justice denied any link between the two cases, according to The New York Times.
The Chinese government barred the Liu siblings from leaving China under an “exit ban,” which prohibits citizens from leaving the country. The Chinese government has increased its use of the policy over the past three years. Though there is no consensus, some international law scholars consider exit bans to be a form of hostage holding.
The international community must learn from the Lius’ situation and develop specific strategies and rules around the use of exit bans, according to Thomas Kellogg, executive director of the Center for Asian Law, a teaching and research center at the Georgetown University Law Center.
“There needs to be a way to send a clear and unified signal from the international community that exit bans against foreign citizens — and against China’s own citizens! — are not an acceptable way to deal with diplomatic spats or economic disputes,” Kellogg wrote in an email to The Hoya. “China needs to change its approach, and the U.S. and other key allies need to continue to press China to abide by its obligations under international law.”
The siblings are currently residing in the New York area, according to The New York Times. Their mother remains in jail, however, Ginsberg told The New York Times.
Throughout the last three years, Georgetown has been in regular contact with Victor and has continually advocated for his release by meeting with both U.S. and Chinese government officials several times, according to a university spokesperson. 
University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95), who visited with Victor in Beijing during a November trip to Asia, welcomed the news of the Liu siblings’ release.
“We have awaited this moment with great anticipation, for Victor and our entire Georgetown community,” DeGioia wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We look forward to welcoming Victor back to campus.”
This article was updated October 1 to accurately reflect former Ambassador David Pressman’s role in the Liu siblings’ legal efforts.

The U.S.-China trade war was unsuccessful in its goal of pressuring American and allied multinational corporations to exit China and instead passed down increased business costs to consumers, a panelist said at a Sept. 24 virtual event. 
The event, titled “Political Risk and Firm Exit: Evidence from the U.S.-China Trade War,” featured experts shedding light on the impacts of the U.S.-China trade war based on the results of their latest research study of the same title. The event was hosted by the department of government and the Georgetown Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues, as a part of its Chinese Politics and Economy Research Seminar series, which convenes scholars to share the latest research on China. 
The U.S.-China trade war is an ongoing economic conflict between China and the United States that began in January 2018 after former President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on China with the goal of changing “unfair trade practices.” The Chinese government responded by levying its own tariffs on American goods. 
Beyond Trump’s stated goals, the intent of the trade war was to pressure American and allied multinational companies to cease operations in China, according to Samantha Vortherms, assistant professor of political science at the University of California Irvine and co-author of “Political Risk and Firm Exit: Evidence from the U.S.-China Trade War.”
“Policymakers hoped that the trade war would encourage decoupling with China, that these policy measures would encourage both U.S. firms and firms of U.S. allies to walk away from China,” Vortherms said at the event. 
In January 2020, both the United States and China signed an initial agreement to de-escalate tensions. The agreement addressed intellectual property concerns, agricultural trade and financial services, among other topics, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Despite the agreement, tensions have persisted into the administration of President Joe Biden, as the Chinese government reportedly failed to meet purchasing benchmarks in January 2021, according to CNBC.
The U.S.-China trade war elevated political risks for multinational corporations operating in China, increasing the number of companies who left the country, according to Vortherms. 
“The largest effect of the trade war: All firms, regardless of tariff or country of origin, are more likely to exit during the trade war,” Vortherms said.
By July 2019, more than 50 major companies announced their intent to pull production from China as a result of the trade war. But rather than move their operations to the United States as Trump urged, many rebuilt supply chains in Southeast Asia. 
The U.S.-China trade war was not successful in its goal of pressuring United States and allied companies out of China as firms could adapt to the increased business costs that the tariffs created, according to Vortherms.
“Multinational corporations that did not experience tariffs saw the largest blunt effects of the trade war. And U.S. firms were less likely to exit than other firms overall,” Vortherms said.
Since the Biden administration took office in January, talks between trade representatives for the two countries have reportedly stalled, leaving tariffs in place, including a 25% import tax. In response, groups representing various U.S. business interests sent a letter to the Biden administration in August, urging the two countries to resume negotiations, according to The New York Times.
Despite the continuing tensions, many businesses have reason to remain optimistic about the future of U.S.-China trade relations, according to Vortherms.
“For supporters of trade, there’s reason to be optimistic because the overarching trend is continuing business as usual. It’s also important to remember that tariffs still affect outcomes: Instead of firms exiting the markets, firms are absorbing the cost of these tariffs,” said Vortherms. 
Still, the impacts of the trade war will continue to be felt by consumers until the trade dispute is resolved, according to Vortherms.
“It is still increasing the cost of business — just not to the degree that it’s pushing firms out. And instead, that means that the effect of the trade war is getting rolled down to customers,” Vortherms said.

Trump’s trade war was successful in getting America’s politicians united in confronting China on trade. Also, Trump was successful in curling China’s tech ambitions and making a more secure US supply chain. The trade war was never really about deficits, which most economists miss. Also, as an American, I will and would gladly pay more money for non-Chinese goods or heavily taxed Chinese-made junk that is necessary.

Technological innovations are key elements of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) plan to combat emerging threats, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at an Oct. 5 event.
The event, titled “NATO in a Competitive World,” was hosted by the Walsh School of Foreign Service and the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy organization. Stoltenberg, who served two terms as prime minister of Norway, spoke about NATO’s emerging technological programs to combat burgeoning security threats. The conversation was moderated by Dr. Michael O’Hanlon, the Brookings Institution’s director of research in foreign policy and adjunct professor at Georgetown’s Center for Security Studies. 
NATO is at a critical point where it is facing new security threats, according to Stoltenberg. 
“We are at a pivotal moment for our shared security where we face a more dangerous and more competitive world. Russia is more aggressive abroad and more oppressive at home. China is using its economic and military might to control its own people, coerce other countries, and assert control over global supply chains, critical infrastructure and other assets,” Stoltenberg said in the event. “We also face more frequent and sophisticated cyber-attacks, persistent terrorist threats and the security impacts of climate change.” 
NATO was formed in 1949 as a military alliance between 12 North American and Western European countries to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. Since then, it has expanded to include 30 member states and aims to guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means, according to its website. 
In order to adapt to 21st century challenges, NATO’s members are increasing military spending and developing technological solutions through civil-military partnerships, according to Stoltenberg.NATO created the Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), a proposal for the NATO 2030 agenda that is a roadmap for the coming decade that will prepare the organization to combat predicted threats. DIANA provides a space for civilian and military organizations to work together in fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology and space to secure NATO’s technological advantage against security threats. 
In addition to the cyber program portion of DIANA, NATO has also developed offensive cyber technologies to combat cyber threats from non-state actors like the terrorist organization ISIS, also known as DAESH, according to Stoltenberg. 
“We have also developed what is referred to as ‘national cyber effects,’ which is actually offensive cyber. NATO allies have used them against ISIS, or DAESH, to take down their cyber networks as part of the fight against ISIS. So we exercise, we train, we share best practices. We need to maintain our edge in the cyber domain to remain the most successful and strongest alliance in history,” Stoltenberg said. 
NATO has also prioritized increasing cooperation with non-Atlantic allies to address future needs, according to Stoltenberg. 
“We are stepping up to defend the rules-based international order by deepening our cooperation with like-minded countries and organizations, including in the Asia-Pacific,” Stoltenberg said. ”For the first time in our history, we are putting climate change and security at the core of NATO’s agenda.” 
NATO’s allies in the Asia-Pacific region include Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand. The four Pacific countries joined a NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting for the first time in December 2020. At the meeting, the countries discussed the rise of China, a persistent concern during Stoltenberg’s tenure leading the organization. 
Multilateral alliances like NATO enable their member countries to effectively confront obstacles, according to Stoltenberg. 
“None of us can face these challenges alone. No country, however big, and no continent, however rich. Neither the U.S. nor Europe alone. But in NATO we are not alone. Together we represent 30 different nations, 1 billion people, half of the world’s economic and military might, and together we are adapting to a more uncertain world,” Stoltenberg said. 
The future of global security is unpredictable, but a multilateral approach strengthens the ability to continue to respond to emergent threats, according to Stoltenberg. 
“We do not know what the next crisis will be. But we do know that whatever happens we are safer when we stand together,” Stoltenberg said.

Georgetown University students are petitioning the university to accommodate international students who need on-campus housing during winter break.
The petition, which has been signed by 54 students, urges the university to allow international students to remain in on-campus residence halls for winter break given pandemic-induced housing insecurity between Dec. 18, 2021, and Jan. 11, 2022. The university typically shuts down residence halls during winter break, barring students from returning to their dorms until the beginning of spring semester.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created travel and safety barriers that prevent international students from returning to their permanent residences, according to the petition. 
“This year has proven to be difficult for all of us. For international students, however, particular challenges remain, of which winter housing insecurities create the most burden and stress. Many of us are unable to return home this winter as the quarantine time simply exceeds our break, not to mention the difficulty in securing international flights and the continuous risk of being exposed to the virus,” the petition reads. 
Yichu Huang (SFS ’23), an international student who co-authored the petition, said students felt compelled to write the petition after the office of residential living gave unclear information.
“The emails that I received and some of the emails that my friends received from residential living had different wordings,” Huang said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “We were very confused about what the school was trying to say and I think that residential living was equally confused as well. I think it was just a few staff members having incomplete information and trying to respond to us.”
According to an email to international students obtained by The Hoya, despite the Office of Residential Living’s pressure on higher university administrators, the university does not have a plan to house international students during winter break.
“Unfortunately, even with our department’s added pressure on senior leadership, we still do not have any direction on whether campus housing options will be available to some students during winter break,” the Oct. 28 email reads. 
This year, international students may experience high travel costs and stringent quarantine requirements, according to Andrea Ho (SFS ’24), who signed the petition. 
“International students face unique challenges compared to domestic students as not all of them can return home due to factors such as high costs of travel and quarantine, complicated quarantine procedures in our home countries, and the general difficulty of procuring international flights,” Ho wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This creates a lot of stress on international students to find housing over the winter break, especially nearing finals seasons.”
The university should not expect international students to find short-term housing options for winter break, according to Huang. 
“Finding short leases in D.C. is quite hard, and even though there is the option of Airbnb, I think that with COVID being around it isn’t the safest choice,” Huang said. “It also isn’t affordable, as the price range differs a lot. There’s also a lot of transactional and organizational costs, which results in logistical difficulties.”
According to a university spokesperson, administrators are meeting with students in the coming days to discuss options for international students. 
“We understand the concern around winter housing and have a meeting scheduled with student leaders this week to discuss the issue further with them,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We hope to communicate with all on-campus students as soon as we’re able.”
On Nov. 8, the United States lifted international travel bans put in place in February and March 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic; travelers can now enter the United States with proof of full vaccination. However, other countries still have precautions and mandatory quarantines in place. For instance, as of Nov. 8, China requires all travelers to quarantine for 14 days upon entering the country.
Additionally, many international students are likely to face difficulties securing housing over the winter break, according to Kelly He (MSB ’23), who conducted a survey of approximately 50 international students. He found that 84% of participants reported a desire to stay in their on-campus residence during winter break. 
Ho said she hopes the petition will raise awareness for issues international students face on campus. 
“I really hope the administration can look into this matter and assist international students even if it decides to shut campus down,” Ho wrote. “Many international students have worked so hard for an opportunity to study in the US and it’s awful when they’re neglected by the administration in crucial decisions that involve them.” 
Huang said she would like to see a response from the university about housing for international students. 
“My genuine hope is that they would give us a clear response, whether that be a yes or no. I would want a definite answer, and that is the most important thing I am looking for,” Huang said. “Vague wording at this time of year would be very frustrating.”

A Georgetown University professor testified for the second time at a people’s tribunal investigating the Chinese government’s ongoing human rights abuses against Uyghurs. 
James Millward, an expert on historical and contemporary Xinjiang, testified Nov. 27 at the London-based Uyghur Tribunal as a peer reviewer of a new report based on hundreds of top secret Chinese government documents. The report, authored by Adrian Zenz, directly links China’s crackdown on Uyghurs and other ethnic groups to speeches from high-level Chinese leadership.
Peer reviewing the report included examining and verifying the documents, considering Zenz’s argument and verifying his translations, according to Millward. These secret documents demonstrate intent from the upper echelons of the Chinese government — including President Xi Jinping — for policies later imposed in the Uyghur region, Millward said.
“In these speeches and other things that are in these documents, he identifies the problem as religion and extremist thinking, and he says that that needs to be the focus of any kind of solution,” Millward said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “And the camps have been created and the re-education system put in place to address things in people’s minds — or things that the Chinese state imagines are in everyone’s minds, if they’re religious.” 
Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, also testified for the second time Nov. 27 on his new report. The Uyghur Tribunal asked him in September to review the documents after an anonymous source leaked them to the tribunal. 
The Uyghur Tribunal is an independent people’s tribunal investigating China’s alleged genocide and other atrocities against Uyghurs and other Turkic and/or majority-Muslim ethnic groups. The tribunal will issue its determination Dec. 9 on whether China has perpetrated genocide and other atrocities against Uyghurs. 
Established in September 2020, the tribunal held hearings in June, September and November 2021, at which witnesses — including victims, human rights activists, and academics — provided evidence of China’s abuses. Millward also testified at the September hearings as an expert on the region. 
The Chinese government has persecuted these ethnic groups for decades, but repression has drastically increased since 2017 under the guise of combating religious extremism. China’s campaign includes severe restrictions on religious practice; repressive population control policies, including forced sterilization; arbitrary detention of over 1 million individuals, mainly Uyghurs; and widespread forced labor, among other crimes. The United States condemned the crisis as genocide and crimes against humanity in January. 
The New York Times first reported on the cache of documents in question — known as the Xinjiang Papers — in 2019, but most of the documents were never made public. 
After reviewing the documents, Zenz and Millward concluded they are far more significant than previously believed. 
The documents, which include top-secret speeches from Xi, provide substantial evidence connecting the crackdown in the Uyghur region to central government demands, especially related to so-called “re-education” camps and population control, according to the report. 
“Xi’s statements that religious extremism is like a ‘powerful psychedelic drug’ and that acts of terror will ‘multiply like cancer cells’ if extremist thought is not eradicated are quoted verbatim (and attributed to Xi) in a widely cited March 2017 government document that likens re-education to free medical treatment for ‘sick thinking,’” the report reads.
That chilling, medical rhetoric has been part of this campaign since the very beginning, Millward said.
“That echoes dehumanizing and scientific and other kinds of rhetoric from the Holocaust and other episodes of genocide in the past,” Millward said. 
If the Uyghur Tribunal concludes that China has perpetrated genocide, it will hopefully prompt the international community to take greater action to combat Beijing’s abuses, according to Rushan Abbas, founder of Campaign for Uyghurs, a nongovernmental organization that advocates for Uyghur human rights. 
“One of the biggest successes of the tribunal was its ability to gather a significant amount of evidence in the face of obfuscation and propaganda by the Chinese government,” Abbas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Nations will be able to look to that body of evidence to make determinations about what can be done to end this atrocity.”
Abbas, whose sister is detained in the Uyghur region, testified in June at the Uyghur Tribunal. 
The Uyghur Tribunal is especially significant because China is blocking substantial action at the United Nations level, according to Millward.
“These kinds of organizations and initiatives, such as the Uyghur Tribunal, by the very fact that they aren’t state led, are very powerful,” Millward said. “What we’re hearing here is the voice of people organizing outside of the network of states. And so that’s where the import lies.”

Georgetown’s Center for Jewish Civilization hosted an event for International Holocaust Remembrance Day to commemorate the six million Jewish people and other minority groups who were killed in the Holocaust.
The virtual event, held on Jan. 25 and titled “The Holocaust and Genocide: Memorialization and Activism,” was led by University of Edinburgh professor Donald Bloxham, who specializes in mass atrocities studies. The event focused on atrocities of the Holocaust, relationships between memorial and activist approaches to the Holocaust and the parallels to recent genocidal events in countries around the world. The discussion was moderated by Professor Anna Sommer, an Associate Director and professor at the Center for Jewish Civilization. 
Bloxham said although the Holocaust is often singled out from other genocides, the world must continue to remember its abhorrent events. 
“It is very unusual even amongst genocides and this is therefore supposed to do something to the world. We need to remember it not just for its own sake, but because remembering it will somehow help us as moral agents in the world in whatever way that might be,” Bloxham said at the event.
Antisemitism is still widely prevalent in western society, according to Bloxham.  
“I do think that in western civilization antisemitism is entrenched so deeply,” Bloxham said. “I think it’s very difficult to say that the advances that have been made in some countries as regards to ending antisemitism — it’s difficult to say that they’re not reversible because they clearly are and the abiding stereotypes of Jews and anti-jewish thinking is present.”
Antisemitic attacks have risen across the United States and the world since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the past year, nearly one in four Jewish Americans have reported facing antisemitism.  
Studying the Holocaust can help identify and prevent future atrocities, according to Bloxham.   
“One can detect the connection between the growing interest in hands-on, neighbor-on-neighbor violence of the Holocaust in the killing fields of Eastern Europe that began in the nineties and the similar violence of the Rwandan and Yugoslavian genocides of the same decade,” Bloxham said at the event. “The study of the sexual violence of those recent genocides has also gone alongside a growing in the issue of the Nazi.” 
During the Rwandan genocide, women were subjected to sexual assualt by the Hutu militia groups, who were encourged to commit acts of sexual violence. In the Yugoslavian genocide sexual violence was widespread, and the majority of these victims were Bonsian Muslims.  
Events of mass genocide, including the Holocaust, frequently follow similar patterns of development and have historically comparable agendas. In the 1994 Rwandan genocide, armed militias slaughtered nearly one million people belonging to the ethnic Tutsi population in the country. Similarly, the Bosnian genocide saw the systemic murder of 100,000 Bosnian Muslim and Croatian civilians by the Bosnian Serb forces backed by the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army in the 1990s.
It is critical to realize genocides are not isolated issues and impact the treatment of future populations, according to Bloxham.
r
Bloxham said he is discouraged by the lack of awareness of recent genocides.
“It’s become a very safe, very easy topic because Holocaust deniers are absolutely marginalized — quite rightly. There’s no one out there saying that the Holocaust is a good thing or a justifiable thing,” Bloxham said. “Its not like, in that sense, the Armenian genocide where you’ve got deniers and people justifying — there’s none of that.” 
Currently, there are a number of countries under Genocide Watch, including China for committing atrocities against Uyghurs and other minority ethnic groups. Turkey, Syria and Iraq, where the Kurdish minority population is considered to be at risk of genocide under the authority of the regional powers, are also listed.
Bloxham also commemorated the non-Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
“In some of these instances, some of the things closest to the Holocaust, i.e. other groups persecuted and murdered by the Nazis, have sort of been removed out of the picture. Yet, we’re also supposed to be looking at the Holocaust as a way to something much bigger and more significant and more general and often further detached from the Holocaust: general issues of human rights abuses in the world today,” Bloxham said.
An estimated five million non-Jewish people were victims of the Holocaust. The groups targeted included Roma people, people with disabilities, Jehovah’s Witnesses and gay people. 
Bloxham urged individuals to remember all victims of the Holocaust and to work toward preventing future atrocities.
“I also want to think about another kind of duality, not quite an opposition, but what we might call on the one hand the relationship between thinking about the Holocaust’s intrinsic significance and thinking about its instrumental significance. By instrumental, I mean really its significance for helping us think about other things.” Bloxham said.

Professors at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service (SFS) were appointed to the Biden administration’s Defense Policy Board.
The Defense Policy Board, a subset of the U.S. Department of Defense below the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy made up of 19 members, provides informed advice to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. New appointees to the board include former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Victor Cha, vice dean for faculty and graduate affairs and holder of the D.S. Song-Korea Foundation Endowed Chair in the department of government and SFS; and Michael O’Hanlon, professor in the Center for Security Studies and senior fellow and director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. 
Former Secretary of State Albright was sworn in as chair for the board in Nov. 2021 after being removed from the board by the Trump administration a year earlier. 
The Defense Policy Board provides an opportunity for independent, private citizens to provide expertise and perspective to assist the Secretary of Defense in defense policy decision making, according to O’Hanlon.
“Based on the first meeting, and based on my expectations of what this kind of a board can usefully accomplish, I will use words like friendly skeptic, tough love and second set of eyes to convey the notion of a group of individuals that would like to see Secretary Austin and the United States and the Department of Defense do well, but may or may not agree with him on everything, may or may not agree with each other on everything, but still are hopeful there’s some utility in the group getting together,” O’Hanlon said in an interview with The Hoya.
Though the U.S. should remain apprehensive of other threats, the most concerning matter in defense policy for the Biden administration is dealing with Russia and China, according to O’Hanlon.
“The whole point here is to try to bear in mind that the world does interfere with your plans and your strategies,” O’Hanlon said. “The idea that you might think Russia and China should be your main concerns, but something else changes that dynamic altogether — that’s always a possibility. At a purely conceptual and historical level, I would say that those are the two greatest concerns, and they will remain that.”
Cha has been a member of the Georgetown faculty since 1995 and has taught a broad range of courses in international relations, foreign policy and Asian studies. He is also currently the senior vice president and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.
Cha hopes to work alongside fellow Defense Policy Board members to provide advice to U.S. Department of Defense officials.
“It’s an honor to serve on the DPB and humbling to do so under the leadership of Secretary Albright. The purpose of the DPB is to provide advice to the senior leadership of the Pentagon and there is no better senior statesperson to do that than Secretary Albright. I hope to support her and the DPB in any way that I can,” Cha wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Albright, along with teaching courses in diplomacy at Georgetown in the SFS, is chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, part of Dentons Global Advisors, and Albright Capital Management LLC. She also chairs the National Democratic Institute, serves as the president of the Truman Scholarship Foundation and is honorary co-chair of the World Refugee Council.
Georgetown is proud to see its professors serve as real-world leaders in foreign policy, according to Joel Hellman, dean of the SFS.
“SFS faculty live our SFS values through their commitment to public service,” Hellman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We welcome the appointment of such accomplished professors as Victor and Michael O’Hanlon to the Defense Policy Board. They represent the best of SFS.”

A new grant will allow the Asian Studies and the African Studies programs to collaborate in researching and discussing diplomacy, trade and development between the two regions. 
The Africa-China Initiative, a joint project funded by a $50,000 year-long grant from the Henry Luce Foundation, will offer a series of coordinated events geared toward members of the Georgetown community, policymakers and the public. The events will consist of speakers with expertise in Africa-China affairs. The program will also oversee the creation of a policy working group composed of experts in the field.  
The state of international politics makes it impossible to separate the two regions from one another, making increased joint research on Africa-China relations a priority, according to Helena Kolanda, director of the Asia Program at the Henry Luce Foundation.
“One can’t think about China and the United States in a bilateral context anymore,” Kolanda said in an interview with The Hoya. “Both countries are global powers and have connections and impact all over the world. Part of the interest in this initiative was the fact that it was going to be working across the China-Africa, Africa-China space.”
The goal of the speaker series and the policy group is to clarify the narrative surrounding Africa and China, according to Yoon Jung Park, professor in the African Studies Program and program director of the Africa-China Initiative. 
“Both of these activities ultimately have the aim of correcting some of the misconceptions, myths, and rumors around Africa-China engagements and foregrounding African views and experiences,” Park wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The events will be co-sponsored by other Georgetown departments, as well as external partners like Howard University’s Center for African Studies, and will consist of speakers with expertise in Africa-China affairs. Additionally, the policy working group will conduct outreach to targeted policymakers and practitioners. 
The significance of cooperating on African and Asian studies is that stereotypes will be corrected, according to Park. 
“We want to ensure that our audiences are aware that there are multiple perspectives and priorities that may not necessarily align with US- or European-centered views,” Park wrote. “As Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche has stated, there is much more than ‘a single story.’”
Adiche is an author and speaker from Nigeria who has delivered two popular TED Talks, “The Danger of a Single Story” in 2009 and “We Should All Be Feminists” in 2012. The former focuses on dispelling the monolithic view that all Africans have the same story, something that the Africa-China Initiative aims to correct. 
By engaging in joint research and discussions through the Africa-China Initiative, studies in each individual region will be strengthened, according to Michael Green, director of the Asian Studies Program.
“We can learn quite a bit about the variables shaping China’s development approaches going forward by appreciating the agency of African leaders and citizens,” Green wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This will also help us broaden our study of global China, and the interaction of China with other major powers like Japan or France in outside of the usual East Asian and European areas of focus.” 
Similarly, the joint program will explain China’s policies and engagement in Africa through a lens that takes African perspectives into account, according to Park.  
“African agency is another topic that has received quite a lot of attention in recent years,” Park wrote. “My own area of work focuses on migration and race relations, both in African countries and in China; we will explore this as another possible panel or roundtable event.”
According to Kolanda, the Africa-China Initiative will offer valuable perspectives by expanding its participants beyond academia.  
“Knowledge is not the purview of academics alone,” Kolanda told The Hoya. “There are practitioners in the NGO sector, civil society, business and government who are all touching upon these issues and have knowledge that needs to be shared.”

Several students have signed a letter demanding Georgetown University investigate its endowment to screen for the presence of ties to human rights abuses in China. 
The Jan. 23 letter, titled “An Open Letter Calling for Divestment from Ongoing Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity,” calls on Georgetown University to divest the university’s endowment from companies that are linked to the repression and forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in China. The letter was co-authored by the Muslim Student Association (MSA) and the Hong Kong Student Association (HKSA), alongside individual students from across the campus community.  
Georgetown has a duty to investigate any potential financial holdings related to the Chinese government’s abuse of Uyghurs, according to Christopher Boose (COL ’22), who helped to prepare the original letter.
“Even if the University thinks its investments are clean, they have a duty to check and publicly commit themselves against the Uyghur genocide,” Boose wrote to The Hoya. “At a school as proud of its values as Georgetown, there’s no excuse for not taking a stand on an issue as fundamental as genocide.” 
The letter was modeled after similar demands by students at the Catholic University of America, according to Boose, who also said students at universities across the country have also called upon their respective schools to cut financial ties with Uyghur human rights abuses. 
The Chinese government has persecuted Uyghurs and other Turkic, Muslim-majority groups for decades in the Uyghur Region, which the Chinese government refers to as Xinjiang. China’s current policies include the arbitrary detention of up to one million people, mainly Uyghurs, severe restrictions on religious practice and repressive population control, including forced sterilization. Hundreds of international companies — including Apple and Microsoft, which Georgetown holds stock in — are at a high risk of taking part in the forced labor of Uyghurs. 
Georgetown has a moral responsibility to divest and ensure it’s endowment is not tied to genocide, according to John Metz, executive director of the Athenai Institute, a bi-partisan student-led non-profit that seeks to limit Beijing’s influence on U.S. college campuses. The institute helped prepare the Georgetown letter. 
“Divestment is a practical and moral necessity,” Metz wrote in an email to The Hoya. “By divesting, Georgetown has an opportunity to ensure its financial independence from a genocidal regime.”
The letter also urges the university to promote research and dialogue on the human rights crisis facing Uyghurs. Alongside the co-authoring student organizations, original sponsors of the letter include the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition (GBC), Georgetown University College Republicans (GUCR) and Georgetown University College Democrats (GUCD). 
The university should consider human rights in all of its investments, according to a statement from the HKSA board. 
“We encourage the University to consider the human rights implications of all its investments, programs, and activities — whether this be in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, or anywhere else in the world,” the HKSA statement read. 
The Muslim Student Association did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment. 
Georgetown students should support efforts to investigate the endowment, according to Matteo Caulfield (COL ’23), president of GBC. 
“Holding China accountable for its violations of basic human rights is a cause we should all get behind no matter our political background in the United States,” Caulfield wrote to The Hoya. “As Georgetown students, we have the responsibility to reflect on our global impact and eradicate any connection we bear to international crimes.”
The Georgetown University Student Association (GUSA) Senate unanimously passed a resolution at a meeting held Jan. 31 requesting the university to provide more transparency about the endowment. 
GUSA Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24), who co-sponsored the resolution after signing onto the letter, said any ties to the Chinese government’s atrocities against the Uyghurs is unacceptable. 
“This issue is important to me because as a Jewish American, I firmly believe that no ethnic group should ever face an attempt to eliminate it. I believe that the Chinese government’s behavior points to that direction,” Gordon wrote to The Hoya. 
It’s essential that students raise this issue whenever possible because a sustained dialogue will be critical to find ways to respond to these atrocities, according to Peter Irwin, a senior program officer at the Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group the Uyghur Human Rights Project.
“The first step for Georgetown — or any institution for that matter — would be to meticulously review their investments to ensure there is no connection to the treatment of Uyghurs,” Irwin wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The composition of endowments sends a message, according to Jeffrey Ngo (GRD ’24), a doctoral candidate studying history, who signed the letter.  
“How an educational institution allocates its endowment sends a powerful message about the social values it endorses,” Ngo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our university community is diverse. Many members — including Hong Kongers like me — are directly facing the repression of the Chinese government every single day.”  
Human rights and values already guide Georgetown’s investment practices, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Georgetown’s Socially Responsible Investing Policy (SRI Policy) aligns the university’s investments to protecting human life and dignity, as well as social justice and the promotion of the common good,” the spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The SRI policy, which was put into effect in June 2017, was established by these guidelines, according to the spokesperson. 
The push for the university to investigate the endowments offers students the ability to protest the actions of the Chinese government within the campus community, according to Ngo.
“The divestment campaign offers a potential for me to make an impact for a cause that’s personal to me — in this case, protesting genocide perpetuated by the Chinese government against Uyghurs in Xinjiang — while focusing on my own university community. That’s why I’m doing my part to push the letter forward by signing it and spreading it,” Ngo wrote.

CW: This article references racist statements. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
Students are calling on the Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) to address racism on its campus after a professor referred to a student using an anti-Asian slur. 
Professor Franz Werro used the slur in his class on Feb. 10. In response, the GULC Asian Pacific American Law Students Association (APALSA) and the Georgetown China Law Society (GCLS) co-wrote a letter, which has been signed by over 500 students, addressed to Dean William Treanor, which they subsequently circulated across the GULC community. The letter included a list of action items for university administrators to address Werro’s racist language and protect students. 
In the Feb. 16 letter, APALSA and GCLS condemned Werro’s language and urged the university to allow AAPI students who are uncomfortable remaining in the class to switch into alternative courses. 
“The use of a slur in class erodes the trust students can have in their instructor. When that slur is directed at one student, it is deeply alarming and degrading to all students in the class,” the letter reads. “Students should have the choice not to have to learn from someone who makes them feel lesser.”
The letter also calls on the administration to discipline staff and faculty after reported incidents, create an anonymous complaint channel and hold mandatory implicit bias training at the school.
GULC has been administering implicit bias training for faculty and plans to schedule future discussions on bias with students, according to Treanor. 
Werro’s comments were deeply offensive to the Asian Pacific Islander (API) community, according to Somang Lee (LAW ’24), who signed onto the letter. 
“It hurt not just one student who was on the receiving end of that slur at that time, but also the entire community of API people on campus,” Lee said in an interview with The Hoya.
In a letter to the GULC community, Werro apologized and said he understood the harm his words caused.
“In class on Thursday, I addressed a student using a term that I now understand is a racial slur that has long been used to degrade and diminish Chinese people in particular and people of Asian descent generally,” Werro wrote. “I recognize that my use of that word caused real hurt and pain for many people in the Georgetown community and beyond. I am deeply sorry.” 
Werro, a native French speaker, told The Hoya that he was not aware of the historical context of the English term he had used.
“I used what I thought was the English translation of a term I would have used in French — my mother tongue — and which has no pejorative meaning in that language, such as Frenchman or Englishman,” Werro wrote in a statement to The Hoya. 
Werro also told The Hoya he plans to learn about the history of racism in the United States to create a more supportive learning environment for his students in the future.  
The United States has a long history of anti-Asian racism, stemming from bigotry towards Asian American immigrants who traveled to the United States in the 19th century. Europe also has a history of racism against those of Asian descent, including a jump in hate crimes against those of Asian descent during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The incident is the newest addition in a pattern of racist incidents involving GULC faculty and staff. Last month, GULC placed incoming administrator Ilya Shapiro on administrative leave following his racist and sexist tweets about President Joe Biden’s commitment to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court. 
In March 2021, GULC fired Sandra Sellers after she complained about the academic performance of Black students to fellow professor David Batson. The racist remarks were caught on video, and Batson resigned following Sellers’ termination. 
GULC is committed to ensuring an inclusive learning environment for all students, according to GULC Dean William Treanor. 
“Last night I was made aware of an incident yesterday involving a professor using a derogatory term in the classroom that is demeaning and hurtful. This term is a slur with a centuries-long history of harm to Asian people,” Treanor wrote in the email. “As a community of students, staff, and faculty we must take a look at our culture, structure, systems, and processes to ensure that we are a community that fosters respect, equity, and justice.” 
In their letter, APALSA criticized Treanor’s Feb. 11 message for not specifying that the slur was used to address a student and did not include Werro’s name. 
While APALSA wrote that they appreciated Werro’s apology, the group found it insufficient, especially his commitment to learn more about the history of discrimination and bias against Asian Americans.  
“Anti-Asian racism is prevalent globally, including across Europe, and even if Professor Werro was unaware of the world’s history, it is inappropriate for a professor to address a student by their perceived race,” the letter reads. 
GULC is taking steps to create a more inclusive and welcoming campus environment, Treanor told The Hoya.
“The work of creating a truly diverse and inclusive community is an ongoing effort and one to which I am deeply committed,” Treanor wrote. “We are taking a number of important steps to fulfill our goal of building a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive campus environment.” 
Lee hopes GULC administrators will reflect on this incident and finally begin to address systemic issues at the school.
“I hope for the administration to really be listening to the voices of the student affinity groups and acknowledge this as a very long front issue and be willing to continue conversations,” Lee said. “Not just about this incident, but for the years to come.”

The Muslim Law Students Association (MLSA) wrote a letter Feb. 28 to Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) administrators calling for action to address one professor’s racist and Islamophobic class conduct.  
The letter — which has garnered signatures from 286 Georgetown students, almost 30 student organizations and 24 non-GULC bar associations as of March 3 — asks for increased administrative representation and curriculum changes. The letter describes discriminatory conduct toward Muslim students by Susan Deller Ross, a tenured professor who teaches courses in international and comparative law on women’s human rights and is the director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic. 
The authors of the letter, which were a group of MLSA members, gathered information from decades of coursework in Ross’ classes, citing dozens of excerpts from the required textbook she authored and exam questions she wrote. The authors wrote that the content they gathered represents a holistic picture of Ross’ racist and Islamophobic beliefs. 
The letter requests that Ross’ course curriculum be modified and reviewed by a Muslim expert, according to Hamsa Fayed (LAW ’23), a member of MLSA.
“It is quite clear from our 17-page memo and content of our statement that Prof. Ross is not able to objectively evaluate any question relating to Muslims and their practice without injecting dangerously Islamophobic rhetoric into her teachings/examinations, thus we also ask that she refrain from the use of those topics in her class lectures and examinations,” Fayed wrote to The Hoya.
MLSA’s demands include mandating anti-Islamophobia and anti-discrimination specific training for all GULC faculty, reserving a seat for an MLSA representative on the committee that appoints GULC faculty, and creating a clear and direct internal system for students to anonymously file complaints for the administration to investigate.
Past coursework that MLSA marked as promoting islamophobic rhetoric included a 2020 exam that asked students to advocate for the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), an extremist right-wing party responsible for mass lynchings of Muslims in India and Kashmir. 
The exam question distressed and harmed many students, according to MLSA member Maheen Haq (LAW ’23).
“How do you expect someone like a Muslim person to take that exam?” Haq said in an interview with The Hoya. “Members of my family have died and you’d be expected to take this exam and advocate on behalf of a party that has done lynchings of your community.”
Ross said her coursework does not specifically target Muslim students and focuses on international and human rights law.
“My courses and casebook sections concerning discrimination against women in marriage,
divorce, and inheritance cover many statutes, whether they stem from the Catholic, Protestant, 
Mormon, Jewish, Muslim, or Hindu religion or from ethnic customs or from cultural beliefs that 
women should be subordinate to men,” Ross wrote to The Hoya. “I am not against any religion or ethnicity.”
Being forced to argue on behalf of Islamophobic laws and rules, as the letter states Ross encourages students to do in the clinic, could cause students to begin applying those ideas to their careers and lives, Haq said.  
“This will influence your policy choices, it’s going to influence how you do so many different things,” Haq said. “For example, she asked students to advocate against the right for women to wear a hijab, and she taught students how to use international doctrines and treaties to make that argument. That’s just sick.”
Fayed felt as though she had to act against her beliefs and morals in order to perform well in Ross’ clinic, according to a video posted on the GULC MLSA instagram page.
“This all really tore me apart after a while especially since a lot of those stances were fundamentally against my belief systems and my identity as a human rights advocate,” Fayed said in the video. “I was ashamed of myself, ashamed to call myself an advocate for social justice, ashamed to be a Muslim, ashamed that I wasn’t defending myself as a proud Muslim, ashamed of what I had enabled from being silent, ashamed that I feared speaking out because I was the only one in the room that felt this way, ashamed that those fellow students would invalidate me because I was a nobody in comparison to the decorated and accomplished professor Susan Ross.”  
Jinan Chehade (LAW ’23), another member of MLSA who raised concerns about Ross’ insensitive course content alongside Haq, said the administration did not provide an adequate response.
GULC prioritizes making classrooms inclusive environments with respectful dialogue, according to William Treanor, dean of GULC.
“We received the letter and have been in touch with the student leaders and individuals involved,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown Law is committed to ensuring an inclusive campus that welcomes students of all backgrounds.”
MLSA’s letter follows a series of student activism against racist conduct from faculty members at GULC. The GULC administration placed Ilya Shapiro, a prospective administrator, on administrative leave Jan. 31 pending investigation from the Law Center following racist and sexist tweets about President Biden’s pledge to nominate the first Black female Supreme Court justice. The decision followed a Jan. 28 statement released by the Georgetown Law Black Law Student Association (Georgetown BLSA), urging GULC to to rescind Shapiro’s job offer, commit to a more thorough hiring process, properly staff the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, ensure the representation of Black students when it comes to hiring decisions and fund an endowment to support Black GULC students. 
Professor Franz Werro referred to a student Feb. 10 using an anti-Asian slur, prompting the GULC Asian Pacific American Law Students Association (APALSA) and the Georgetown China Law Society (GCLS) to urge the GULC to hold mandatory implicit bias training for professors and to discipline staff and faculty. In March 2021, Black students and faculty at GULC demanded institutional change after a viral video captured professor Sandra Sellers making racist comments about Black students in her course.
In light of recent controversies at GULC, as well as Ross’ course and clinic, some members of MLSA ask that Islam be taught within accurate and objective contexts at GULC, according to Fayed.
“We want her course curriculums to be modified to be more sensitive to POC cultures and the Islamic faith through the use of a Muslim expert to review the curriculum,” Fayed wrote.
Haq said she ultimately decided to forfeit the opportunity to learn in a clinic she is interested in because of the racism she found in Ross’ curriculum. According to Haq, she is not the only Muslim student who was hesitant to participate in Ross’ course or clinic.  
Nearly 50% of Muslims living in the United States experienced some form of discrimination in the past year, including being treated with suspicion, called offensive names and singled out by law enforcement, according to 2017 data from the Pew Research Center. 
MLSA’s letter also demands that Ross’ grading systems change so that personal biases cannot influence student grades, according to Fayed.
“What we are asking for is simple: removing Prof. Ross from any student evaluation position where her biases and prejudices would negatively affect POC and Muslim students,” Fayed wrote. “The non-blinding grading system does not protect POC and Muslim students at all from Prof. Ross’s inherent prejudices and racism.”
Chehade said that the Islamophobic tactics Ross uses in her curriculum would result in further discrimination if left unchecked by the university.
“It really starts here in the classroom, when we continue to be silent about these blatant forms of racism, when we continue to be passive and say, ‘This is normal,’” Chehade said.

I happen to know Professor Ross and know she’s absolutely against bigotry & religious intolerance. When Trump was running for office and proposed the Muslim ban she was horrified. She’s against practices that subjugate & harm women. That’s her passion. Not hatred. The students go speak with her directly about what they see as bias, discuss how they see the issues, and both parties can try to better understand each other. It’s cruel to paint her in this light, as she’s spent her long career trying to better the lives of many people, Muslims included.

“Students leads charge against female professor (and director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic) for teaching women’s rights material” is  playing differently in the campus press than one would have imagined. 
Of course anyone who was offended by the way Professor Ross teaches her class should be heard. I hope this professor takes this feedback in good faith and reassesses whether she is presenting culturally sensitive material in a sophisticated way.
But of course, the men who run Georgetown should stand up for the right of an accomplished feminist professors to speak about women’s rights, and ignore this outrageous demand to submit her writings to the approval of religious authorities.
And, setting subjective experiences for the moment, the rest of this complaint is absurd. Any decent law student should be able to see through it.
The supposedly offensive exam questions? They’re all extremely normal legal case questions, in which students are challenged to explain how they would represent a particular client taking a particular stand on a women’s rights issue. Yes, some of these stands are controversial, like the French ban on wearing religious dress in classrooms. But don’t Georgetown Law students realize that, as aspiring lawyers, they may need to represent clients who hold controversial positions, even some they may not agree with? Don’t they understand that learning how to do that is … the point of law school? 
The answer, I think, is that they do understand, but they are trying to make mountains out of molehills to tar a professor who (understandably) rubbed them the wrong way by loudly and unapologetically standing up for women’s rights around the world. They’re entitled to their discomfort, but if they don’t recognize the regressive precedent they are trying to set, I hope Georgetown Law leadership does.

This sounds like a personal attack by Haq and Fayed. Do they really think anywhere in America that a university is going to submit a syllabus to a “Muslim expert” for review before teaching. I you think that is going to happen, then GULC or for than matter any American University is not for them. In addition to the separation of church and state there is a concept called academic freedom that allows professors to address issues that are of consequence, and that does includes religions. Religious wars have been the most heinous events in history, murdering people in untold numbers for some infraction against the belief. And its not just wars, it is the day to day religious oppression of those who choose not to comply or voice an opposition. If Haq and Fayed don’t think that is a subject they can intellectually discuss, then perhaps they either don’t have the intellectual capacity to engage in debate, or they are themselves such zealots demanding ‘their rights’ be accommodated they do not belong in the legal profession. GULC has a diversity of students wanting to become lawyers. If Haq and Fayed cannot articulate a position that shows where Ross is violating a law in her teachings, then perhaps they are not suited to the legal profession. I certainly wouldn’t want to find out a lawyer I’ve  hired to defend me would let religion or anything else stand the way of a full throated defense. 
This foolish complaint should be dismissed. And if the complainants are not satisfied, perhaps they should be as well.

No aspect of the comments in support of the professor make sense.  Here is an example of why. According to Donald Trump, those persons — especially Blacks who accused him of being a racist — were the real racists.  Those who supported him not only agreed, but also supported and defended Trump.  Who were these persons?  Many were white nationalists.
I believe the students.  First, Muslims in professional school tend to aspire to just fit in, integrate into their academic settings, and avoid virtually anything that would bring attention to them.  They usually quietly endure institutional insults and encourage other to do the same.  They endure harms. They don’t raise controversy.  Rarely will they respond with demands, sans instances when they seek to address a material harm. 
Second, the professor’s assignments are both unusual and unbalancing. A core principal of legal training is teach a student to, “argue both sides”.  This is not just the practice of law school, but also one of its mandates.  Related, for examination and papers, students are asked to weigh the merits of both side and reach a conclusion. These exercises can be fun because they stimulate debate and students’ knowledge of a subject matter. 
Never, not ever should a law professor instruct a student to argue against the religious or cultural practices of a people — especially if those persons are either Muslim or Jewish.  To do so is an abjectly racist practice.  For certain, the exercise itself is intended to cause harm.
The student’s response was moderated. They expressed their harm and, “proffered” an occasion for Susan Ross, and indeed GT Law, to make amends.  I especially applaud their efforts because, even after being harmed, they only sought that their law school fix things going forward.  
Georgetown U Law is now at a place where it can right a wrong.  It should suspend Ross from teaching.  It may seek to get her placed at a law school in Israel. There, her anti-Muslim speech and practices will be received without controversy.  Or they can encourage her affiliated research and advocacy organisations to fire her.
The law should also undergo changes in its hiring practices.  It should encourage younger Muslim lawyers to teach at the school.  This may lead to the law school fixing the racist biases threat seem to have overwhelmed its Muslim (and, likely other) student populations.  It may also result in GT law benefitting. At a minimum, its students would learn how to argue both sides.
Having evidence of Ross’ decade long patterns of harming and speaking against the cultural and religious practices of Muslims, Georgetown need only do the right thing this time around.   Have her to step down from ever teaching students again.

Ross is a bigot in many ways.  I took her clinic in 1995 before she published her book and she took her stress out on us … esp. me.  The year before she took a year to grade a paper and look up every single footnote.  I am disabled and have an invisible disability and she told me I was “faking it.”  She even shoved me in court .. I should have had her arrested.  She never finished my recommendations, then denied my entrance to a fellowship.  Ross uses feminism to advance herself only and cares nothing about individual women or students.  She’s a terror and a nightmare and it’s a shame her reign is allowed to continue.  She is, quite simply, a terrible human being.

My post was removed.  I had Deller Ross in two classes in 94 and 95 – both were still horror stories engrained on my mind, even now.  I wrote a beautiful long paper on immigration guidelines in the US based on gender persecution and Ross tried to tear it apart – after waiting to grade it for almost a year – and her incomplete – due to her inability to grade – cost me a job offer.  Then in her clinic, she drug me all year asking me to do all kinds of extra work because I was disabled – holding my grade over my head to blackmail me to do it.  She even shoved me in court, and told me my disability was something that I was “faking.”  I should have had her arrested for assault AND filed a complaint for gender/disability bias.  Don’t be fooled by her.  She uses feminism to advance her own career while she rapes the minds and spirits of students who are different than she is – and fawns over a few select favorites.  She falls back on the notion that she is “tenured.”  I am not muslim and I would characterize her as a bigot against the disabled as well as in general an intolerant person.  She is a self-aggrandizer and creates a lot of harm in her ability to broadcast her name in the supposed “help” she has done for other women.  I would guess she has done more harm than good.  I congratulate the student above for having the nerve to speak out.  Ross is a nightmare and I am sorry to hear her reign of terror continues.  She absolutely destroyed my time at Georgetown, never got my recommendations out – and then denied me a fellowship. I have gone on to practice and was even a judge, but still carry her scars.

Keep erasing – I will keep speaking.  It’s time that that her patterns be broadcast – they go BACK DECADES.  Deller Ross has no understanding or compassion outside Title VII.

The African Studies Program (AfSP) in the Georgetown School of Foreign Service (SFS) hopes to expand its mission of international anti-racism through increased course offerings. 
The AfSp was founded by Dr. James Moone, a pastor and longtime member of the NAACP who marched alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s. The program, founded in 1980, was established for students to study the political, social and economic life across Africa and to foster an understanding and engagement of African history and contemporary life.
Today the program continues to value a focus on global equity, according to AfSP Director Lahra Smith. 
“For 42 years, our focus has been on educating our students in empirically-grounded and ethically-informed African Studies, and also in promoting and encouraging study in Africa,” Smith wrote to The Hoya. “Certainly, there are shifts that we take and responses we make to demands across the Continent and within the US and our University.”
Georgetown students receive holistic education in the regions they study which is reflected in the AfSP’s interdisciplinary curriculum that touches on a wide range of topics, AfSP Professor Ken Opalo said.
“Our mission is to train the whole person,” Opalo wrote to The Hoya. “That means that we will change when needed to meet emerging challenges and opportunities and to cater to our students’ changing interests, whether that is studying and teaching economic transformation in the region, US-China competition across Africa, or climate change.”
The AfSP recently received a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation to launch the Africa-China Initiative in partnership with the Asian Studies program. The grant allowed the two programs to collaborate in research, as well as hold discussions on diplomacy, trade and development between the two regions. 
Africa-China Initiative Director Dr. Yoon Jung Park said this collaboration presents the opportunity to explore African relations in the world at new depths. 
“Given the ongoing circulation of misinformation, like ‘debt trap diplomacy’, and heavily politicized narratives that demonize China and dismiss African agency, we feel it is imperative to educate our audiences with the complicated and nuanced realities of Africa-China engagements,” Park wrote in a statement from the SFS. 
The program looks to expand in the coming years through adding new professors to the program, offering new language classes and promoting a wider variety of study abroad locations, according to Smith. 
“We do have three years of Swahili taught now, so students can take it for their proficiency, but by expanding our offerings even more, both in Swahili and maybe eventually offering a second African language, that would enhance students knowledge of African studies, a Continent where there are 55 countries and close to 2000 languages spoken,” Smith wote. 
The French department is also recruiting professors who specialize in Francophone African Studies, according to Smith. 
Expanding study abroad programs beyond Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, Cameroon and Morocco would present students with unique research opportunities, Opalo said. 
“Africa is a continent of 55 diverse countries that present a lot of interesting learning opportunities for Georgetown University students,” Opalo wrote. “Ghana, Senegal, Zambia, Namibia, and Botswana are all interesting countries where we should be sending more Georgetown University students to study and or conduct research.” 
Despite aid from adjunct professors, more full-time core faculty members are needed to support student interest in writing theses and conducting research, Smith said. Hiring more faculty members is crucial to the expansion of the program. 
“We have other regular adjunct offerings from colleagues who work in the security sectors,” Smith wrote. “But some of these subjects, especially core history and environment courses, will require us to have full-time faculty to be effective at teaching and advising students long-term.”

China-Russia relations face unprecedented challenges amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to panelists at a March 28 event.
The event, titled “China-Russia Relations: Peers, Allies, Competitors?”, featured a conversation aimed at unpacking the dynamism, opportunities and irritants in Sino-Russian ties. 
Georgetown University’s Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues and the Asian studies program in the School of Foreign Service (SFS) co-sponsored the dialogue. Evan Medeiros, Penner Family Chair in Asian studies and senior fellow with the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues, moderated the event.
Since Russia launched an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the Chinese government has emphasized the two countries’ partnership. As recently as March 28, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov affirmed that China-Russia relations continue to be particularly strong. 
Declarations of support from the Chinese and Russian governments are rooted in ideological similarities that the two countries have shared since the Cold War, as their governments were both fundamentally opposed to Western values of democracy and capitalism, according to Joseph Torigian, an American University professor and Wilson Center fellow.
“They see an attack on traditional values in the West as something dangerous,” Torigian said at the event. “Whereas Russia and China, by protecting those values, can avoid how these democratic countries fall into what they see as a destabilizing situation. They both want to restore their past.” 
Russia and China declared a “no limits” partnership Feb. 4, promising to collaborate against the West and work together on space, climate change, artificial intelligence and control of the internet.
The document’s ambiguous language underscores the countries’ different economic positions, which leaves room for the Chinese government to withhold support for the Russian invasion, according to Elizabeth Wishnick, senior research scientist in the China and Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Division at CNA.
“It’s a normative alignment. I think they agree in terms of certain broad brushstrokes of what they would like to see, but they have different positions in the global economy. They have different desires in terms of their foreign policy aims,” Wishnick said at the event. 
According to Torigian, international economic and political pressures may force China to ultimately align with the West more than Russia.
“There’s the added element of the years leading up to the Ukraine crisis, during which I think the Chinese did hope for a better relationship with the West,” Torigian said. “Since that didn’t happen, as they’re calculating their interest with regards to how much to support the Russians, and they think about what might be possible, now that the United States is prioritizing the war in Ukraine so much, they may not feel that the need to work with the Russians is costing them so much as to with regards to the west.”
However, despite the fact that China is facing backlash for supporting Russia, the China-Russia partnership ultimately benefits China’s position in the international order, according to Wishnick.
“There’ve been a lot of questions, you know, is this partnership, it might be unlimited, but is it an unlimited burden for China right now, because of additional costs that China is experiencing for being the strategic partner of Russia?” Wishnick said. “China still sees that as an asset. There’s some stability in this partnership, despite the huge pressures the Ukraine war has caused.”
People should pay attention to China and Russia’s actions, especially in the context of the conflict in Ukraine, according to Yu Bin, professor emeritus at Wittenberg University and senior fellow of the Shanghai Association of American Studies and the Russian Studies Center of the East China Normal University in Shanghai. 
“The narrative versus interest — this is the very important issue, and how much the Chinese would continue the normal commercial interaction with Russia, and to what extent, for example, the Chinese would go for any military assistance,” Bin said. “My own sense of the issue is, I think the normal, ongoing commercial interactions will continue, though the Chinese firms have been more careful not to step beyond the U.S. red line. And that’s that.”

Chaia Tacos, a popular vegetarian and vegan taco restaurant in the Georgetown neighborhood, returned to the Georgetown University Farmers’ Market in honor of Earth Day.
Chaia originated as a stand at the GU Farmers’ Market in 2013, workshopping ideas with students before opening its flagship store in Georgetown in 2015. Chaia’s mission aligns with sustainability, composting and reducing the consumption of red meat to protect the environment. 
At Chaia’s pop-up stand at the GU Farmers’ Market on April 20, the restaurant offered free tacos to Georgetown students and a giveaway raffle featuring T-shirts, gift cards and a free taco experience for six guests. 
Chaia co-founder Suzanne Simon said the farmers market stand honors the role Georgetown students play in supporting the restaurant.
“We thought it would be a great opportunity to do a giveaway of tacos to acknowledge and appreciate all of the students who often come to us,” Simon told The Hoya. “I think you all are a group of mindful consumers. Students are such an important part of a lot of the small businesses in Georgetown.”
In addition to Georgetown, Chaia has locations in Chinatown and Bethesda, Md. 
The return to the GU Farmers’ Market is a full-circle moment for Chaia in terms of the restaurant’s pursuit of sustainable food options, according to Simon.
“We started at the farmers market, and that’s how we tested our concept,” Simon said. “So coming back here feels like going back to our roots and kind of making that connection again, of the importance of not only knowing where your food comes from, but also the variety in what you’re eating.”
Chaia was a pioneer in offering sustainable food options in the District and hopes to continue this through the help of Georgetown students, according to Juan Dromgoole, Chaia’s director of operations.
“I do believe we were trendsetters before this was a thing in D.C.,” Dromgoole told The Hoya. “We want to be here for visibility, about trying to get the new generation of Hoyas to come to our restaurant and let them know that we are a cool, sustainable restaurant in Georgetown they can easily walk to.” 
Chaia partners with local farmers to ensure customers’ food comes directly from organic, homegrown sources, according to the restaurant’s website. 
Furthermore, all of the business packaging is compostable and the restaurant is dedicated to creating little to no food waste, according to Dromgoole. 
“All of our vegetables are locally sourced, our packaging is compostable, everything we give to the customer is compostable. We really do think about using every single part of the vegetable so we create little to no waste.”
According to Simon, the Georgetown neighborhood community allows local residents and tourists to visit and provide support for many small businesses, including Chaia.
“Having that mix of different types of businesses within this community is really important,” Simon said. “The small businesses are often the ones that really give back the most to the community.” 
Chaia hopes to make customers think about their meat consumption and the possibilities for sustainable eating, according to Simon.
“You don’t always have to go to a place that has meat,” Simon said. “You can enjoy a meal that’s meatless. If everyone started to think a little bit more consciously about eating just a little less meat, then that’s a big impact we can have for the planet.” 
Beef production accounts for between 7% and 18% of global methane emissions, with plant-based options providing an environmentally conscious alternative, according to the World Wildlife Fund. 
Carolina Oxenstierna (SFS ’25), who got a taco at the give away at the GU Farmers’ Market, said Chaia is one of the best restaurants in Georgetown to get a healthy and sustainable meal. 
“Chaia is vegan and vegetarian — very healthy, organic products,” Oxenstierna told The Hoya. “They’re one of my favorite places to go because it’s really healthy, and their products are sustainable, which is really important as well.”
According to Dromgoole, Earth Day is an important time for Chaia to recognize the role it can play in promoting sustainability. 
“We really do care about sustainability,” Dromgoole said. “Hopefully, people know the value of those little things that we do that actually take a lot of time on our end, but we do care about those things. It’s important to us to show that Earth Day is something to be celebrated, and we want to be a part of that.”

Tourism numbers are on their way back up to pre-pandemic levels, according to a recent report by Destination DC (DDC), the official marketing arm for Washington, D.C.
According to the report, 19.1 million people visited the District in 2021, which is 77.6% of the visitors the District saw in 2019. Domestic travelers made up an overwhelming majority of visitors at 98.4% of total visitors.
The number of overseas visitors jumped by 21% from 2020, which DDC said is likely due to the loosening of travel restrictions, mask mandates and COVID-19 testing regulations, according to DDC.
The District is primarily focused on drawing more international travelers, who typically stay in the city longer and spend more money than domestic visitors, according to DDC. 
“DDC has concentrated on increasing overseas visitation to Washington, DC, especially in top European markets where recovery potential is likely faster,” DDC wrote to The Hoya. “Growing overseas market share through strategic sales and media missions could lead to a greater economic impact for Washington, DC.”
Tourists play a crucial role in the District’s economy, according to DDC. In 2021, D.C. visitors spent $5.4 billion during their trips, a 45% increase in spending since 2020. Visitors also supported 57,933 local jobs in the District’s tourism industry in 2021, a 41% increase since 2020. 
DDC is working to increase business and leisure travel recovery, starting with stronger advertising tactics to draw tourists to the District, according to DDC President and CEO Elliott Ferguson.
“DC’s tourism economy is moving forward, so now our role as a short-term economic development organization is to be aggressive with high-impact advertising, attract more conventions and meetings and win back overseas travelers because of their higher spending potential,” Ferguson wrote in a DDC press release Aug. 30. 
D.C. will also host the MLS’s All-Star Game in 2023, an event that will likely attract more visitors to the district. 
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) said these events will draw attention to the lively culture of the District and attract both domestic and foreign visitors.
“We are very happy to have visitors from across the nation and around the world back in DC,” Bowser said in the DDC press release. “We are going to keep spreading the word that DC is open, and we will keep giving people new ways to enjoy our city — from conferences and concerts, to festivals and 5Ks, and all the other events that bring people together and uplift the values and culture of our community.”
According to DDC, certain obstacles still remain before international tourism in D.C. can fully return to pre-pandemic levels — quarantine requirements in home countries and the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies both affect the numbers of overseas visitors that can be received. 
“What Washington, DC is facing is unfortunately not just specific to DC but the US and major cities as a whole,” DDC wrote. “Health restrictions are also still in place in many countries across the world due to the pandemic. China was Washington, DC’s number one overseas market in 2019 and still requires a quarantine upon return.”
Many in the tourism industry, including President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association Geoff Freeman, believe tourism in D.C. will recover to its pre-pandemic levels, even if that recovery is slow.
“Travel’s future is promising and bright,” Freeman said in the DDC press release. “With a concerted effort to address today’s headwinds — including slow-to-return business travel and government-induced obstacles for international visitors — we’re confident that Washington, DC and the nation can achieve a full recovery.”
DDC said the D.C. tourism industry remains hard at work, but total overseas tourism to the U.S. will likely not reach 2019 levels until 2025, according to Tourism Economics and MMGY Travel Intelligence. 
Community members can aid in the recovery by welcoming tourists to the District, according to DDC.
“Washingtonians are used to many cultures and languages and are incredibly welcoming,” DDC wrote. “Just like domestic tourists, we appreciate positive interactions with our international community, from simply giving directions or saying hello to teaching them about DC’s storied history, hidden gems and how to find them.”

As a GU alumnus (SFS) and GU adjunct faculty member (destination planning and development) whose business is focused on international sustainable tourism development, I was pleased to see The Hoya cover tourism recovery in Washington, DC. As we saw during the pandemic, when the tourism industry stops, much of the economy also grinds to a halt.  Tourism has direct, indirect, and induced effects on economies, especially in terms of employment and income generation. Thanks for covering this important subject.

The McCourt School of Public Policy hosted a seminar to discuss an Oxford University professor’s book on modern international development theory.
The Sept. 19 seminar featured Director of the Oxford Centre for the Study of African Economies Stefan Dercon’s book entitled “Gambling on Development: Why Some Countries Win and Others Lose.”
This latest work from Dercon, which was published Aug. 1 by Hurst Publishers, an independent non-fiction publisher, explores contemporary factors that contribute to the varying levels of prosperity attained by developing countries. The study is approached from a number of angles, primarily using case studies from African nations including Sierra Leone, Mozambique, South Sudan and Malawi.
Dercon said witnessing the wide disparities that have grown between nations, and in particular those in Africa in the past 30 years, inspired his interest in international development.
“There are places in the last few decades that have transformed, and others haven’t,” Dercon told The Hoya. “Just trying to think about ‘What does it matter why some of these countries are successful or not?’ was just a very compelling reason for me.”
The book features conversations Dercon has had over his three decades of travel through 40 different countries researching global economies.
Specifically, Dercon’s fieldwork in China demonstrates the phenomena that is the focus of his book — where elites within an economy must risk prioritizing broad economic growth and development over other economical concerns on a gamble that doing so will lead to greater long-term benefits.
“The change in China came because the regime suddenly got really committed in the mid-1970’s and early 80’s to growth and development, not ideology,” Dercon said.
Andrew Zeitlin, an assistant professor at the McCourt School and research assistant at the Center, said the key takeaway from the book is that those with political power must take risks to prioritize long-term success in their countries.
“The emergence of a bargain in which the elites of an economy agree that although there are other ways to make your life nice, the way that they want to pursue is a route that operates through the growth of an economy as a whole,” Zeitlin told The Hoya. “That central thesis locates his answer to why some economies grow faster than others in a political bargain, rather than a set of economic policy prescriptions.”
James Habyarimana, professor at the McCourt School and former co-director of Georgetown’s Initiative on Innovation, Development and Evaluation, an initiative working to incubate and evaluate effective development solutions, said this choice is not an easy one to make.
“Where development is going to be much, much harder, the gamble is even less attractive,” Habyarimana said in an interview with The Hoya. “And so the choices these politicians have is, do you want to solve a really, really hard problem, with a high chance of failing, or do you, essentially, want to play the game as usual?”
Habyarimana said this decision relates to his work in international development on a more local scale.
“I work at the level of schools and health facilities, so in some ways this bigger-picture idea of producing economic growth is not immediately salient in my work,” Habyarimana said. “I am very familiar with the choices and decisions made by different governments, where in my work, in some ways, makes me think about a very similar kind of bargain happening at the level of education or health.”
According to Dercon, existing literature on international development can often patronize the people living in the countries being studied, which was something he actively tried to avoid.
“What I was really pleased with is the reaction I’ve had in the countries about which I wrote, from Nigeria, from Bangladesh,” Dercon said. “I don’t feel like people feel patronized.”
Dercon also said the book is not just for academics, but anyone curious about the field of international development.
“If you work as a practitioner or are an interested party, could you read it? That was definitely my goal,” Dercon said. “This is not a popular book, but it’s a book that is aimed at those people who are interested in it and want to learn more.”

The Georgetown Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues hosted a discussion on China’s economic strategy and its implications for domestic politics. 
David Steinberg, an associate professor of International Political Economy at Johns Hopkins University, spoke on his research about how China’s rising global economic influence impacts support for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the country at the Oct. 21 event. Steinberg’s presentation focused on his team’s three-year-long experiment that surveyed the Chinese public in 2019, 2021 and 2022 to gauge the popularity of China’s major economic projects. 
Though many studies have been conducted on China’s growing economy, Steinberg said a lack of existing literature on the political consequences of this development inspired his research. 
“There has been extensive debate about how China’s rise in general, and its growing economic influence in particular, is reshaping world politics and economics,” Steinberg wrote to The Hoya. “We suspected that these developments also have important political impacts within China itself, and we wanted to see if that was the case.” 
Steinberg said nations hoping to accumulate greater political power often use economic success to gain legitimacy on the international stage. 
“Rising powers have generally sought to expand their role in global economic governance, and of course, China is no exception to this,” Steinberg said at the event. “China has gone historically from being a recipient of foreign aid to a provider of foreign aid.” 
The Belt and Road Initiative, a multibillion dollar investment by Chinese President Xi Jinping to connect Asia, Africa and Europe by land and sea routes, is one example of China’s attempt to secure economic dominance, according to Steinberg. 
Steinberg also surveyed the Chinese population on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a Beijing-based lending program that finances Asian infrastructure projects, and China’s foreign vaccine distribution efforts during the pandemic. 
These displays of economic strength commonly correlate with increased trust in the government, according to Steinberg.
“There’s evidence suggesting that when the population is more optimistic about the economy, both in democracies and authoritarian regimes, this tends to boost support for the incumbent,” Steinberg said. 
For his experiment, Steinberg created three separate versions of a survey assessing popular support of the CCP that depicted China’s economic expansion projects as either successful, unsuccessful or neutral. 
Participants who received a survey mentioning the failures of these initiatives tended to rate their support for China’s global economic expansion 0.7 points lower than control respondents on a 10-point scale.
Steinberg said this change may seem negligible, but it actually holds significance considering that Chinese citizens have largely only been exposed to state-controlled media that paints the government and its investments in a positive light. 
“They’re consuming national media, which, yes, there are some more critical portrayals of these programs in the Chinese media, but I bet you have 99 positive articles for every negative one,” Steinberg said. “There’s sort of an existing sense that these have been overwhelmingly successful programs.”
Steinberg said one explanation for his findings is that a strong economy fosters citizens’ pride in their national identity and thus bolsters public support for the government. 
“People might think about a country’s global economic influence as telling you something about the status of the nation in world politics,” Steinberg said. “The people that identify with the Chinese nation as a relevant identity group see that the nation-state is playing a larger role and would view that as a sort of positive for status or self esteem.” 
Steinberg said he is confident China’s ability to manipulate public support using economic strategy will influence their political choices moving forward. 
“It sure seems like this will matter,” Steinberg wrote. “The initial signs seem to suggest that Chinese foreign policy will take on an even more assertive stance than beforehand.”

International relations and diplomacy experts discussed the past, present and future of relations between Russia, Ukraine and the United States at a virtual panel co-hosted by Georgetown’s Free Speech Project (FSP) and Future of the Humanities Project. 
The Nov. 14 event, entitled “Living with Putin: Russia and the West,” featured Corneliu Bjola, the head of the Oxford Digital Diplomacy Research Group; Susan Eisenhower, chair emeritus at the Eisenhower Institute; Ellen Ioanes, a foreign affairs reporter for Vox; and Katherine Lawlor, senior intelligence analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, a military affairs research group. The webinar was the 25th event in a monthly series hosted by the FSP and Future of Humanities Project called “Free Speech at the Crossroads: International Dialogues.”
John McCabe, program manager at the FSP, said while the FSP initiative focuses on First Amendment conditions in the United States, it is interconnected with international discourse.
 “The idea is that free speech as an issue has an international angle to it, where often First Amendment or free speech problems that we think are unique to the United States are actually a larger problem internationally,” McCabe told The Hoya.
Speakers at the event discussed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s motivations behind the military invasion of Ukraine that began Feb. 24, including his global and domestic perceptions. 
Putin cares about how he is perceived both in Russia and abroad, Ioanes said. 
“His reputation within Russia and to the Russian people, and how he comes off to them — that’s a really important thing to him as well, maybe equally as important or even more important than how he appears on the international stage,” Ioanes said at the event. “He depends on the Russian people to keep him in power.”
Speakers also discussed what post-war peace may look like in Russia. Bjola said that in order for peace to last, it can’t rest on easily reversible policies like ceasefires. 
“The question is what kind of peace — a fragile peace or an enduring peace,” Bjola said. “A fragile peace is one that you may conclude tomorrow with a ceasefire that can resume in the spring.”
Lawlor said fragile peace that freezes the war along its current front lines could further undermine Ukrainian sovereignty and harm Ukraine in the long term. 
“Peace sounds great, but who does that peace serve?” Lawlor said. “Ukraine also has to be empowered to make that decision, if we really believe in sovereignty. Ukraine’s sovereignty is the point of this war, and therefore it is not the role of the United States or of China or Russia to make decisions on at what point Ukraine draws the line for its own sovereignty.”
Eisenhower and other speakers also discussed the role of the United States in the international community, saying past examples of U.S. intervention, notably in Afghanistan, demonstrate an ineffective approach to foreign conflict.
“My heart hurts when I think about the way the United States of America left Afghanistan,” Eisenhower said at the event. “The United States of America needs to really sit down and have a hard think about some of the things we’ve done. We have to be in the business of trying to win friends and influence people in a positive way.”
In its handling of relations with Afghanistan and Iraq, which led to the U.S. starting wars in both states, Eisenhower said the U.S. has potentially created material for Putin’s propaganda campaigns.
Ioanes also said Putin often takes what the U.S. media reports on and uses it as propaganda to advance the ideas he wants to convey to the Russian public, though acknowledging this has not prevented her from executing her journalistic responsibilities.
“We know that things we say and things that we write are going to be used as propaganda tools,” Ioanes said. “Does that stop me from saying what is true? Does that keep me from talking to people and making sure that my audience is informed about what’s going on and what I personally am reading and hearing about? If we thought about that all the time, we would be completely paralyzed.”
McCabe said the aim of the webinar series is to promote as much free speech as possible.
“Our model is that more speech is always the best protocol,” McCabe said. “So, however we can get those conversations and important dialogues out there to the rest of the world and make people think in a more critical way about free speech and the First Amendment and how those issues stretch internationally, the better.”
Michael Scott, an event moderator and the director of the Future of the Humanities Project, an interdisciplinary initiative that addresses the humanities and public life, said attendees should consider the importance of recognizing the human consequences of the war in Ukraine.
“We shouldn’t forget that in a war, there are casualties, even as we are speaking, on both sides,” Scott said at the event. “I think in politics, we sometimes forget that.”
Looking ahead, Bjola said Russia’s downfall could come quickly and unexpectedly.
“For someone who grew up in an authoritarian country, what I can say is that from our side, authoritarian regimes look strong and impenetrable — until they’re not,” Bjola said. “They can collapse overnight. That’s the thing about authoritarian states.”

Georgetown University students held a vigil to honor the lives lost in an apartment fire that led to the deaths of 10 people in Xinjiang, an autonomous territory in northwest China that is home to the ethnic minority of the Uyghur people. Many have blamed the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) restrictive COVID-19 lockdown policies for the deaths.
Over 50 community members gathered in Red Square on Nov. 30 to commemorate the lost lives by lighting candles and holding up protest banners with slogans like “Stop Lockdown, Free China” and “We Demand Freedom Now.” Since the tragedy, which killed 10 and injured nine, a wave of protests has occurred around the world and, more notably, inside China itself, a rarity in the state considering potential government retaliation.
Protesters believe Chinese President Xi Jinping’s “zero-COVID” policy, which mandates routine lockdowns and community-wide testing, obstructed timely evacuations and prevented rescue teams from accessing the building. The incident sparked further controversy because Uyghur families comprised the majority of victims.
Beijing has arbitrarily detained over one million Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims since 2016, according to the Human Rights Watch. Detained individuals report experiences of torture, sexual abuse, cultural persecution and high level surveillance in the CCP’s reeducation camps, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. 
Protester Howard Xuan (SFS ’23) said the Chinese government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates existing oppression of minority groups.
“The zero-tolerance COVID policy has been an abominable policy. And that combined with the persecution that’s going on in Xinjiang makes it practically doubly as condemnable in front of the CCP,” Xuan told The Hoya.
Yen-Han Chen (COL ’25), a Taiwanese national, said he appreciated the opportunity to practice freedom of speech at the Red Square protest. 
Chen said he participated in the vigil to pay his respects to the victims and express his discontent with the CCP.
“Whether you’re Taiwanese, Hong Kong or anything else, Chinese state violence has always faced someone,” Chen told The Hoya. “And I’m so glad that right now there’s more people who see this as a serious issue, the harm that it causes.”
Chen said a familial history with CCP corruption sparked his interest in the issue.
“For me, the reason is a little more personal. I never got to meet my grandfather. He was a nuclear scientist, and he contracted cancer, likely from his line of work, and there was very little transparency. So I guess, in a way, there’s always this sort of resentment with a state that devalues human rights and human life,” Chen said. 
Several demonstrators also spoke about the importance of public expression and told their own personal stories. One Uyghur graduate student, who asked not to be named in order to protect their identity, said their family witnessed the chaos that erupted in Xinjiang the night of the fire. 
David Song (COL ’26) said the global social media attention on the state’s abuse against Uyghurs prompted him to attend the protest.
“I’ve been following all the protests and the situation on social media,” Song told The Hoya. “I follow a couple of accounts that have posted protest visuals from various cities across the world.”
As dissidents of the CCP often face serious penal consequences, many attendees at the Georgetown vigil wore masks to conceal their identities. 
One international student from China who attended the demonstration, but declined to be named, said they are optimistic about the future of global intervention in China.
“I’m so glad there’s so many people out here to commemorate this tragedy,” the student told The Hoya. “There is racism and discrimination everywhere in the world. But as long as you have progress, as long as people care, that’s the first step to resolving it.”
Xuan said that even if the vigil cannot enact sweeping change, there is value in the shared experience of mourning and protesting together.
“The pessimist in me says that a couple of college students protesting on a U.S. campus somewhere, even if there’s some Chinese people there, might not have much effect,” Xuan said. “But I think maybe just drawing more eyes and ears to what’s going on in China is a benefit in and of itself.”

Former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) and former presidents of Uruguay, Mexico and Colombia spoke about the state of affairs in Latin America at Georgetown University’s first “Americas Symposium.”
The Nov. 30 event that took place in Gaston Hall was an initiative by the Georgetown Americas Institute (GAI), an organization dedicated to researching and discussing the challenges impacting Latin America. Former president of Uruguay Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera, former president of Mexico Ernesto Zedillo and former president of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos, who joined the conversation virtually, tackled discussions on poverty, inequality and organized crime in Latin America in a conversation moderated by Diana Kapiszewski, an associate professor of government at Georgetown University. Clinton, who intended to attend in-person, delivered a speech on U.S. ties with Latin America remotely, after testing positive for COVID-19 just hours before the event.
Clinton said it is vital for students at Georgetown to learn about the conflicts taking place in Latin America so that they are equipped to tackle them.
“They need to know that it’s not just a phrase to say we need to be involved with the rest of the world, that getting a Georgetown education which teaches you about other countries and cultures, particularly in the Americas, is not just something that should help your career,” Clinton said. “It has to build a state of mind among our people that what we have in common is more important than our interesting differences.” 
He said the United States cannot walk away from Latin American countries like Colombia and Venezuela at a time when they are facing a reemergence of narcotics trafficking and gang violence. 
“We need to be there with them side by side,” Clinton said at the event. “All of us.”
Alejandro Werner, the founding director of GAI, said the goal of the event was to mark the institute’s inaugural year and to foster dialogue about the living standards in Latin America. 
“With this event, we celebrate our inaugural year and we gather to reflect the social and economic challenges that Latin America faces, as well as the need to strengthen and redesign its regional ties and its relationship with the U.S. and Canada,” Werner said at the event. 
University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) announced the GAI’s establishment in August 2020. Werner was appointed as the institute’s first director in October 2021. 
In the 2020 announcement, DeGioia said the institute would focus on four spheres: governance and the rule of law, economic innovation, social and cultural inclusion and sustainability and the environment. He said he looks forward to the contributions the institute will make to the Georgetown community.
“I would like to thank our institute staff, the institute’s faculty committee, its advisers for their work to guide this new endeavor,” DeGioia said at the event. “We look forward to the contributions of this new institute and the collaborations and partnerships it will foster.” 
Zedillo, who served as Mexico’s president from 1994 to 2000, said that many Latin American countries are facing a regression of democracy. 
“Once they are in power, the first thing that they like to do is to start undermining democracy within the institutions that allowed them in the first place to compete and to win power,” Zedillo said. 
Following the event, students condemned the inclusion of Zedillo at the event. Zedillo was charged with the 1997 killing of 45 Tzotzil indigenous people. In January 2012, he claimed that his status as a former president granted him immunity for his crimes. 
Lacalle, who served as president of Uruguay from 1990 to 1995, said that Latin America is placed in a difficult position as its ideals and economics are tied to several different foreign alliances. 
“If we take the side of the values, of course we are with the United States, with the European Union and with the Christian civilization,” Lacalle said at the event. “On the other side, the reality of trade and prosperity comes from the relationship with China.” 
Santos, who served as Colombia’s president from 2010 to 2018, said the biggest problem Latin American countries are facing is the war on drugs. 
Drug traffickers and organized crime have permeated Colombia, according to Santos.
“Colombia lost our best journalists, our best judges or best political leaders and our best policemen in this war, and I personally had the responsibility of fighting this war when I was minister of defense,” Santos said at the event.

An adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Security Studies and military expert discussed the past, present and future of Chinese naval power at a Jan. 24 event.
At the event, Toshi Yoshihara (SFS ’95), the former John A. van Beuren Chair of Asia-Pacific studies at the U.S. Naval War College, spoke about his latest book, “Mao’s Army Goes to Sea: The Island Campaigns and the Founding of China’s Navy.” The conversation was centered around the importance of studying Chinese naval history in the current geopolitical landscape. 
Yoshihara said he decided to write his book on Maoist-era naval history because the subject has not received enough coverage in the West.
“They did some pretty amazing things during the period we don’t give them credit for,” Yoshihara said at the event. “The People’s Liberation Army enjoys a very proud history. If we have a better understanding of the PLA’s history, we can understand them better now.”
Yoshihara said Chairman Mao’s original motivation for founding a communist navy force goes back to the tail end of the Chinese Civil War, when the PLA was poised to cross the Yangtze River and take South China but found themselves hindered by insufficient naval power.
“The communists, as they were crossing the Yangtze River, they realized they were trading land warfare for a new set of challenges, confronting the nationalists at sea,” Yoshihara said. “The communists had no sea power to speak of, whereas the nationalists had the support of the U.S.”
Mao knew a strong navy would be critical to future military successes, according to Yoshihara. 
He said Mao commissioned General Zhang Aiping, even though he had no previous naval experience — a choice Mao made hoping Aiping could transfer his military expertise as one of the PLA’s top officers to help China build its sea power.
“I want you to teleport yourself into April of 1949,” Yoshihara said. “I want you to imagine that you’re an upcoming rising star in the PLA in your late 30s and early 40s. Imagine you’ve been injured, and you’ve just returned to duty, and you’re eager to prove yourself. The commander wants you to start a new navy, you have no money, no staff, no structure, you are a one-man show. That is the story of Commander of the East China Navy Zhang Aiping.”
Yoshishara said his primary focus when he started writing his book was on how China built a world-class navy with little to no previous experience.
“The key question I asked was, how does an agrarian, land-bound army go to sea?” Yoshihara said.
The Chinese government had to bring communists and nationalists together to advance China’s knowledge on building sea power, according to Yoshihara.
Yoshihara said that after integrating nationalists into their personnel, Mao and Zhang were able to construct the foundation for a Chinese naval dominance that continues today.
“It also gave China a commanding position over the South China Sea, a position that remains today,” Yoshihara said. “Having Hainan passed on a significant amount of strategic and military leverage to China.”
Yoshihara said everyone should learn about this understudied aspect of Chinese history.
“Instead of overlooking or downplaying the history, it is worth noting there is history that the PLA is very proud of,” Yoshihara said. “How the PLA retails this history tells us a lot about the PLA. If we neglect this history, we’re neglecting a great opportunity to understand the PLA and their motivations today.”

CW: This article discusses gun violence and racial violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The Georgetown University Asian American Student Association (AASA) organized a candlelight vigil to honor the victims of two recent shootings in Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay, Calif.
Dozens of members of the Georgetown community attended the Jan. 29 event in Red Square, which AASA co-Presidents Ed Shen (MSB ’23) and Maggie Lin (CAS ’23) organized in an effort to create a safe space for Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students to mourn those killed in the back-to-back mass shootings. 
The Jan. 21 Monterey Park shooter killed 11 and injured nine, and the Jan. 23 Half Moon Bay shooter killed seven and left one injured. The majority of the victims were Asian American, and both shootings occurred in majority Asian American communities; Monterey Park has long been considered America’s first suburban Chinatown, and Half Moon Bay is located just miles away from Silicon Valley, where Asian Americans make up the largest ethnic group. 
Shen said it was important to organize the vigil because it allowed members of the Georgetown community to mourn together.
“During tumultuous times, it is important to take care of each other and feel that we are not alone,” Shen wrote to The Hoya. “We figured that a vigil would be an opportunity to stand in solidarity with other AAPI students, reflect upon these tragedies and consider their larger implications for gun control in the United States and violence within communities of color.”
The shootings coincided with the first weekend of Lunar New Year, a time when Asian Americans often throw elaborate celebrations and travel long distances to be with their families. 
Shen said the timing of the shootings, along with the growing frequency of anti-Asian violence, made them especially painful.
“During the vigil, members of our community shared how difficult it was to process these tragedies during a period of time that was intended for celebration,” Shen wrote. “We discussed the rising rates of violence within our community and how it often feels like there is nothing we can do in the face of tragedy.”
Hate crimes against Asian Americans increased 339% nationwide in 2021, especially in large cities including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Many Asian American community leaders linked the rise in violence against the AAPI community to anti-Asian racism during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Aria Nimmagadda (CAS ’26) attended the vigil and said events like it help reinforce a sense of community among students.
“What happened in California is incredibly tragic and horrible,” Nimmagadda wrote to The Hoya. “I thought the vigil was a really strong show of support within the Georgetown community and hearing people share their grieving processes was very inspiring and helpful in knowing that no one needs to go through this difficult time alone.” 
At the vigil, Max Zhang (SFS ’23, MSB ’23) spoke about how sharing his initial reactions with those around him allowed him to better process the shootings.
Zhang said events like the vigil are a necessary outlet for students to share their collective experiences of trauma and loss.
“Forums for communal mourning are critical when we face community grief, and I was grateful I got to be there,” Zhang wrote to The Hoya. “It’s important to pursue connection and show solidarity in this time where so many communities on-campus feel affected by violence.”
Georgetown stands in solidarity with members of the AAPI community and condemns the acts of violence, according to an email sent to community members Jan. 23. 
“We recognize that in recent years, we have seen growing violence and hatred against our Asian American community in the United States,” the university wrote in the Jan. 23 email. “This is deeply concerning to all of us.”
In the wake of the shootings, Zhang said Georgetown must better support its AAPI student community.
“Translate ‘solidarity’ into material change. Establish the Asian-American studies program we deserve and need to study violence within and towards our communities,” Zhang wrote. 
“Create mental health services catered to serve Asian students better. And bolster programs for marginalized students in general — the popular narratives forget sometimes how much supporting Asian people also means supporting first-generation and low-income students, undocumented students, queer students, international students, and more,” Zhang wrote.

Citigroup Global Chief Economist Nathan Sheets delivered his largely pessimistic 2023 global economic forecast on Feb. 6 to Georgetown University students in the Intercultural Center (ICC).
The Georgetown Americas Institute, a research center focusing on key challenges facing Latin America, and the Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, a research center about good financial industry practices and policies, co-hosted the event. Sheets discussed domestic monetary and fiscal policy, U.S.-China trade relations and global market projections during his talk, suggesting overall pessimism for the global economy in 2023.
Sheets projects low economic confidence due to high inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes, saying governments have a lot of work to do to restore consumer confidence in banks.
“Central banks look at the high level of inflation as an existential challenge,” Sheets said at the event. “As they’ve seen the inflation surge, it’s kind of a four alarm fire within the central banking community. And they’re hiking vigorously to try to bring it down.”
Sheets said a key global economic development has been the shift in consumer spending away from goods and toward services, with the United States as a prime example of this transition.
“The strength of services has important implications for the growth outlook, for real GDP, for inflation and for labor markets,” Sheets said. “Of all of the 517,000 total job creations during the month of January, 128,000 was in leisure and hospitality alone, and educational and health services were another 105,000.”
Services markets produce more than two-thirds of the global gross domestic product (GDP). They have become increasingly dominant in the global economy and provide close to two-thirds of jobs in developing countries and four-fifths of jobs in developed countries.
Oversaturated services markets have created large inflationary pressures, which Sheets said the global economy needs to address moving forward.
“Taking some momentum out of the services sector can be a tougher kind of proposition, which kind of boils down to convincing all of us to stop spending so much on services,” Sheets said. “We think that getting inflation down to two percent ultimately is going to be a slog.”
Despite his overall pessimism for the global market, Sheets said it is helpful that different regions of the world operate on different economic timelines because market volatility will be better distributed.
“We see a lot of recession risk in the global economy this year. But an important point is that it doesn’t look like all of the major economies are going to go down together,” Sheets said. “There’s a story in the United States, there’s a story in the Euro area, there’s a story in China, there’s a story in the emerging markets and they’re all pretty different.”
With an increasingly powerful economy, Sheets said China will be a potential major player on the global stage for years to come. 
“China’s economy is growing, it’s becoming more powerful,” Sheets said. “A bigger part of the global economy, China itself is more influential.”
Latin America’s strong performance over the past few years is another reason for optimism about the future of the region, according to Sheets.
“Latin American economies were much more resilient than what we were expecting,” Sheets said. “And specifically for Brazil, we were expecting Brazil to have a recession in 2022. That never arrived.”
Sheets said recent data collection suggests governments outside of Latin America have also responded well to current economic challenges.
“Most of the information that we’ve received over the last six week period has been more favorable. And specifically, it’s been better than we thought in the Euro area,” Sheets. “It’s been better in China and the data in the United States have been surprisingly resilient.”
Sheets said he has measured optimism for the 2023 fiscal year in light of the flexibility that global financial institutions have demonstrated in a time of economic uncertainty.
“Significant tightening from the Federal Reserve has performed better than we would have expected,” Sheets said. “And I think that the key question, even if there are recessions, we don’t think they’re going to be extremely deep.”
Sheets tempered his hope about the global market due to difficulties other regions of the world face, including the Russia-Ukraine war continuing to complicate supply chains and trade logistics.
“I’m probably the most pessimistic about Central and Eastern Europe,” Sheet said. “That region right now, for obvious geopolitical reasons, is disrupted.” 
Sheets said other geopolitical tensions could also create more economic fragmentation in the long run, especially between the U.S. and China.
“I do see kind of a deeper divide and deeper schism emerging on the tech front between the United States and China. And potentially, if the United States brings in other allies, I think we may move to a world where technology operates in two spheres,” Sheets said. “I don’t know what that means for the global economy. It’s got to be negative.”

Former Mexican Undersecretary for Foreign Trade Luz María de la Mora discussed the future of Latin American trade with Georgetown University students on Feb. 6.
The Latin American Policy Association (LAPA), a student group dedicated to the discussion of Latin American policies and politics, and the Georgetown University Graduate Association of Mexican Students (GUGAMS), a student group focused on professional development and Mexican cultural appreciation, organized the event. 
De la Mora focused the discussion on restructuring supply chains, which she sees as a top economic priority for Latin American countries, particularly Mexico, in combination with maintaining macroeconomic stability and a strong fiscal policy.
De la Mora said it is important for Latin America to scale up its supply chains in order for the region to play a bigger role in political development.
“Geopolitics are taking a very important place in global issues, and Latin America has a role to play,” de la Mora said at the event. “We are not very clear about where we are located and what are the benefits of integrating or participating in the global economy, so we are suffering from the effects of the global decisions.”
Latin American countries have experienced a slowdown of trade integration efforts because of geopolitical circumstances like the pandemic, according to de la Mora.
“We have talked about the US-China trade relations, we have  talked about the Russia-Ukraine invasion, we have talked about things that are happening in the European Union, how this is affecting global supply chains,” de la Mora said. “We know that there are very important challenges now. For example, we have suffered tremendously from inflation as a result of the Russia-Ukraine invasion, but also because of the pandemic.”
De la Mora said the existing state of affairs in Latin America is dismal because Latin America has not been a traditional hotspot for international trade.
“Latin America is a minor player in international trade,” de la Mora said. 
Latin America makes up about three percent of exports and three percent of imports of global trade, according to de la Mora. Trade in Latin American countries like Brazil and Argentina  amounts to less than 30% of their GDP. 
De la Mora said that Latin American countries could take advantage of nearshoring, which are outsourcing efforts by geographically proximate countries and free trade agreements to stimulate trade in the region.
“The opportunity here is, how can we find those specific inputs or products or sectors?” de la Mora said. “In labor intensive industries, for example, textile and fashion, that is  an area in which we see a lot of movement.”
Countries like Mexico already have multiple trade agreements in place, but could stand to gain from building new relationships with countries they have not previously interacted with, according to de la Mora.
“After the European Union, the UK and the U.S., Mexico does not have agreements with the Republic of Korea or China, as other countries do have,” de la Mora said. “So that tells you and gives you an idea of where we could integrate into those supply chains.”
De la Mora said Latin America has a high ceiling for growth, especially if political leaders make strategic decisions both in the short and long term.
“I think that Latin America needs to think about industrial policy,” de la Mora said. “And when we talk about industrial policy, I think that we need to choose sectors, we need to choose the champions because we cannot use all of our resources for everything.”
De la Mora said it is important for Latin American countries to direct much more investment into their economic futures so they can compete with the rest of the world.“We need to invest in physical infrastructure in workforce development, rule of law and long term vision,” de la Mora said. “Otherwise, I think we will only see opportunity when there is  plenty of room and there is plenty of work.”

The Georgetown University Ukrainian Society (GUUS) hosted a series of events and protests this week to pay homage to the Ukrainian people one year after the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
GUUS hosted the Feb. 24 event in the Intercultural Center, which featured a choir singing a Ukrainian hymn, prayers led by Peter Mansour and an art exhibit and speeches from Ukrainian students. GUUS students also gathered for a movie screening, marched to a vigil outside the Russian Embassy and rallied at the Lincoln Memorial over the course of the weekend.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has confirmed 8,006 civilian deaths during the Russian invasion as of Feb. 26. An additional estimated 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been either wounded or killed. 
Members of the Georgetown student body and the graduates have stood in solidarity with Ukraine throughout the war, such as through educational speaker events and professors raising over $22 million in humanitarian funds. A $5 million donation from two Georgetown graduates in June 2022 established the Gracias Family Sunflower Current Use Scholarship Fund, which enabled four Ukrainian students to attend Georgetown University on full scholarships and supported several others with merit-based aid.
Kyryl Myronenko (SFS ’26), a Gracias Family Scholar and GUUS organizer, said that while many Georgetown professors focus on Ukraine in their classes, it is beneficial for students to also understand the crisis from a humanitarian perspective.
“Especially here at Georgetown, it’s so important that all the young students, all the future leaders, get an education of not only an academic perspective,” Myronenko told The Hoya. “Everything includes Ukraine, but also it’s important that we students, coming from Ukraine, are able to share our perspective and just spend this time together.”
Myronenko said that for Ukrainian students, being away from home during a time of crisis is a challenge. 
The United States recently received intelligence that the Chinese government has considered supplying Russia with lethal assistance, such as drones and ammunition. Although China has not officially committed to this move, Chinese President Xi Jinping is rumored to be visiting Moscow next week to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Sofia Sulek (SFS ’23), a GUUS organizer who has been actively involved with advocacy efforts for Ukraine since the invasion began, hails from Slovakia, a country neighboring Ukraine. 
Sulek said she still wanted to engage with the Ukrainian cause in any way possible, despite the emotionally stressful nature of the Russian invasion. 
“My country, being neighbors with Ukraine, was affected in the fact that we had so many refugees pouring in,” Sulek told The Hoya. “I immediately, on a personal level, felt like I wanted to get involved and had a responsibility to help out. I was just trying to get to know other people that might be Ukrainian or Eastern European, or from any affected area.”
Olha Kovach (SFS ’26), also an organizer with GUUS and a Gracias Family Scholar, said she appreciates the community and university support, including assistance from the School of Foreign Service with the Feb. 24 event. As part of the event, GUUS set up an art exhibit to honor sixteen Ukrainian students who died fighting for their country. 
Kovach said the exhibit and the stories shared by Georgetown students from Ukraine had a powerful impact on those who attended.
“The Ukrainian students shared their experiences and how war impacted them,” Kovach told The Hoya. “I think it was just really nice that people could hear that and understand what is going on from the students’ perspective.”
Kovach said GUUS plans to host a number of events, including a visit from the Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States Oksana Markarova and a fundraising art fair throughout the Spring semester. 
Myronenko said the Ukrainian community at Georgetown encourages the student body to start conversations and engage with GUUS activism efforts as the war in Ukraine enters its 13th month.
“Do anything you can when you have time, when you have an opportunity. Read the news, speak with us,” Myronenko said. “Even though it’s incredibly hard for us to speak about the war, hard to realize that we are here when everyone is in Ukraine, it’s really important, and we are always very open to tell you everything you would like to learn about Ukraine and Ukrainian society events.”

The School of Foreign Service’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy presented Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield with its annual Trainor Award.
Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations (U.N.), received the J. Raymond “Jit” Trainor Award, which recognizes excellence in the field of diplomacy each year. Thomas-Greenfield retired from the U.S. Foreign Service in 2017, joining the Georgetown University community as the Distinguished Resident Fellow in African Studies at the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, a research organization affiliated with the School of Foreign Service that aims to foster discussion and enable developments in the field of international diplomatic relations.
Thomas-Greenfield previously served in various capacities within the federal government, including as the Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, the Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources, the American ambassador to Liberia and a foreign service officer posted in six countries on four different continents.
Thomas-Greenfield, who joins the ranks of presidents, ambassadors and military officers as a Trainor Award recipient, dedicated her acceptance speech to the pursuit of universal human rights and referenced an important anniversary for the issue.
“Seventy-five years ago, Eleanor Roosevelt stood in a room with diplomats from more than fifty other countries. They were preparing to vote on an unprecedented document, a document so sweeping, so powerful and so dramatic that it would impact every single person on earth. At three o’clock in the morning, after two years of intense negotiations, they adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Thomas-Greenfield said at the event.
Since her 2021 confirmation as only the second Black woman to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Thomas-Greenfield has stood up for marginalized groups worldwide, including the Uyghur Muslims in western China and the Tigray people in northern Ethiopia. 
Thomas-Greenfield said the permanent presence of human rights violators like the Russian and Chinese governments should be a subject of concern for the powerful U.N. Security Council.
“Some of the planet’s most powerful countries are arguing that human rights are not universal, that instead they ought to be applied based on the local context,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “It is no coincidence that these same governments are some of the world’s worst abusers of human rights.”
Thomas-Greenfield said specific actions by both countries’ governments fly in the face of human rights guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
“China has committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the Uyghurs, and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Russian forces have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.”
Before taking questions from student audience members, Thomas-Greenfield spoke with Anne Anderson, an Irish diplomat who served as Ireland’s ambassador to the United States and U.N.
Anderson asked Thomas-Greenfield about recent Chinese actions to increase China’s influence in the U.N., and Thomas-Greenfield said that diplomatic chaos during the Trump administration enabled China to gain a foothold and develop its relationship with Russia.
“There were a lot of gaps and a lot of space that we didn’t hold on to,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “China looked into action and started moving into empty spaces and they did start to flex their muscles. I wasn’t prepared, I will admit, for how close a relationship China and Russia have, despite the fact that there are differences.”
Both China and Russia hold permanent seats in the U.N. Security Council, despite their violations of human rights against minority groups — China continues to persecute the Uyghur people in the Xinjiang region while Russian soldiers have perpetuated atrocities against Ukrainians.
Thomas-Greenfield said America’s global influence is still prevalent and impactful when it is used to its fullest potential, even as concerning developments continue to emerge from Russia and China.
“We’re still the largest funder of the U.N. We still are the largest humanitarian donor. But we have to exert that power to give our voice the power,” Thomas-Greenfield said.
Thomas-Greenfield said she encourages Georgetown students to consider careers in public service, and to keep human rights in mind throughout their journeys.
“In each generation, the struggle continues,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “Soon it will be your turn, and standing still is not an option. Instead, as potential public servants, allow me to enlist you in this struggle. When we see abuses and violations, we must push, prod and fight for justice.”

Content creators rallied outside of the U.S. Capitol on March 22 in response to congressional talks of banning TikTok, a popular China-based social media application with over 1 billion users.
Congressman Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) organized a press conference with more than 20 social media content creators, including Naomi Hearts, Aidan Kohn-Murphy, founder of GenZforChange, and V Spehar to protest the possible TikTok ban. The content creators, whose combined digital following comprises over 60 million people, shared at the conference how the app has positively impacted their lives, small businesses and communities. 
Bowman said banning TikTok will not solve the app’s underlying data and privacy issues.
“The rush to ban TikTok sets a dangerous precedent for our country by undermining our freedom of speech and distracts from the real issue: protecting Americans’ data and privacy,” Bowman said in a March 22 press release.
Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) introduced on March 7 the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act, which allows the federal government to regulate technology and applications that countries posing a national security threat produce. These nations, which the legislation dubs “foreign adversaries,” include China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela.
Meg Leta Jones, associate professor in the Communication, Culture & Technology Program at Georgetown University, a Masters of Arts degree focusing on the impact of technology on society, said conversations about the Tiktok ban stem from several concerns such as the app’s addictive nature, security concerns and international competition in the American technology sector.
A 2022 Pew Research Center study reported that 67% of U.S. teens have used TikTok and 16% of all teens say they use it almost constantly. Additionally, more than 150 million Americans, including 5 million U.S. small businesses, are on TikTok, according to the Bowman press release.
Bowman said the government needs to create all-encompassing regulations rather than banning one app and infringing on free speech rights.
“I, along with millions of others, use TikTok as a place to interact with my community in a positive, uplifting way,” the press release reads. “But this is not about defending TikTok as a company. We need strong regulation that applies to every platform in order to protect our data and especially our children. And we also have to protect young people’s right to free expression.”
Jones said there are many ways in which TikTok influences Americans.
“If the Chinese government is (or can become) involved in either the data collection or content delivery side, U.S. policymakers are concerned about everything from blackmail of U.S. officials to subtle anti-American messaging through influencers, hashtags, and imagery,” Jones wrote to The Hoya.
A bill to ban TikTok from government devices passed on Dec. 14, 2022 and remains in effect. Jones said other countries have begun to ban the app, and it is possible the United States will follow.
“Other countries like India have already banned TikTok and users turn to Reels,” Jones wrote. “Because there are only two mobile operating systems (Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS) with their own app stores for getting programs on phones, making an app illegal makes it fairly inaccessible because those two major tech companies will comply with U.S. law.”
Jones also said that a TikTok ban in the United States would go against certain American principles.
“The first is an open market global trade policy principle, which China has already complicated significantly, having long banned American tech companies like Google and Facebook,” Jones wrote. “The second is open access to information and expression. I’m not a First Amendment scholar, and there are surprisingly diverse opinions about whether a TikTok ban would violate the Constitution.”
Jones said that while it seems unlikely, if the ban were to pass, it would be influential in changing American society.
“TikTok’s massive popularity makes a ban seem unimaginable, but it reminds me of when a series of copyright cases swiftly demolished peer-to-peer music sharing in the early 2000s,” Jones wrote. “Apple made iTunes, and we all survived, but it was a pivotal moment in the history of music and technology. Banning TikTok and the regulation of social media across U.S. states may be a pivotal moment too.”

Discussions of Russia and Ukraine have filled political science classrooms across Georgetown University for over a year, but an April 14 conference hoped to shed light on the other problems and opportunities facing Central Asia.
The Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies (CERES), a branch in the School of Foreign Service, organized the one-day conference, entitled “Scenarios of Power in Central Asia.” The event brought together experts for a discussion regarding Central Asia’s role in the war in Ukraine and world affairs. The conference’s first panel, “Pipe Dreams and Energy Scenarios,” discussed the development of limited oil and gas resources, while the second, “Neighbors, Allies and Geopolitical Scenarios,” involved talks regarding trade sanctions, international alliances and other foreign policy issues.
Theresa Sabonis-Helf, a policy expert and professor who chairs the Science, Technology and International Affairs concentration in the School of Foreign Service Master’s degree program, spoke in the first panel.
Sabonis-Helf said she appreciates rising student interest in Central Asia especially given America’s historically low levels of analysis and research into the region.
“I would argue that, except as an appendage to Afghanistan, the level of U.S. interest in the region has never been as high as I think is warranted, but I think there’s a great new generation and it’s very exciting to sort of see that blossoming at Georgetown,” Sabonis-Helf told The Hoya.
Western countries and intergovernmental organizations, including the European Union, have increasingly sought to expand dialogue and diplomatic relations with Central Asian nations as the region grows in influence, in part due to conflicts in Afghanistan and Ukraine. Antony Blinken, the U.S. secretary of state, visited the region in March 2023 for meetings with foreign ministers in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Gavin Helf, a CERES adjunct professor and conference speaker, said he feels Central Asian studies have shifted away from a focus that formerly revolved around the Russian Federation.
“Any program in post-Soviet studies used to be a program about Russia, and, incidentally, the other stuff,” Helf said. “I think we’ve seen an evolution away from everything being Russia-centric and looking through the prism of Russia.”
Many of the Central Asian countries, including five of the seven ending in “stan”, were part of the Soviet Union and accordingly are often impacted by and connected to Russia and its foreign policy. Recently, however, western nations as well as China are vying for influence in the region.
Sabonis-Helf said that after living and working in seven countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union, she has a particular appreciation for perspectives gained from the international diversity at Georgetown. 
“I feel like the presence of students from the broader region in Georgetown’s program is really exciting, because they are folks who want to put their own country in context,” Sabonis-Helf said. “I’ve been really impressed with my students from Central Asia or from the Caucasus or from Ukraine.”
Brianne Todd, a professor of practice at the National Defense University and speaker on the second panel, said she enjoyed the event’s focus on power dynamics, many times understated or ignored, in analyses surrounding Central Asia. 
“As several of the speakers highlighted, Central Asia is facing many challenges currently but there are also incredible opportunities,” Todd wrote to The Hoya. “It was refreshing to discuss Central Asia outside of the usual “great power competition” paradigm and to recognize that there are additional power scenarios (and related implications) to be explored.”
Looking beyond the typical focus on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the panel surveyed energy scenarios in Central Asia, an oil-rich region whose trade deals and partnerships have a ripple effect worldwide. Panelists also discussed geopolitics, including diplomatic allyship in a region increasingly subject to foreign influence as Russian leaders devote time and energy to Ukraine.
The great power competition refers to an ongoing contest between large nations like the United States and Russia to establish hegemony, or monopoly on global influence. As technology and trade relationships have evolved over the course of the twenty-first century, foreign policy practitioners view regions like Central Asia as key players in such power competitions.
Todd said students curious about Central Asia should pursue language and other professional opportunities both in the United States and in the region itself, in addition to exploring classes offered on the Hilltop.
“Beyond Georgetown, there are numerous opportunities to engage in language study, field research, and work experience (both remotely and in person) in and/or on Central Asia,” Todd wrote.
Sabonis-Helf said that Georgetown hosting the conference and its experts shows it is an influential institution for the study of Central Asia.
“The fact that Georgetown could round up that group of people shows that it is one of the programs in Washington that’s really doing great Central Asia, and more broadly post-Soviet, kind of work,” Sabonis-Helf said.

During the final days of last semester, I, like many others, was trapped here on campus by the Snowpocalypse. Tests were finished, papers were handed in and not much else was going on beside snowball fights and viewings of “Love Actually” accompanied by hot chocolate. In order to help pass the time, I picked up extra shifts at Vital Vittles. As few students were left on campus, however, the hours passed slowly there as well.
That is, until I discovered the magazine rack, chock full of old issues of Newsweek, Vanity Fair and Hip-Hop Weekly Magazine. One article in Time has stayed with me. It labeled the past 10 years as the “Decade from Hell.” If you haven’t read the article, you should – even though it was published almost two months ago. It does a fine job recounting and explaining what went wrong during the so-called Lost Decade.
The article stuck with me because I realized that we grew up while al-Qaida was attacking us, we were invading Afghanistan and Iraq, Mother Nature was losing her temper everywhere and economies were crumbling worldwide. Our generation came of age in the “Decade of Broken Dreams” and lived through some of the worst of times. What does that mean for us and our dreams?
As I related in my very first column, I will always remember where I was on Sept. 11, 2001. But many of my memories are just as wrapped up in the other cataclysmic events of these past 10 years: the fear of birthday letters being filled with anthrax, the bomb drills and simulated lockdowns in school after the D.C. sniper attacks, a seventh-grade dance where rumors spread that the army had captured Osama bin Laden – and we the kids actually cried tears of joy. We had grown up hating the man, praying for his death, but we didn’t even know why.
Images of Americans drowning in the floodwaters of New Orleans – the city where I had celebrated my brother’s graduation only three months before – haunted my young mind. Our stately politicians instructed us in dishonesty and corruption while our beloved athletes taught us the arts of cheating and greed. The stories out of Gitmo and Abu Ghraib confused and shamed us, forcing us to question our American ideals, our American identities. As the market melted down and our promised share in the American dream seemingly vanished, we realized we’d been tricked and taken for a ride by our neighbors who worked on Wall Street and Main Street.
This is the environment in which we grew up. These were the people to whom we looked up. Those are the memories I have – but they are not the only ones.
For every moment I saw scenes of gunfire in Iraq on the news, I also spent half an hour marveling at the adventures of Cory and Topanga on “Boy Meets World” or laughing with Kenan and Kel. The economy may have taken a dip in 2001, but I was still pining for a PlayStation 2, racing my heart out on “Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.” My family and I still vacationed in New Orleans the summer of 2006 – just at Camp Hope with Habitat for Humanity, instead of the Radisson in the French Quarter. Two years later, recession or not, I still went to prom.
Of course there was a lot of crying, sighing, hugging and yelling. Of course things were not the same after 9/11 or the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean or the Virginia Tech shootings. Of course life disconcerted and disoriented us, pulling us in many different directions.
But isn’t that what life does? It messes with you, throws you off course so that you can learn something – about the world, yourself, another. While the devastation of the decade may have drubbed humanity, I would not go so far as to call it the decade from hell. Us children of the last 10 years have emerged better because of them. Because we are the witnesses of a sordid history, one that has taught us about the complex challenges we have inherited, we are better prepared to face them head on. The global state of distress and desolation has inspired within us a call to serve, to be passionate stewards and zealous combatants.
The beginnings of this work are evident here on our campus, in which ideas like social justice, environmentalism and interreligious dialogue thrive. Yes, more work needs to be done, and there is a lot of room for progress. We are just at the beginning. The point is that the complacent millennial generation The New York Times columnist David Brooks once described as apathetic and self-absorbed no longer exists. We are changed. In its place, our new generation of global leaders is emerging – one shaped by this “Decade of Broken Dreams” – but one dreaming and ready to fight for a better world.

As part of Martin Luther King Jr. Day festivities, Georgetown students and community members partook in the “Let Freedom Ring” event at the Kennedy Center on Monday.
Georgetown University, in partnership with the Kennedy Center, co-sponsored the event as a commemoration of King. Tickets were distributed through a lottery system and students who received tickets listened to the musical stylings of Grammy Award-winning artist India.Arie and the Let Freedom Ring Celebration Choir.
“It was a momentous and unforgettable experience to perform awe-inspiring music in an awe-inspiring venue,” Mary Grace (COL ’13) said.
“[We were] surrounded by musicians and public figures in celebration of the life of one awe-inspiring man. It was certainly an opportunity I would not have otherwise had.”
As part of the festivities, Dikembe Mutombo (FLL ’91), NBA legend and former Georgetown men’s basketball player, was presented with this year’s John Thompson Jr. Legacy of a Dream Award. The award’s previous recipients include Rosa Parks (posthumously, in 2006) and Colin Powell in 2005.
Attendees were surprised by the appearance of President Obama, who spoke about King and Mutombo.
“It was a cultural [and] enriching experience that made me extremely proud to be a Hoya,” Maggie Larkin (COL ’13) said. “Not only was the choir scattered with Hoyas, but President Obama, [University] President [John J.] DeGioia and John Thompson Jr. were all there to pay tribute to a Georgetown alum [Mutombo], who is really making a difference in the world.”
The event not only celebrated a great American leader, but allowed students to reflect on what it means to be a member of the Georgetown community and seek change in the world.
“Everything about the whole night was amazing,” Suzanne Fonzi (COL ’13) said. “We heard Dikembe Mutombo and the president speak. We represented well – Ryan Wilson (COL ’12) and President DeGioia gave great speeches and our choir members did a great job. I’ve never been so proud to be a Georgetown student.”
Obama concluded the evening by offering a final reflection on the late King.
“Let us remember the courage of the man who had that dream. Let us remember the perseverance of all those who have worked to fulfill that dream. Let us recommit ourselves to doing our part, in our own lives and as a nation, to make that dream real in the 21st century,” Obama said.
“Seeing Obama that close was an awesome experience,” Larkin said. “I came to Georgetown for experiences like this.”

While no members of the university community have been reported lost or injured as a result of the 7.0 earthquake that struck Haiti on Jan. 12, the university community has mobilized to raise funds for the recovery effort.
 
The natural disaster, which is estimated to have killed over 100,000 people, strikes home for several Georgetown students, faculty and staff members who have lost family and friends.
 
 
 
Valarie Craan (COL ’11), who was born and raised in Port-au-Prince until her move to Florida at age 16, has a personal stake in the catastrophe. While she knows that her family and friends are safe, the devastation of her home country is widespread. She briefly spoke to her cousin Cedric over a spotty Internet connection and was relieved to hear he was safe, although he was running out of food and water.
 
 
 
Craan is coping with the immensity of the destruction in her homeland.
 
 
 
“Whenever I didn’t feel at home [in the United States] I always thought `Oh, I have Haiti, which is so stress-free and happy. I can go back.’ Now I can’t. My fear is that it will never be the same,” she said.
 
 
 
Following the tragedy, the university community assembled to contribute to relief efforts and support the Haitian presence on campus. An interfaith prayer vigil organized by the Caribbean Culture Circle and Campus Ministry held on Jan. 15 commemorated the victims and called for solidarity in the time of crisis. Marta Rifin (COL ’10), a Haitian student, moved many in the crowd of over 80 people to tears with her rendition of Haiti’s national anthem, which she sang in Creole.
 
 
 
“I thank everyone for being out here in the cold and showing their love. I am Haitian, and this tragedy is more than just a national headline. It’s my nation . I’m so blessed to see you all here. It means a lot,” Rifin said.
 
 
 
At the vigil, University President John J. DeGioia spoke of the need for continued action.
 
 
 
“We offer our deepest sympathies, as none of us can ever comprehend the magnitude of this tragedy . Even as our hearts have reached out, let us give all that we can. Let us in this moment answer the call to be women and men for others.”
 
 
 
Some of the fundraising efforts on campus started at the Jan. 15 vigil. The CCC placed boxes in front of the Healy steps at the vigil, and those boxes of donations combined with the collections taken from the men’s and women’s basketball games this weekend totaled over $1,390.
 
 
 
CCC has several other fundraising projects in the works, including a blood drive for the Red Cross, as well as talk of recruiting Wyclef Jean for Georgetown’s spring concert.
 
 
 
Anthony Peña (SFS ’10), president of CCC, said the efforts of the university community have been outstanding, yet stressed the need for a long-term commitment to relief in Haiti.
 
 
 
“This is a longstanding effort that takes a collective effort to aid in recovery. The [CCC] and Georgetown both need to actively continue this effort for future years. There is much more work to be done,” Peña said.
 
 
 
Immediately after the earthquake, university leaders charged the Center for Social Justice with organizing students in response to the tragedy, similar to when it mobilized in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Suzanne Tarlov, associate director of the Center for Social Justice Research, Teaching and Service at CSJ, put together a donation Web page that has been linked to a bank account. So far, CSJ has received $15,415 in online donations and also has received a $10,000 check. All proceeds will be divided among three charitable organizations: Jesuit Refugee Service, Save the Children and Partners in Health.
 
 
 
Other efforts that the CSJ is organizing include a push to place more donation boxes at various Corp locations and at the Georgetown University Medical Center.
 
 
 
Tarlov stated that a group of students from the Jesuit Universities Humanitarian Action Network at Georgetown is discussing a possible humanitarian relief trip this summer. She also detailed plans for several graduate students to form an educational panel consisting of experts on Haiti who could explain its history and culture, giving the Georgetown community a greater understanding of the earthquake’s impact.
 
 
 
Tarlov emphasized the impressiveness of the Georgetown student body’s response to the earthquake.
 
 
 
“Students should feel proud that they are a part of Georgetown. I’ve been so impressed by the motivation of these students and their desire to help others. It’s truly heartwarming and unique to Georgetown in particular,” Tarlov said.
 
 
 
The GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee passed a bill, proposed by Sen. Nichol Nelson-Goedert (COL ’10), to donate $1,000 to the CSJ fund. The final legislation will be debated at the GUSA senate meeting on Jan. 24.
 
 
 
Other fundraising efforts include Georgetown College Academic Counselor Erin Curtin Force and several Georgetown College students’ tabling efforts outside of the College Dean’s office to raise money for relief efforts. Accumulating over $700 in two days, Force and her fellow fundraisers were thankful for the enthusiastic response.
 
 
 
“We just wanted to do something to help . The students who manned the table were thrilled to witness such kindness,” Force said.
 
 
 
The French department, after pledging $500, is also conducting a fund drive for earthquake relief in Haiti in conjunction with Helen Scarry, Roman Catholic chaplain of Campus Ministry.
 
 
 
“Because Haiti is a francophone country, the French department felt particularly compelled to show solidarity with those affected by the earthquake. Funds collected by the department will benefit the Religious of Jesus and Mary, a Roman Catholic Congregation of Sisters that has ministered in Haiti since 1997,” said Susanna Lee, associate professor in the French department.
In another fundraising event, the Georgetown Unconventional Eaters club is holding an authentic Haitian dinner Friday night to raise awareness and collect donations to support recovery in Haiti.
 
 
 
“We are now taking advantage of our love for food and transforming it into something that matters,” President of GUE Tory Pratt (SFS ’11) said.
 
 
 
Other campus clubs, such as Students Stopping the Trafficking of People and the Georgetown chapter of UNICEF, took immediate action, updating members with detailed e-mails and directing them to news links and donation opportunities. UNICEF has been tabling all week in Red Square, and according to UNICEF’s program director Susan O’Rourke (COL ’12), the Georgetown branch of the organization plans to inform members of the university community on the aftermath of the earthquake as the semester continues.
 
 
 
“UNICEF is committed to providing support to the people, especially the children of Haiti, not only through its immediate response, but also through its continued presence during the rebuilding period,” O’Rourke said.
 
 
 
Georgetown University Alumni & Student Federal Credit Union has established a Haiti Relief Fund, which allows students to transfer money to that account. The Student Commission for Unity is planning a silent art auction to raise funds. Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., executive director of Campus Ministry and his colleagues are preparing a Catholic Mass of Remembrance for the People of Haiti on Feb. 2 in Dahlgren Chapel.
 
 
 
Susan Martin, director of the Office of Environmental Health and Safety, has also organized an academic panel, set to take place Jan. 28 in ICC Auditorium, at which panelists will discuss Haiti’s history, culture and its current state of affairs.
 
 
 
The Scholarships for Education and Economic Development Program, which runs through Georgetown University’s Center for Intercultural Education and Development, has been particularly affected by this earthquake. SEED recruits students from impoverished areas of the Caribbean and South and Central America, including Haiti, and equips them in the United States with technical and leadership skills at various community colleges for two years. After their schooling, the students return to their home countries with the education necessary to facilitate the improvement of their own communities.
 
 
 
The SEED coordinator in Haiti is unhurt, as are his two staff members. One staff member’s house collapsed as she was gardening in the backyard with her children, however.
 
 
 
According to SEED Director Paul Silva, 50 Haitian students currently study in the United States through SEED. Georgetown’s CIED is doing everything it can to assist these students; it has located 42 of the students’ families and continues to contact SEED alumni to check on their status. Silva said SEED hopes to set up several of its graduates in the humanitarian response teams like the NGOs that acted quickly in the earthquake’s aftermath.
 
 
 
Efforts on the Hilltop do not stop with current faculty, students and programs, however. Alonzo Mourning (COL ’92), former Georgetown basketball star, started The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti with fellow NBA star Dwayne Wade. According to ESPN, it has already raised over $800,000 in pledges. Mourning is currently in Haiti surveying the target areas for such a fund.
 
 
 
Another alumnus, Jacques-Philippe Piverger (MSB ’99), launched The Haiti Project through his nonprofit organization, Global Syndicate. The Haiti Project aims to hold major fundraising events in six major U.S. cities and hopes to generate more than $500,000 for the cause.
 
 
 
Businesses in the surrounding Georgetown community are also actively pursuing Haitian relief efforts. Georgetown Cupcake raised $6,000 by donating all of its red velvet cupcake sales to Haiti relief on Jan. 13 and 14. Qdoba will donate 5 percent of its profits to Haiti relief from Jan. 18 to Jan. 24.
 
 
 
Today, several Georgetown area businesses are participating in Jefferson Prep’s fundraiser for Doctors Without Borders. With a $10 cover charge and encouraged donations, participants will receive food and drinks catered by Sweetgreen, Rugby Café, Chipotle, Georgetown Cupcake, and Vita Coco and live music provided by DJ Alex of MecTec.
 
 
 
The Kennedy Center is hosting, in partnership with the Embassy of Haiti, “An Evening for Haiti,” featuring Haitian performers and dancers tonight. The concert also features Georgetown’s “Let Freedom Ring” Celebration Choir and the National Symphony Orchestra. Proceeds of the event are directed to the Haitian relief effort. ”

*As world leaders assembled in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December for the UN Climate Summit, three Georgetown students were also in attendance. One of them was Jessica Robbins (SFS ’12), a Science, Technology and International Affairs major with a concentration in energy and environmental studies. In addition to her course load, Jessie is an intern for Earth Policy Institute, a member of Delta Phi Epsilon and involved in the International Relations Club and its upcoming North American Invitational Model UN Conference, for which she is the director of registration. *
 
**What motivated you to go to the Copenhagen climate conference?**
 
I expected it to be a true turning point in international climate change, and I wanted to be there to study it and examine it and be there as closely as I could. I was ready to participate as a civil society [member], which is just voluntary participation by average citizens. Just to be a part of this was important to me.
 
**Did you travel alone to the conference or was it a group effort? How long did you stay?**
 
I left Dec. 10, 2009 and flew to Copenhagen with three other undergraduates: Julia Shindel [COL ’10], Olivia Chitayat [COL ’10] and Kathryn Padgett [SFS ’11] . We have a project that came out of this conference, and the project is not going to look at what happened at the conference, specifically with the policy, but will look at it holistically. The final product will be a documentary. We have already completed one panel, which was composed of people from Georgetown that went to the conference. Another panel is planned for the spring, most likely in March after the documentary comes out. We are also working on a blog, bluegrayandgreen.blogspot.com. This published everything that we did there from day-to-day events to things that we saw as well as bigger issues. Some of the things we saw were marches and activists, and a lot of pre-emptive arrests were made while we were there. Copenhagen is known to not be too friendly to civil society due to riots in previous years, so it was really intense and at times violent. Kathryn was able to see Al Gore speak, which was a highlight of the trip.
 
**What is significant about the Copenhagen conference?**
 
It’s not significant for its outcome, which was a nonbinding treaty that the [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change] said that [it] would take note of, but wasn’t adopted wholeheartedly as hoped. The accord was not that strong. But it is significant because of the attention that it got. Heads of state got together, which is major. It shows that climate change is important to everyone. President Obama demanded to meet with [the] Chinese delegation when he heard that things were not going as planned, and he took action. This conference gave climate change the attention it truly deserves.
 
**Describe your experience at the conference.**
 
It was an overwhelming, exciting, exhilarating, intense experience. It was easy to feel insignificant there because there were so many people, as well as the scope of the conference. The negotiations were closed to the public, so it was hard to tell what was going on even if you were there. The people who were involved in those negotiations had to feel comfortable talking freely, so that’s why it had to be private.
 
**What was your favorite part of the conference?**
 
It was really incredible. The people that I met, such as students from around the world, Africans who saw this final decision at the conference as life or death, really made the experience memorable. I remember in particular an old Indian guy who wrote poems about climate change. Just those kinds of experiences changed my viewpoint. Coming in as a Georgetown student, I had a narrow perspective, and I didn’t realize how easy I have it. I can return to my home easily, but some people who were there have to go back to their places and worry if it will still be there in the coming century because it might be underwater by then. I came into it as a student, but meeting people who took the conference as something emotional for them, as something that could truly affect their own life, opened my eyes. It was inspiring. Beyond the negotiations, it was nice to be able to just talk to people. It was incredible-the amount of dialogue that occurred- just talking and learning about each other.
 
**What did you do at the conference?**
 
It’s a pretty formal meeting. We watched a working group go over a document and they looked at the text very carefully to make sure that everything was how it should be, focusing on even the minute details such as using words like “shall” or “should” and which is the best to use. Many of the big decisions were made by the bigger nations. Some of the bigger issues were finance, transparency and targets. With finance, the concern was, “Who will pay and how much?” The [European Union] pledged money, and the [United States] hadn’t made a big pledge because they didn’t want to give money to China, since they thought China truly didn’t need it. In the end, everyone wanted to put forth as little as possible and still get the best deals. Finally, the [United States] decided to pledge a lot; [Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton came forward and said she would propose a fund, and although it wasn’t [clear] how much would be contributed, it was still a huge step.
Transparency was with regard to how much control and knowledge people would have about the use of the money being put forth. China didn’t want to let inspectors in or have people poking around their factories, and China is known to give accurate reports. With targets, people wanted to know who would commit and to what. Late Friday night, people began to run out of time for bargaining. The first week and a half I didn’t know what they were doing. We were able to get together, but the big open meetings were empty in substance because it was kind of a repeat of things that were already known.
 
**If you could change one thing about the conference, what would it be?**
 
I wouldn’t change too many things. In a perfect world, it would have been more open to interests of countries it represented, such as those most affected but who had the least political platform. If these were involved, their input would have been great. Usually the bigger countries with more influence such as the [United States] and China were most involved in the negotiations, while all of Africa was shut out. The most tragic result of the conference was that these countries had no say. I think that people [were] too caught up in the little details. As a whole, people were too ambitious, and this led to a weak agreement. We need feasible actions to reverse deforestation and establish better technology benchmarks to increase energy, and these would be beneficial to both the environment and the economy. I think they got hung up on the hard things so they couldn’t formalize an agreement.
 
**Do you think the conference was a success or failure?**
 
Both. It was a failure because it didn’t produce a strong agreement as hoped. However, the dialogue and attention from heads of states all around the world made it a success. The fact that it failed spurs people on to try harder. I think if we did get an agreement, it might have gotten people to feel complacent, as if they were off the hook. More things need to be fixed on a smaller scale, and I think people are starting to realize that. The situation isn’t hopeless, but we’re running out of time.

After an 8.8 magnitude earthquake shook Chile at 3:34 a.m. local time Saturday, Anne Meriwether (COL ’11) was thankful to be in the safety of her bed and eager to let her family know she was out of harm’s way.
Meriwether, one of two Georgetown students studying abroad in the capital city of Santiago, was sleeping at the time of the earthquake and did not immediately realize the extent of the damage.
“As a safety precaution [the Chilean government] cut the power, so I didn’t have Internet, which is my primary way of communicating with my family,” Meriwether said. “I was afraid they’d hear the news before hearing from me and be really worried. I also didn’t have cell service for a while and couldn’t get in touch with anyone around here.”
Meriwether said she considers herself lucky that her apartment building did not sustain much damage and maintained access to water and power throughout most of the day.
“A lot of people I’ve talked to in the city and around it are without power and water, so I feel pretty lucky [and am] also thankful that my friends are all safe.”
Chilean student Nicole Jullian (SFS ’12), who expects to arrive in Santiago today to see her family, commented on the debilitating effects of the earthquake on her home country.
“The central regions of the country suffered a lot of infrastructural damage. Several buildings in Maipú – poorer area of the capital – collapsed, the airport has received considerable damage, and a couple bridges and highways are in very bad shape,” Jullian said in an e-mail. “Fortunately, Chile overall is used to having tremors and earthquakes, so the majority of buildings are designed to withstand seismic shifts, but then again 8.8 is really strong.”
Jullian was unable to contact her family for eight hours in the earthquake’s aftermath because of the power outages.
“People that lived closer to the epicenter are really traumatized by the whole event and many of them lost their homes,” Jullian said.
At press time, at least 723 people have been confirmed dead following the earthquake, according to CNN.
The two Georgetown students participating in the Council on International Educational Exchange study abroad program in Santiago, including Meriwether, were told to stay put and observe safety precautions when the earthquake struck.
According to Assistant Director in the Office of International Programs Magdalena Chica-Garzon, who advises for study abroad programs in Latin America, students studying in Santiago were nearing the end of orientation and were scheduled to start classes this or next week, though classes have now been delayed.
“CIEE students, including those from [Georgetown], are accounted for and are safe with their host families,” Chica-Garzon said.
Students participating in the CIEE program in Valparaíso were scheduled to arrive on-site yesterday; however, the start of the program has now been delayed until ground conditions are fully assessed and Universidad Católica de Valparaíso adjusts its academic calendar.
Chile has sought to recover amid aftershocks, and President Michelle Bachelet has said the country is in a “state of catastrophe.” The Chilean government first asked for foreign aid on Monday, according to The New York Times.
“Obviously the earthquake will have an impact on the economy,” said Barbara Kotschwar, adjunct professor of Latin American Studies. “I think it is early yet to be able to assess the impact on the infrastructure and the populace – but not nearly so much as, for example, in Haiti, as Chile has done much better in terms of meeting and enforcing building codes and planning for such a disaster. The fact that the quake hit so close to two major metropolitan areas increases the impact on the economy.”
Although restoration efforts will pose a challenge for the nation, Kotschwar noted that the Chilean government is very organized in its reponse and that it has established reliable bonds with other countries that will prove assets in the process.
“The professionals in charge of Chile’s trade promotion strategy work very closely with Chilean business and diplomats and forge close links and establish ties of trust with the local community,” Kotschwar said. “I am sure that this will help them garner targeted assistance of the type that could best help them in this case. I would look for some very well-organized initiatives very soon.”
An earthquake of this magnitude is capable of producing deadly tsunamis, such as the one that followed the Indian Ocean earthquake in 2004. This 8.8 magnitude quake, the epicenter of which was near the city of Concepción, south of Santiago, triggered tsunami warnings throughout Latin America and as far away as Hawaii, Japan, Australia and Russia.
Sierra Jansen (NHS ’11), originally from Maui, feared for the safety of her family in Hawaii.
“While my immediate family is not on-island, [Saturday] was a bit nerve-wracking,” Jansen said. “My family’s house is upcountry, thus our house was safe. However, many of my friends live near the beach and if anything had happened, everything would have been destroyed. I was just hoping that they were able to get to higher ground, especially those who lived in rural areas.”
Jansen said people prepared for the potential tsunami by stocking up on groceries and gasoline. “The tsunami sirens were going off and making everyone acutely aware of what they were waiting for. People who lived upcountry took in those who lived in the flood zone,” she said.
Due to the severity of the quake, CIEE, which operates the study abroad programs offered to Georgetown students, was unable to comment on the current state of its programs.”

The U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council hosted a reception Monday night to facilitate the ongoing discussion and creation of student initiatives focusing on the women of Afghanistan. Over 50 students, faculty, graduate students and community members attended the event in the Philodemic Room aimed to expose the greater community to networking opportunities related to their interests in Afghanistan.
The U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council is a public-private partnership established to utilize public and private sector resources to empower Afghan women. University President John J. DeGioia was appointed co-chair in 2009 when the council moved to Georgetown University.
Organized by Phyllis Magrab, the director of the Center for Child and Human Development and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization chair, who leads the consortium of Georgetown’s program of U.S.-Afghan Women’s Council, Kelly Krohn (SFS ’13) and the Lecture Fund, the event focused on networking and pursuing initiatives with the members of the Georgetown community invested in the future of Afghanistan.
Krohn said, “Our goal is to get all components of Georgetown interested in [Afghanistan] . we hope to start a formalized student group here at Georgetown.”
Afghan student Rafi Khetab (SFS ’12) is working with Krohn to bring their vision of a student organization devoted to Afghanistan to life. After detailing the dangerous interaction with the Taliban that he endured on his trip to obtain a student visa to study here, Khetab stressed to the audience the significance of education to the Afghan people.
“Afghanistan unfortunately is suffering greatly from a lack of educational opportunities . Anything we can do to help them improve their education will make a great difference in their lives, and the future of the country depends on it,” he said.
Magrab said her goal for the evening was to form a network of students motivated to innovate change in Afghanistan, as part of a push for increased enthusiasm among students in addressing the many issues facing the Afghan people today.
Ambassador Steve Steiner, senior adviser in the Department of State’s Office of Global Women’s Issues, said of the United States’ view, “We are looking to empower women all over the world, and Afghanistan is a huge priority. We want to get it right there, and to get it right we want to help women help themselves.”
The council’s executive director, Eva Weigold Schultz, said that the council would love to bring the community into the council as new members, as “there is such a universe of opportunities to engage in – from mentoring to research to anything you would like to offer.”
Several faculty members attended the event, including Associate Professor of Communication, Culture and Technology Master’s Program J. P. Singh and Carol Lancaster, interim dean and professor of politics for the School of Foreign Service.
Some of the students and graduate students in attendance were already nonprofit start-ups. David Lee (NHS ’11) launched the initiative Stinky Peace through his nonprofit Sanitation NOW, New Opportunities for Women, which creates jobs and development opportunities for women and children with operations in Afghanistan, India, Bangladesh and Kenya. He said, “I think this was great how we brought in so many faculty and students today . This was a very successful event.”
Heidi Schaler, the executive director of Friends of the American University of Afghanistan, spoke of the 4-year-old American University of Afghanistan’s dire need of basic supplies, such as pens and uniforms for its sports teams. Reiterating the importance of such a high percentage of women attending their school, a number over 20 percent, Schaler said she would love to work with anyone at Georgetown and suggested several fundraising events, such as a book drive and cover charges at networking events like Thursday’s event.
Concerned community member Mati Arsala said he was very impressed by the amount of interest in the problems of Afghanistan here at Georgetown. Speaking as an Afghan-American and a Maryland resident, he said, “I have seen a lot – women are treated over there as second and even third class citizens. We can do better than that.”
Beth Goldberg (SFS ’12), a student intrigued by the precarious situations in countries like Somalia and Afghanistan, said, “I thought it was a good culmination of minds and good networking opportunities.”
Students who are interested in getting involved were welcomed to contact Magrab, Krohn or Khetab.

Former president of India Abdul Kalam addressed an almost full Lohrfink Auditorium Monday, calling on those in attendance to have an aim in life and to strive relentlessly to attain it.
A world-renowned scientist and the president of India from 2002 to 2007, Kalam came to Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business on Monday evening to speak not of science or of politics, but of how to approach one’s life and career. He divided his speech into the topics of life, progress, challenges and growth.
After beginning his talk with a discussion of India’s space program, Kalam went on to praise Georgetown as an institution of excellence that educates the whole person and not just the mind.
Speaking as a part of the MSB Distinguished Leaders Series, Kalam emphasized that before entering a professional career, it is essential to have a unique aim in life. Kalam related how he developed his own unique aim in life of working in flight and aeronautics as a 10-year-old boy when his schoolteacher took his class to the beach to learn how birds fly. From that point on, Kalam said he knew he wanted to fly.
“It is a matter of great privilege that you are all a part of an institution [that] is known all over the world for the knowledge and enlightenment it provides. It is now your duty to make the best use of the resources [at Georgetown] . Knowledge will give you greatness and will help you to accomplish difficult missions in life,” Kalam said.
Kalam went on to talk of the value of hard work and perseverance as he drew on his own education experience at the Madras Institute of Technology and on his work with the Indian space program. Kalam also described the character of a leader and addressed his message specifically to the MSB students pursuing a major in management. He said that a true leader is someone who takes responsibility in the face of failure and attributes all his success to his team members.
Kalam concluded his remarks by asking students in the audience how they will be remembered.
“What would you like to be remembered for? … Will you be remembered for creating one of the top Fortune 500 companies? … Will you be remembered for doubling the food production of the world?” Kalam said.
Following his speech, the former president took a number of questions and was pressed on issues such as India’s education system, the Indian-Pakistani relationship and India’s future economic development. When asked how Indian students studying in the United States could help their homeland, Kalam said that they must learn the skill of entrepreneurship in the United States as a means of spawning jobs when they return home.
“Come to India not as the employment seeker but as the employment generator,” Kalam said.
Ishana Rai (MSB ’10), a native of New Delhi, said that Kalam’s advice about becoming an “employment generator” was the best line of his talk. She was also impressed by Kalam’s very direct responses to the students’ questions, especially when a student brought up the issue of India’s relationship with Pakistan.
Ronak Parikh (MSB ’12) shared Rai’s sentiments and admired the way Kalam did not dance around issues, though he said Kalam had to retain a political role.
“He is very tactful. He answers in a clear-cut way and doesn’t dance around a lot of questions, but he’s very political as obviously he has to be,” Parikh said.

On the first day of classes for the fall 2009 semester, students in the McDonough School of Business no longer departed for five separate classroom buildings on campus and instead convened in the new Rafik B. Hariri building. As we approach the end of the inaugural academic year of the new home of the MSB, students and administrators expressed satisfaction with the new building, but maintain that there is still room for growth for the program.
“Coming together under one roof provides us with the unified space we need to build on our community of achievement that focuses on developing leaders with a global mindset,” Chris Kormis, the MSB’s associate dean for marketing and communications, said in an e-mail.
Kormis said that the new building offers abundant new spaces including 15 classrooms, 34 breakout rooms and a 400-seat auditorium.
The expansion of the business school’s facilities has allowed for significant improvements to existing programs such as the distinguished leader series, according to Ronak Parikh (MSB ’12). Speakers this year have included Richard Branson, Ted Leonsis and former president of India Abdul Kalam.
The new facilities have also improved the academic experience for students, said Lowell Karr (MSB ’11), president of the MSB Academic Council. Karr cited the building’s technology as being helpful in creating a better working environment.
“The building is essentially state of the art in terms of quality and technical aspects. Every breakout room has a large TV that can be connected to a laptop, helping groups better work on their projects and produce better work,” Karr said.
The new building helped to boost the MSB’s undergraduate program ranking to 23rd in the nation this year, one spot up from 2009.While administrators are pleased with the climb in the rankings, students said that the limitations of the curriculum could be a cause for the MSB not being ranked higher.
“Georgetown focuses heavily on finance and to an extent accounting, and not much on majors like marketing, management, international business or operations management,” Parikh said. “We have an exceptional faculty, but the diversity of course selection does not match that of [schools like] NYU.”
While students expressed some dissatisfaction with the curriculum, the main area needing improvement for the MSB seems to lie in assisting students in planning for the future. According to the Career Center’s senior survey from the Class of 2009, 76 percent of MSB graduates found employment after graduation. Eleven percent are still seeking employment. Nine percent went to graduate or professional school.
Parikh said that the MSB had not provided him with guidance about pursuing a master’s degree. Norean Sharpe, an associate dean in the MSB, said that the MSB trains students for professional development, citing the Alumni Mentor Program, which allows for alumni to give career advice to juniors and seniors doing summer internships in D.C. and New York City, and the Professional Development Series, a series of pre-professional panels.
“Judging from the number of internships our juniors obtain, I believe that Georgetown’s McDonough School of Business provides an excellent academic foundation and an extensive alumni network for our students,” Sharpe said.
Students are not entirely convinced of the effectiveness of these initiatives, however, which are mainly geared towards juniors and seniors.
“From what I’ve heard, [the MSB] doesn’t give you direct support with the job search,” Parikh said. “I feel that the MSB should also assist in this aspect of business students’ lives. Much of the success students have with internships is on their own merit or through family or alumni connections.”
Karr said that the MSB is effective in helping people find internships, but indicated that this is largely the result of guidance from faculty.
“The MSB is very good at preparing students to find business jobs and internships. Faculty are an amazing resource for students to help them with contacts, references and advice on how to help get such a job,” Karr said.

Teach For America, one of the most popular post-graduation options for Georgetown students, won a $50 million grant this month, which will enable it to double the number of educators in its corps by 2014. Forty-one members of Georgetown’s Class of 2010 joined the TFA’s group of 4,500 instructors this year.
Although more graduating seniors joined TFA in the previous two years, with 53 joining in 2009 and 45 in 2008, Georgetown remains one of the biggest feeder schools to TFA. Georgetown has been involved with TFA since the onset of the organization in 1990, when six Hoyas joined its ranks. As of September of this year, an estimated 364 Georgetown alumni are involved with TFA or have completed the program.
“There is a strong commitment to service among the student body,” said Amanda Mills, senior recruitment director for Teach For America, in an email. “Georgetown students truly embrace `Men and Women for others’ and . they are seeking those opportunities to be truly challenged and work relentlessly to ensure opportunities for students across America.”
Brian Cook (COL ’10), who pursued a double major in sociology and English, joined TFA this fall and now teaches eighth-grade English at Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Temple Hills, Md. Cook originally planned on going to law school upon graduation, but midway through senior year, he began to think about TFA.
“On campus, I’d been really passionate about social justice issues, and so issues of equity on campus [were] important [to me], and it was only natural that I was looking for something that I’d be able to work toward a national goal and make changes on a local level,” Cook said.
Despite the raving reviews TFA receives at Georgetown, recent articles in national media have criticized the impact of the organization. An article in The Washington Post noted concerns over the quality of educators produced by TFA. Critics of the program are mainly concerned that the five-week intensive summer training course all new teachers undergo before hitting the classrooms is not enough to transform recent graduates into quality educators. Indeed, educators like Cook sometimes have some experience in education before joining Teach For America. In 2009, Cook started Black Leadership Summer Experience, a summer camp that brought 10 students from Maryland’s Montgomery County public schools to Georgetown for one week of seminars taught by Georgetown professors, other student leaders and guest speakers. The camp focused on black leadership and heritage and college preparatory skills. Cook has been able to apply what he has learned from developing the camp now that he has joined TFA.
Cook recognized the concerns over the training at TFA, but said he believes that the TFA corps ultimately does more good than harm.
“The key word here is `urgency.’ The time is very limited to make the kind of gains to have [students] ready for high school and . have them college-ready,” Cook said. “It’s a serious challenge because the [overall] mission is to change hearts and minds, but the day-to-day challenge is to change behavior. The ultimate goal is to change their outlook and their families’ outlooks on education and what it can do for their lives.”
TFA officials said that the criticism was unwarranted. Kaitlin Gastrock, TFA’s regional spokeswoman, stressed that those five weeks are just the beginning of training for TFA teachers.
“[T]raining continues once the school year begins and throughout their two-year commitment with regular professional development from experienced mentors and coaches,” Gastrock said. “Generally, the model [of training] we have honed is making an impact.”
Despite these methods, some find it troubling that almost half of the instructors leave the organization upon completion of the mandatory two-year commitment, creating concern that instructors left before their participation can have a real impact on students.
A study conducted by the Urban Institute in 2008 found positive conclusions to TFA’s training method, however.
“The findings . suggest that programs like TFA that focus on recruiting and selecting academically talented recent college graduates and placing them in schools serving disadvantaged students can help reduce the achievement gap, even if teachers stay in teaching only a few years,” the study said.
Cook believes the biggest problem is getting enough teachers, whether they are a part of TFA or not, into schools.
“We need people who are willing to sprint as opposed to jog, and we need teachers who are willing to stay beyond their two years and use framework, use data – and adjust things to meet their goals . to make sure our students are reaching higher levels,” Cook said.
Steve de Man (COL ’04), who now does administrative work for TFA, mentioned the impact that Georgetown has had on TFA’s development over the years.
“We are all over the country, including the Teach For America Executive Directors in San Antonio, Indianapolis, Alabama. We have a strong presence of Hoyas on the recruitment team, marketing, alumni affairs and program,”Wde Man wrote in an email. “No other school represents staff like Georgetown.”
Cook was fully supportive of Georgetown’s active role in sending graduates on to join TFA.
“Georgetown creates the type of leader that can bring these things together, and we should absolutely [continue] trying to be leaders [in supporting Teach For America],” Cook said.”

On Monday, September 13, 2010, the Center for Peace and Security Studies hosted a discussion on the START Treaty. One of the two people invited was Richard Burt, the U.S. Chair of Global Zero, a group dedicated to reducing the number of nuclear weapons to zero. The very first person to ask a question to the panel was Dane Shikman (SFS ’13), the executive director of the Georgetown University branch of Global Zero. After the discussion, Shikman agreed to an interview with The Hoya.
What motivated the foundation of the Global Zero chapter at Georgetown University?
Global Zero movement has been gaining steam with North Korea testing their nuclear weapons and with Iran testing their nuclear capabilities, and that has given us the momentum to step up to the plate and to face these proliferation issues in a new way, saying that deterrence is the only way to combat nuclear proliferation, and that the only truly safe world is one in which nuclear weapons do not exist, or if they’re heavily monitored. On a national level, the Global Zero leaders decided that they wanted to form a grass-roots organization, rather than everything coming from the top down.
Why should people be motivated to fight for non-proliferation in this time-period, in the post-Cold War era?
The risk of nuclear weapons is vague. None of us can see it, New York or Washington D.C. being destroyed. We can’t envision it, and we don’t want to envision it. We have a habit of thinking that it’s not real. But if you talk to generals, they will tell you that there are terrorists that are hell bent to deliver nuclear weapons to New York City.
The threat is real. You have North Korea, which is continuing to defy the world, and Iran, which may develop a nuclear weapon in the next couple years, or even months. You have this new security environment, different from what existed in the Cold War. In this one, you can’t have huge numbers of nuclear weapons that can be easily accessed. The risk of nuclear catastrophe outweighs any of the benefits that used to exist during the Cold War.
Nuclear weapons are considered the ultimate deterrence. Why would the United States surrender the “ultimate weapon”?
The United States is the nation that needs nuclear weapons the least, because we have the strongest conventional armed forces in the world. We have extremely precise warheads that are not nuclear. Therefore, the issue of defense lies not with the United States, but with smaller states, which believe that nuclear weapons would be a deterrent. Nuclear deterrence, though, has been partially debunked, because if you look at multiple situations, you’ll see that nukes did not deter attacks, such as with Israel in the 1973 war, or the coalition forces during the First Gulf War. They knew that those nations had nuclear weapons, and that debunks the idea that nukes will prevent any form of attack against a nation.
How realistic do you think a world with no nukes is?
It will require international cooperation that we’ve never seen before, at an unprecedented level, that they’ve never been forced to do before. It will be very difficult, requiring the resolution of regional conflicts such as in Korea, or between Pakistan and India, and making sure that nations like Israel feel safe, so it’s going to be very hard, but we’ve done hard things, things we thought were impossible, like the United Nations. Therefore, us telling ourselves that it’s impossible is making that idea true. The more we say it’s futile, the less energy [we] put into making it a reality. The framework is there, with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which would just need extended powers to be a strong inspection force to be very effective. It’s about changing the paradigm of nations [to] one of trust.
Would there be a point of compromise that would be acceptable to your group?
If you have more nuclear weapons, then there’s more availability, and less safety. There’s a negative correlation between the number of weapons and the safety of the world. Optimally, we would have zero. However, I would prefer a world with fewer nuclear weapons than the world we have currently, but only in a world with no nuclear weapons would there be total safety.
Some politicians are making the START Treaty a political issue, accusing senators who vote for ratification of being soft on national security. Is this message affecting the public, and how do you plan on responding?
The political climate is very different from when the first START Treaty was signed. The Republican senators opposed to the treaty are not trying to make Americans safer, they’re trying to oppose President Obama. They’re focused on beating Obama, which creates significant problems with trying to ratify the treaty. It will have to involve grass-roots movements. It’s about convincing people that having large amounts of nuclear weapons is not the best, nor safest option for peace, and even after this bill, we’re still going to have 1,550 nuclear warheads. Even the most warlike of people will have to acknowledge that we still have a lot of nuclear weapons.
Is the non-proliferation movement also an anti-war movement?
Global Zero has nothing to do with conventional military strength. Many times, we actually refer to nation’s conventional forces to argue that they will have enough power to repel attacks, and that wars that are going to be fought should only be fought with conventional weapons. We are not primarily an anti-war group.
What are Global Zero’s plans to remove all nuclear arms from the world?
Global Zero has a step-by-step action plan that would ensure a timeframe. The START Treaty is a big step in that. The next step would be to bring Russia back to the table and make even more drastic cuts to nuclear arms levels. If we cut those all down to 1,000, we can encourage the rest of the world to enter the conversation.
How likely is it that a nuclear bomb will go off during our lifetimes?
I think it’s likely. Realistically speaking, I think it may take a nuclear explosion for the world to realize how serious of a problem nuclear proliferation is. If it happens, either here or in Europe, it might be an explosion that would galvanize everyone to make true steps to cut down on nuclear weapons.

Fifteen alumni and one recent Law Center graduate will venture to points around the globe in the next nine months after receiving the prestigious Fulbright award, according to a Sept. 15 university press release.
The Fulbright Program, which is sponsored by the U.S. government and run through the State Department, provides grants to teach or perform unique research abroad for one academic year.
The Office of University Fellowships at Georgetown, which helps to facilitate the application process for students, said interest in the competitive program is on the rise.
“We’ve had an increase in applications over the past few years, and I hope this continues to be a trend,” said Maryam Mohamed, associate director in the fellowship office.
Forty-eight candidates applied from the main campus and Medical Center for this year’s competition, up from 39 in 2009 and 42 in 2008. The 2011 application cycle is consistent with the trend, with an unofficial total of 57 applicants.
These figures have translated into Fulbright recipients, with 15 winners in 2009 and 18 in 2008. That’s up from nine in 2007 and just three the school produced in 2006.
ohamed believes students have been particularly successful at obtaining these grants because of the university’s strong programs in undergraduate research, extracurricular teaching opportunities that give students experience in a classroom setting, and the number of students who study abroad.
“One of the biggest misconceptions is that [the Fulbright program] is GPA-centric,” Mohamed said. She stressed that review committees are more concerned with whether or not students have cultivated the skills necessary to carry out their project proposals or teaching assignments.
Emily Langer (COL ’06), one of this year’s winners, successfully demonstrated her abilities and level of experience. An Italian and English double major, Langer will set off for Trieste, Italy, next month to conduct research on the sole Nazi concentration camp that operated in the country.
Before receiving the grant, Langer had conducted research in Trieste as a Lisa J. Raines fellow as an undergraduate. She plans to use her time as a Fulbright scholar to conduct the research necessary to write a book in English about the history of the concentration camp and the city’s reaction to it, both past and present.
“I always knew I was fascinated by this place,” said Langer, who is taking a leave of absence from her position at The Washington Post to pursue the project.
According to its website, the Fulbright program aims to “increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries.”
Langer’s intention is similar. For her first experience in Trieste, locals welcomed her and shared their memories of World War II and the concentration camp that operated right outside their doors.
Patrick Dowd (SFS ’09), another recipient this year, is conducting research on a project he titled “Out with the Old, in with the New: Exploring India’s Emerging E-waste Landscapes.” E-waste, or discarded electronic and electrical equipment, is a distinctly modern phenomenon that is ballooning into a serious environmental concern, according to Dowd.
In conjunction with the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad, Dowd’s project includes conducting research on the contemporary approach to the issue. He will work on developing a business plan that addresses all aspects of e-waste, from legal issues to environmental standards.
Dowd, who served as president of Georgetown University Student Association during the 2008-2009 term said he believes everyone should be paying close attention to this area of the world.
“India is a country that ought to be on every single Georgetown student’s radar,” Dowd said in an email. “I believe that India, in spite of the many challenges it faces, is destined to become one of the 21st century’s most influential leading nations.”
Other Fulbright scholars hailing from the Hilltop will spearhead a diverse array of research projects this year, from studying artistic groups in Germany to climate change in Africa to religion and national identity issues in Oman.
All of the projects delve in academic research, but the human element of this exchange program is not lost on the grant recipients.
“My priority is talking to and learning from the people of Trieste,” Langer said. “I hope I give them a chance to tell me something really important about their lives.”
Langer and Dowd are joined by 13 other main campus winners: Abed Bhuyan (SFS ’08), Laura Cocas (GRD ’11), Angela Crandall (SFS ’10), John D’Angola (MSB ’10), Grace Erdmann (COL ’10), Jay Gonzalez (COL ’09), Maria Iliakova (GRD ’10), Courtney Ivins (SFS ’10), Aakib Khaled (COL ’10), Jess Kuntz (SCS ’10), Moises Mendoza (SFS ’07),

World Bank Group President Robert Zoellick unveiled a new research plan and slogan for the World Bank in Gaston Hall on Wednesday morning before an audience of students and faculty.
School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster introduced Zoellick to a less-than-full Gaston, though more students trickled in throughout the lecture.
In her introduction, Lancaster noted the importance of Zoellick’s role in world affairs, especially in the buildup to the World Bank meetings set to take place in Washington, D.C., Oct. 8 to 10.
The World Bank, according to its mission statement, seeks to reduce poverty worldwide by furthering what their website characterizes as sustainable and inclusive globalization.
Zoellick invoked George Bernard Shaw, playwright and co-founder of the London School of Economics, at the outset of his speech. “If all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion,” he quipped.
“Economics has contributed significantly to how we understand our world,” Zoellick said. “But economics doesn’t always get it right.”
Zoellick emphasized the need for a global economic dialogue.
“One of the things we’re trying to do more broadly at the [World] Bank is capture [much] of the knowledge and experiences we have from people in the developed world but broaden the set of people asking these questions and how we think about them,” Zoellick said.
He added that he believed the need for an economic agenda that includes the input of people from across the globe was accentuated by the pressures of today’s economic crises.
“Indeed, [economics] can get things spectacularly wrong,” he said, pointing to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis as an example of just how flawed economics with a limited scope can be.
Zoellick framed his argument and the basis of the World Bank’s new strategy in the history of development economics and its recent failures, which he attributed to too narrow a focus in the field.
For example, he said, in the 1950s,
economists believed that all emerging markets needed was an injection of capital and even today, China and India have serious concerns regarding agriculture and infrastructure even though they are becoming market leaders. He also cited the likely failure to meet many of the Millennium Development Goals, quantitative measures adopted by world leaders in 2000 to eradicate world poverty by 2015.
These shortcomings, Zoellick said, require a radical re-examination of some of the most basic principles of development economics, including a better understanding of “economic transformation,” a push for inclusive development, and a comprehensive plan to deal with economic risks.
The speech also revealed a new slogan for the World Bank’s research: “Open Data, Open Knowledge, Open Solutions.”
The bespectacled Zoellick became markedly more animated after he had finished his prepared remarks, and he responded first to a question from Lancaster about the “revolutionary” nature of his speech, which advocated a fundamentally different and ostensibly controversial open-source approach to developmental economics.”

Born deaf to parents who are deaf and the product of a bilingual household communicating in both English and American Sign Language, Carol Padden is a 1978 graduate of Georgetown, where she pursued a major in linguistics and an minor in psychology. After graduating from the university, she earned a doctorate in linguistics from the University of California, San Diego, and has been a professor there since 1983. Padden’s research focuses on sign language structure and deaf culture and community, and she received a boost recently when she was named a 2010 MacArthur Foundation “genius award” winner, for which she will receive a $500,000 grant to use at her discretion. THE HOYA caught up with Padden over the phone in between conference stops in Indianapolis and Denmark to hear about her time at Georgetown, her work and what she plans to do with the unexpected grant.
 
 
 
You were born deaf to parents who are deaf and say you were raised in deaf culture – what was it like to enter public school for the first time at age 8 and be totally immersed in the hearing world for the first time?
 
 
 
It was a bit of a culture shock, I’ll say that. I had been going to a deaf school where there were small classes before [I attended] public schools. It was just a matter of adjusting to a very different type of educational setting. I didn’t have an interpreter – they didn’t provide interpreters until after I graduated high school. It was [difficult] trying to learn spoken English well enough to get along in a new school, to make friends. My family and I had decided to try it for one year on a trial basis and if it didn’t work out I could go back. But I guess it worked out. I remained at my neighborhood school until I graduated in 1973.
 
 
 
 
 
As a member of the deaf community, what inspired you to devote your professional and academic career to studying deaf culture and signed languages?
 
 
 
I’ve always wanted to explain something that was unusual and show how it was completely ordinary at the same time. I don’t like to describe something as exotic or special. I’ve always wanted to describe a way of life that I think is completely ordinary and explain how a sign language can develop.
 
 
 
What was your favorite aspect of Georgetown while you were here?
 
 
 
Well, I have to say the linguistics department was what I was looking for . solid training in linguistics. It was a fairly new discipline at the time I started in 1974. Ideas were changing about language and cognition. There was a lot more emphasis on thinking about language and mind and the theoretical aspects of language. Not just descriptions of language but on how humans view language, how we acquire competence, and how language changes over time. Georgetown was one of the best places to get training in that area, so I decided I’d move back home, transfer to Georgetown, and I was just delighted I was accepted. I was maybe 19. I was absolutely certain this was what I wanted my career to be, and the training I got prepared me really well for graduate school.
 
 
 
I’ve been in a faculty position at the University of California, San Diego, now for 27 years – it just doesn’t feel that long. It’s just an exciting place to be. I think having the solid background I got from Georgetown made all of that possible.
 
 
 
 
 
What went through your head when you found out you won a MacArthur “genius grant”?
 
 
 
You know I was doing something completely trivial when my phone rang. The interpreter came on and said that a man was calling from the MacArthur Foundation, so I had a few moments of confusion thinking, `Why would they be calling me?’ Then he asked me if I was alone. It felt like a lightning bolt. I was just completely and utterly caught off guard. I didn’t expect it at all. And then when he told me about the award, I couldn’t think of anything to say. The interpreter sat there and I couldn’t think of anything else to say. I was of course very happy and very, very surprised. And they went on and said I could tell one other person and just one person, so of course I had to tell my husband. I couldn’t tell my parents, I couldn’t tell my daughter. So after I hung up, I called my husband and I told him what I had won, and, you know, he threw up his hands and he covered his eyes and said, `Oh my God, I can’t believe this! This is wonderful! This is spectacular!’ And I thought, `That was the reaction I should have had!’ I was completely, completely stunned.
 
 
 
 
 
One of the most unique and important aspects of the grant is that it comes “no strings attached” – there is no reporting to do or hoops to jump through. Does this type of freedom inspire creativity and new ways of thinking or do you find it difficult to manage?
 
 
 
ost people get this grant at the beginning of their career. I’m getting it at what I think is one of the most exciting times in my career, and I can’t think of better timing. I’ve had a lot of ideas about looking at new sign languages in different places. I’m interested in modeling how languages emerge, develop and become conventionalized.
 
 
 
I’ve had a lot of ideas over the years, and I think, `You know, that’s pretty hard to get funding for’ or I don’t have it entirely worked out. You’re given the freedom to write, think about new directions, and maybe poke a little deeper into an idea you’ve just developed. You can even develop an entirely new direction in your work. It’s just a tremendous opportunity, and I’m very glad to have it at this point in my career.
 
 
 
 
 
What do you hope to accomplish after utilizing the MacArthur grant?
 
 
 
You know, I don’t have a grand plan right now. I want to do it step by step. I usually start with an observation or something that sort of captures my eye and I think how does that work? How would I explain it? What kind of theoretical apparatus would I need to make this come to life? So I really do my work step by step.
You really need to make clear about where you’re going and what steps to take next. I’ve always done that, so this is something I saw, maybe out in the field, an unusual way of using sign language and I think: `Why did they do that? Why did something like this come about? What would I need to be able to define it? So I will come back and play in my laboratory and think about who I need to talk to. What do I need to read? What do I need to learn in order to describe these things that I just observed?’
 
 
 
And then I start to put it together and I start to make a story out of it. Sometimes it becomes a book. Sometimes it becomes a series of articles. Sometimes it becomes a grant. I’ve been doing this long enough that I have a lot of instincts about what to do next, what to do after that. I try not to get too far ahead of myself. I really try [to] stay focused on an immediate goal in order to achieve a larger one.

Recounting the devastating floods in Pakistan this summer, Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, urged students gathered in the Mortara Center Monday to divert their attention to the ongoing disaster.
Haqqani said that the international response to last July’s floods in Pakistan has been abysmal.
“Pakistan has been unfortunate, and not only in terms of weather,” Haqqani said, beginning a sharp critique of both the media and the international donor community for mishandling the situation in
Pakistan.
With sometimes surprising candor, Haqqani argued that the international response has been lacking because the floods caused few actual deaths.
He said that the total number of people affected by the floods, however, numbers 20 million – more than the number affected by the Haitian earthquake, Indian Ocean tsunami and 2005 earthquake in Pakistan combined. At one time, 20 percent of Pakistan was underwater, an area the size of the entire Eastern seaboard.
“There are times when our compassion overwhelms our cynicism, and there are times when our cynicism overwhelms our compassion,” he said. “But there is something worse than cynicism at work here.”
Haqqani said that few media outlets actually sent reporters to the affected area, providing minimal and sometimes inaccurate accounts of the floods.
“A story like a flood can really only be told by getting your feet wet – literally,” he said.
Those who did cover the floods, Haqqani said, focused more on the political aspects of the story than anything else.
“What about the human tragedy? What about the suffering?” he asked.
Haqqani, who has spoken at other local universities recently, said he hoped students would help bring greater attention to the issue and convince the private sector to start donating to Pakistan.
“What I expect for them is the raising of awareness,” he said.
orial Shah (SFS ’13), who coordinated the event, said that increasing general knowledge about the floods was her primary goal. Shah was in Pakistan during the summer when the flooding began, and she spent three weeks on the ground with a nonprofit organization helping to coordinate disaster relief.
When she returned to campus in the fall, Shah helped found the GU Pakistan Flood Relief Task Force. Shah said that she was initially disheartened by the number of students who did not know about the flooding.
While promoting yesterday’s event, however, Shah noticed a dramatic change. Only one person she talked to didn’t know about the disaster, and strangers even helped her put up posters and said they were interested.
“That was very encouraging to me,” Shah said. She was especially happy to see greater involvement from people who had no previous connections to South Asia.
For Nick Albanese (SFS ’14), Haqqani’s lecture served as a chance to learn more about a crisis that he admitted he had not followed closely.
“I didn’t really know much about the situation in Pakistan,” Albanese said, adding that he found Haqqani’s perspective on the media most interesting.
ary Nancy Walter (COL ’14) said she had discussed the floods with Pakistani friends but wanted to hear the ambassador’s perspective.
For Shah, who grew up in rural Pakistan, the biggest concern is that people will begin to forget about the floods.
“People don’t feel the urgency anymore,” she said. “But I still feel the urgency.”

Smithsonian museum regulars might need to start dipping into their pockets soon if a new budget proposal is passed. President Obama’s deficit reduction commission proposed admissions fees at the Smithsonian museums last week in order to reduce congressional spending. The suggested $7.50 per visitor would decrease congressional spending by $225 million.
The Smithsonian museum system, which includes the National Art Gallery and the American History Museum, has been free to the public since 1846. According to Smithsonian officials, the free entry policy allows people to come visit regardless of their economic situation.
“In a sense, Americans already pay to visit the Smithsonian with their tax dollars, which provide about two-thirds of the Smithsonian’s annual budget. Because there is no admission fee, people are able to see their national treasures, participate in educational programs and visit exhibitions regardless of their ability to pay,” Smithsonian officials said in a news release in response to the suggested budget changes Nov. 12.
According to Sheila Burke, former deputy secretary and chief operating officer of the Smithsonian Institution, the laws by which the National American Indian Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden were created forbid admission fees. The Freer Gallery of Art is also required to remain free of charge, as stipulated in Charles Lang Freer’s will.
The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform based its calculations of savings and suggested fees on the reported 30 million patrons who visit Smithsonian museums annually. However, the Smithsonian Institution argues that it is instead 30 million visits, not individual visitors, that the museums receive each year.
According to Smithsonian officials, the report by the National Commission also failed to consider the potential decrease in visitors that the Smithsonian could face if museum fees were implemented.
“[Admission fees] would not only deprive many families of the benefit they have earned with their tax dollars, but would also have a negative impact on the business income earned in the Smithsonian’s museum shops, restaurants and theaters,” the Smithsonian Institute said.
Suggestions similar to commission proposal have been presented at congressional hearings in the past, but none have received the support of the public or the Smithsonian Board of Regents.
Many members of Congress have also voiced opposition it the past. In 2008, Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) announced that he would fight “tooth and nail” against all proposed Smithsonian admission fees.
“I don’t think we want to do that to Americans because what we possess is not only fabulous but hallowed,” he told The Washington Post. “Anyone who wants to charge, you have to walk through me.”

Lee Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore, said that his political model for the state could only be achieved in small countries. Precise as ever, he stated that in countries larger than Jamaica his model of rule of law would not hold the population in lock-step. His remark tells us two things about promoting development: First, no model can be universally applied to non-democratic states; second, only with exceptionally tight control can democratization be slowed to a crawl. Promoting sequencing promotes leaders like Lee Kuan Yew; men whose goal is to maintain law and order with no dissent. Thomas Jefferson claimed that dissent is an integral part of good government. If so, the much lauded anti-democratic model of development is a step in the wrong direction.
As Thomas Carothers argues, the dream is sequencing: that a benevolent elderly sage will gracefully lead his country to democracy, and like Nelson Mandela, relinquish power come the end of his term in office. A quick glance around the world reveals the fallacy of this method – Egypt’s president Hosni Mubarak imposes strict and narrow limits on political activity in the interest of control and security all the while promising democratic reform. Soon his son Gamal will take the reins of the dynasty. Two case studies of the process sequentialism prioritizes are the Democratic Republic of the Congo first under Patrice Lumumba, then Mobutu Sese Seko, and the Philippines under Ferdinand Marcos, then Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. These two are clear examples of a state trading democratic institutions for rule of law – a trend not sought by democracy-promoters.
There are even `exceptions’ that prove to be the norm – most widely heralded is South Korea’s slow, `steady’ democratization. But this transition was more similar to the populist overthrow of Marcos in the Philippines than the sequentialist dream of democracy evolving out of rule of law. South Korea’s gradually more liberal dictators Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo succumbed to public pressure, eventually leading to the presidency of Kim Young-sam.
South Korea, the Philippines, Democratic Republican of the Congo and Egypt show what follows from prioritizing rule of law above democratization. The contrasting example of Mandela respecting the democratic norm of relinquishing power shows us much about the legitimacy of a regime, both to domestic and international observers. Vladimir Putin’s `dictatorship of law’; today faced by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is a pertinent example of this trend in action. It does not lead to democracy, and, as the International Relations Club’s U.S. Foreign Policy Debate addressed this afternoon in White-Gravenor, it achieves neither security nor development.
andela relinquishing power set a powerful example across Africa, one that resonates across Botswana, Mauritius, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania and Kenya. The latter two, formerly British colonies, are examples of how post-colonial transitions to independence function as democratic transition processes. The British, unlike the Dutch and French, were fond of creating democratic institutions in their colonies. People’s assemblies like the Indian National Congress were emblems of British benevolence; they believed their role was not purely to subjugate but also to civilize. To the British, it was key that democracy was operative so that upon becoming independent, the new states could function successfully.
The Congo, Indonesia, the Philippines and Algeria are all examples of colonial transitions in which a state attained independence without a long-running democratic framework ready to take over. Unsurprisingly, they all fell to military rule or cult of personality authoritarianism. One can argue that the colonial experience of India is case-in-point for sequencing, but to do so is to ignore the historical narrative. The former Viceroy of India, Louis Mountbatten, oversaw the transition, as we would call it today, with greater Indian autonomy and finally, a British departure. Cases like Egypt under Mubarak are different because Mubarak will not leave office within his term limits.
Sequencing neither works as a process towards democracy, nor as a guarantee of civil society under political stability. It has a high frequency of resulting in repressive authoritarianism, as modern Russia shows, particularly with violations of human rights, as Anna Politkovskaya’s death frighteningly reveals. The example of India’s democratization is arguably a glimmer of hope, but as Lee Kuan Yew’s point about the Singaporean model shows, no example can be universalized into a typology that both serves all circumstances and fits them well. As the United States undertakes its first quadrennial diplomatic review we must bear in mind what priorities are most needed. Eschewing the full gamut of state responsibility for strategic effectiveness and results now only means a sloppy job and further strife.

Inside the newest building on campus sits an electronic haven stocked with the advancements of the 21st century and staffed by students with a passion for technology.
While the rest of the university community relies on University Information Services, the McDonough School of Business Technology Center provides technology solutions for business school undergraduate students and MBA students.
SB Chief Technology Officer John Carpenter said the business school needs to have its own technology center in order to retain an edge over its peers.
“There are a lot of things that the school of business has to do to compete with other business schools across the nation and in the world, and some of those things are technology,” Carpenter said. “It’s the same thing for the Medical Center. It’s the same thing for the Law [Center].”
Carpenter has the final say on all technology matters in the business school. MSB students, faculty and staff know him as Carp, even though his gruff demeanor and abrupt email replies seem to belie the familiarity his nickname creates.
A former Navy pilot who specialized in Navy Technical Intelligence, Carpenter describes himself as “real old,” though he says the undergraduate student staff keeps him abreast of changing uses for technology since his arrival 17 years ago.
The MSB had a tech center before the rest of the university did, according to Carpenter. In its early years, it provided networking for the university and email for all faculty and staff. At the time Carpenter was hired, the MSBTC specialized in technology for business school students that no one else could provide, a condition that still exists today.
Despite his high praise for the tech center’s capabilities, Carpenter hesitated to comment on where technology for the MSBTC is headed. He gave examples, however, of projects that are under consideration.
One such venture is the rollout of Dropbox, an online service that automatically syncs a user’s files across computers, which students could use to work on projects or share group class work. He noted, though, that the Dropbox project was in the earliest of stages and could end up going nowhere. The idea for the project came about after chats with a student staff member.
Undergraduate students who work at MBSTC hail from every school except the School of Nursing and Health Studies and span a variety of majors. Each academic year, a round of new staff is hired. New hires get basic training and then specialize in one of four areas: technology and desk services, audio/visual services, web development or training other staff. Most students specialize in technology and A/V, according to Talia Hamlin (COL ’11), who has worked in the MSBTC since her freshman year.
Hamlin, far from being a computer science geek, majors in anthropology. After a few years on the job, Hamlin is comfortable at the tech center – she casually chats with Carp, she has seen full-time staff members come and go, and most significantly, she saw the transition from the MSBTC’s old homes in the Car Barn and Riverside classrooms to their sleek new Rafik B. Hariri Building headquarters.
“It’s changed so much since I started here and gotten so much more professional,” Hamlin said, noting the uniform blue shirts staff members are now required to wear.
The professional polo does not stop Hamlin from nonchalantly greeting full-time staff members, however.
The lighthearted atmosphere does not interfere with customer service and any time a lost-looking or frustrated MSB student approaches the tech center window, the conversation halts and a student staffer tackles the problem.
Joining Hamlin on one shift were MSBTC staff Ishita Kohli (SFS ’13) and Michael Crouch (MSB ’13).
All three are international students. Hamlin is from Madrid, Spain, Kohli comes from Dubai and India, and Crouch hails from South Africa. They laughed when they realized they all were international students working together and admitted that it was not the norm.
They were not sure what drew all of them to work at the tech center.
“Maybe international students like technology,” Talia said.
“Or maybe we need the money,” Kohli added.

With past guests such as Barack Obama, Aretha Franklin, India.Arie and Brian McKnight, it comes as no shock that this year’s annual “Let Freedom Ring” music celebration was packed full to the brim with hopefuls for a free ticket. Hosted by the Kennedy Center and Georgetown University, this year’s commemoration of the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. was surely a success.
Headlined by platinum-selling and Grammy Award-winning artist Patti LaBelle, musical performances were also given by the Let Freedom Ring Choir, a collaboration between singers from Georgetown, the Metropolitan Baptist Church and the Capitol Hill Seventh-Day Adventist Church. Led by Music Director Reverend Nolan Williams Jr., the choir, along with LaBelle, delivered a show stopping performance.
The spirit of the entire celebration was hopeful, optimistic and humble.
Bringing the spirit of the Hilltop to the celebration, Jarvis Matthews (COL ’12) opened the ceremony and delivered the invocation, focusing on the necessity of peace and equality. Matthews spoke of the need for continued support and prayers for those affected by the 2009 earthquakes that destroyed Haiti and claimed an estimated 300,000 lives. Along with those affected in Haiti, Matthews asked for the support and prayers of the victims of the 2011 shootings in Tucson, Ariz. To end his speech, Matthews led the 2,500 members of the audience in the opening prayer.
After Matthews, University President John J. DeGioia presented Joseph Lowery, a prominent figure in the American civil rights movement and an influential American figure alongside his colleague King, with the ninth annual John Thompson Legacy of a Dream Award. Lowery spoke from the heart and added his own humor: “They told me I had all the time I needed,” said Lowery, “as long as I didn’t take over five minutes.”
Lowery spoke of 2009, when he gave President Barack Obama his benediction and reiterated the emerging belief of many Americans. “Those who come in resistance, steeped in hate, dipped in the venom of racial hostility, we come to say ain’t no way. Ain’t no way!” Lowery said. He concluded with his inspirational message of the coming of a new day “when justice will roll down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream.”
Following a standing ovation for Lowery came the one-and-only Patti LaBelle. LaBelle’s performance brought the audience to its feet, even causing many to rush to the stage to snap a photo of the glamorous and hardly aging diva. After performing an array of musical numbers, LaBelle was still going strong and was convinced to perform a double encore by the enthusiastic applause. Hitting incredible notes, chatting up the ecstatic audience and even taking off her shoes, LaBelle provided an unforgettable experience. Backed by the choir, the two delivered a powerful performance, filled with messages of love, motivation, hope and freedom. A fitting celebration for the wonderful legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.

University President John J. DeGioia has racked up frequent flyer miles this academic year, visiting Britain, Singapore, India, Switzerland, Qatar and Mexico since July.
As his travels take him across the world to speak in scholarly settings and economic forums, DeGioia seeks to propel Georgetown onto the global academic scene.
“What I have tried to do in each of my talks is raise a key theme, which is that we have allowed globalization to be defined in market and economic terms,” DeGioia told The Hoya. “The real contribution of the academy is to bring characteristics of the ethos, the characteristics of the university, to bear on globalization.”
To kick off his summer travels, DeGioia visited Wales in July. There he received an honorary fellowship from Owain Glyndwr University.
During his trip to Singapore in August, he delivered the second annual S.T. Lee Distinguished Lecture on Universities for a Global Society at the National University of Singapore. Lee Bollinger, president of Columbia University, delivered the speech for its debut run last year.
Touching on his broad international experiences, DeGioia explained that every place he visits teaches him something new.
“Each place has its own distinct character and culture with a unique set of questions,” said DeGioia. “The lens in which I explore the different countries and cultures is through the lens of higher education. I tried during my travels to engage my colleagues to discuss the contributions higher education can make to expand the meaning of the term ‘globalization.'”
In November, DeGioia devoted a week to developing higher education in India, heading a delegation of university leaders visiting New Delhi to study the educational infrastructure and seeing the Child Rights Information Center in Badarpur.
Presenting the keynote address at the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, DeGioia spoke on reforms in Indian higher education. Yale University President Richard Levin, Oxford University Chancellor Chris Patten and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers delivered the past few keynote addresses.
DeGioia’s mission to improve higher education abroad is not without reason. The president said that there is a need for 40 million new jobs to meet the demographic trends across the Arab world, for example. In order to meet job demands, higher education has to expand not just in the Middle East but everywhere.  In India, there has been a calculated need for 600 new universities, DeGioia explained.
“What I have tried to do in each of my talks, and there are some similarities and some differences between them, is raise the key theme that there is a need for more higher education,” said DeGioia.
January took him to Davos, Switzerland, where he participated in the World Economic Forum annual meeting. The president also launched his Facebook page that month, and followers could read about the sessions he attended at the conference including “Yes is More: The Architecture of Inclusivism” and “Insights on China.”
On Feb. 15, DeGioia was in Mexico for the board of trustees meeting at the Monterrey Institute of Technology, one of the largest universities in Latin America. There he joined former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, President of Arizona State University Michael Crow and President of the Monterrey Institute of Technology Rafael Rangel Sostmann to discuss the impact of globalization on higher education.
“We must recognize the urgent need to deepen and expand our opportunities for access,” DeGioia said at the conference. “We must leapfrog, using technology to ensure all of our people have access to the learning necessary for participation in a global economy.”
In true jet-setting fashion, DeGioia had arrived in Mexico after coming from Doha, Qatar, where he had celebrated the official opening of the new Georgetown School of Foreign Service-Qatar building in Education City.
The travels forge connections not only with other universities but with Georgetown alumni as well. International alumni clubs, such as the ones in Singapore and New Delhi, have welcomed DeGioia around the globe and 50 members from the New Delhi alumni center honored him with a reception ceremony.
DeGioia’s Facebook page serves as a hub for students and alumni to keep track of the president’s travels. On the page, he writes of his intention for students to “learn more about the privilege I have of representing Georgetown in many different contexts, whether here on the Hilltop, in the city of Washington, D.C., or in various locations around the world.”
The territory covered is vast, in terms of both geography and the topics on tabs, but DeGioia summed up his travels succinctly.
“It’s been a conversation.”

The Department of Education hosted the first ever Voices in Action: National Youth Summit on Saturday to discuss how to make U.S. college graduation levels the highest in the world by 2020.
The summit gave high school and middle school students from around the country the chance to engage in discussion and listen to leaders in U.S. education.
Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who gave the keynote address, said that the White House believes that improving post-secondary school graduation rates and increasing the percentage of Americans with degrees are vital to the country’s future economic success.
“[Today’s young Americans] are competing for jobs with people from India, China, South Korea, Finland,” Duncan said.  “The President believes the countries out-educating us today will out-compete us tomorrow.”
Duncan and other government officials offered up solutions to potential obstacles facing this goal.
One concern revealed in surveys collected during the National Youth Listening Tour in 2010 was the affordability of higher education.
Low-income families who participated in this Education Department initiative expressed frustration with the steady rise of college tuition fees across the nation, according to a video summary of the results shown at the opening of the summit.
In the past decade, many universities, both public and private, have had to increase the price of tuition to deal with inflation and to increase the quality of their programs.
Georgetown’s tuition rate rose by 3 percent from 2010 to 2011 and will increase again by 2.9 percent from 2011 to 2012, according to a Feb. 11 press release. The total cost for two semesters of an undergraduate education, complete with room and board, will reach $53, 910.
Duncan said that students who cannot pay the tuition at traditional four-year universities do have other options. Students might pursue less expensive degrees at three-year programs, community colleges or trade schools.
“I can’t tell you how critically important it is that you make sure we are invested in education, because education is not an expense — it is an investment,” Duncan said.
Other speakers at the event said that to reach the president’s goal, college education and skills advancement must become popular among the nation’s youth.
Kalpen Modi, a well-known actor and the White House liaison to Young Americans, the Arts and Asian American and Pacific Islander Communities, said that today’s students have the power to improve the U.S.’s current educational ranking.
“With the Democrats and Republicans [in Congress and the government] going back and forth, it is easy to forget how young people can change things,” he said.
Modi and Kaya Henderson, interim chancellor of D.C. public schools, both told young people to be unafraid to express their ideas to government leaders and to enact change themselves.
“You know who the best teachers are. You know what curriculum is meeting your needs and getting you ready for the world of college and careers,” Henderson said to the summit. “Demand that from [the government and educators].”

Fashion designer Kenneth Cole announced a partnership with Compass Partners Inc. on Friday, stitching the two organizations together with a $500,000 pledge of financial support.
The deal was made public at the first annual gathering of the Compass Fellows, a group founded at Georgetown and now comprised of over 150 undergraduate students. The Fellows, who study at Georgetown, American University, The George Washington University, Indiana University and Tufts University, are aspiring entrepreneurs interested in business and social justice.
William Huster, brand manager of Compass Partners Inc., and Neil Shah (MSB ’10), co-founder of the fellowship, confirmed that Compass Partners will use Cole’s donation to extend its fellows program to between 12 and 15 schools next fall, including University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University and Fordham University.
The organization will branch out to Boston, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and allow students to regularly exchange ideas, meet and collaborate with other fellows.
Shah said that Compass’ first program, created at Georgetown in 2009, serves as a model for this growth.
“Our original 15 [Fellows] from Georgetown, we had such a close bond. We figured out entrepreneurship was more than just teaching someone about spreadsheets,” Shah said.
Cole said the new affiliation will allow Compass to expand and offer future business leaders more educational opportunities to interact with one another and assist the world around them.
“Together we will seek to identify, encourage and empower the next generation of change agents,” Cole said in a speech to the fellows at the Shift Series conference. “We hope to teach the skills necessary to navigate public, private, for profit [and] not-for-profit universes. The process will encourage the taking down of walls and the building of new state-of-the-art proverbial bridges.”
Huster said that Cole’s monetary contribution of $500,000 will be issued over a span of three years. He added that there is discussion about giving Cole a more active role in the project, possibly by offering him a spot on Compass’ board of directors.
Shah said that he and co-founder Arthur Woods (MSB ’10) first contacted Cole after hearing of his sponsorship of a similar civic engagement project at Columbia University.
When Cole expressed interest in the organization at a meeting in New York City, the two sides entered into six months of talks discussing how their partnership could further the message of social engagement.
Since launching Kenneth Cole Productions Inc. in 1982, the fashion mogul has successfully promoted a host of social issues. Internally, he founded the company’s community outreach initiative, encouraging employees to participate in service opportunities.
He also started the Kenneth Cole Foundation’s ‘Awearness’ program, in which consumers can contribute to causes such as AIDS awareness and tsunami relief efforts in Japan by purchasing items from a specialized line of products.
“Typically in the fashion business, we redefine ourselves every few weeks with new product offerings, but if the brand is more substantive it creates a strong, if not stronger, relationship with the customer,” he said in an interview with The Hoya.
“It makes the relationship itself bigger and more important. That’s something we’ve always sought to do.”
Angela Morabito (SFS ’12), a first-generation Compass Fellow who designed her own line of women’s accessories for her Fellows project, found Cole’s message inspiring and applicable.
“There are plenty of places where you can buy a piece of square fabric, like a scarf,” she said. “What a person wears should be an affirmation of meaning.”
Morabito’s company, Headlines: Smartwear for Smart Women, supports efforts to educate women by donating a portion of its profits to organizations that promote literacy worldwide.
Nick Maida (MSB ’13), one of these original participants, said that the organization’s connection with Cole will prove beneficial for social entrepreneurs on the Hilltop.
“If you look at where Compass was 18 months ago and then look at the growth and success it has enjoyed in such a short time, the sky is the limit. This partnership will assist in that continued expansion,” Maida said.
“As a fellow, this means better access to the resources and support group that makes the Compass fellowship such a success.”

While most students begin courses at Georgetown just months after graduating from high school, some accepted students are opting to take a gap year before embarking on their university careers.
The Wall Street Journal reported in December that a Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles found that 1.2 percent of freshmen at four-year colleges waited a year before enrolling in school.
The choice to take a gap year can reflect a desire to relax after high school, to give meaning and direction to later classroom experiences or to break away from a traditional or limited academic trajectory, according to Georgetown students who took the leap.
For Anne Jamison (SFS ’14), a gap year was a necessary break after four years at an intense high school.
“I really needed a break. … If I’d come to Georgetown straight from high school I would have been burned out,” she said.
After a year abroad as an outdoor education teaching assistant in Australia’s Victorian Alps, Jamison is taking 19 credits per semester in a curriculum inspired by her gap year.
“I had time to decompress and now I’m so excited to work. I came back so excited to start learning again,” Jamison said.
Gabriel Pincus (SFS ’14), who split his gap year between an Israel-based environmental studies program and a backpacking tour of Europe, said that a gap year was a way to break free of the life path students in the United States are expected to follow.
“America sets up this track that’s like a race. When you’re expected to stuff your résumé, go to college, go to law school and get your first job, when do you live anymore?” Pincus said.
Jake Sneeden (SFS ’12) devoted his time in between graduation and convocation to traveling in Australia and New Zealand.
“I knew I wanted to take a gap year my junior year in high school when I was reading Conrad’s ‘Heart of Darkness,’ and it sort of struck me that my experiences that I had had were not raw or powerful, but rather just repeating an old pattern, a worn path,” he wrote in an email.
Some who took gap years said their experiences have provided valuable insights that have enhanced their studies at Georgetown.
Zander Rounds (SFS ’14), who participated in an international development program in Ecuador, China, India and South Africa, said that his experiences have helped him contextualize what he is learning in the classroom.
“Let’s say I’m in [Map of the Modern World] and we’re talking about an issue in India. I’ve been there and seen it and worked with people and talked to people there. Having that context to draw on has enriched my academic experience,” Rounds said.
Pincus said that his year abroad sparked a new interest in sustainable international development, inspiring him to pursue the Science, Technology and International Affairs program at Georgetown.
“It’s very different from what I would have been doing, and I’m so glad for that,” he said.
Greg Miller (SFS ’14) spent a year in Blagoveshchensk, Russia, studying Russian at the local university. He said that his gap year instilled an intrepidness that has helped him to maximize his time at Georgetown.
“The most valuable thing I learned was to never say no, to always go out there and try new things. This has meant that at Georgetown I’ve taken advantage of so many opportunities and lived life to the fullest,” Miller said.
While students who took gap years were positive about their experiences, they highlighted several challenges and said that gap years may not be a good choice for every student. Pincus highlighted the obstacles of his living situation.
“Being a guest for months is a really hard thing. I had to be on my game all the time. It’s dangerous not to be,” Pincus said. “I think it’s true that gap years aren’t for everyone.”
Sneeden said that the wide array of challenges posed by different gap year experiences means anyone can select an experience that will keep him or her comfortable — but only those who want to make the most out of their gap years should take them, he said.
“I think gap years are for anyone who wants to do them, because there is so much variety to what you can do, but if you aren’t ambitious, plan poorly and just lose the year doing nothing, you’re obviously going to be miserable and not take anything away from it,” he said.
While students said the transition from their gap year to the freshman class at Georgetown went more smoothly than expected, they cited certain challenges.
Ivy Otradovec (COL ’14), who visited every continent but one during her gap year, found it difficult to adjust to the structured, regimented lifestyle at Georgetown after a year of freedom.
“I wasn’t used to having any routine or regime. If I loved it somewhere, I could chill there for a month. Suddenly I come here and there’s a random institution trying to enforce deadlines and routines and hours, right down to when the dining hall is open and closed. It seemed insane,” she said.
Pincus said that the contrast between the experiential learning of his gap year and day-to-day classroom life at Georgetown can prove
challenging.
“I get bouts of feeling that I’m not doing anything important here,” he said. “But there’s an absolute value in being in an academic setting, and I see classroom learning in a completely different way.”
Rounds said he was nervous about coming to Georgetown after a year spent without tests or exams, but the transition was smoother than expected because of the intensive nature of his gap year program.
“While I was traveling I had a pretty rigorous curriculum. I was reading as much as I am at Georgetown now, so I was prepared for the academics here,” he said.
Pincus expressed concern that gap years are presented as a less safe path than the traditional one, especially by high school guidance counselors, even if they yield positive results.
“What concerns me is that there are many more people who could manage taking a gap year and could benefit tremendously but don’t do it because guidance counselors in high school present it as a risk,” he said.
While Georgetown supported his decision to take a gap year, Pincus said universities should be more open in backing the option.
“Georgetown should recommend that incoming freshmen do gap years. It definitely doesn’t detract from the college experience at all. It actually adds to it so much,” Miller said.

Fashion designer Kenneth Cole announced a partnership with Compass Partners Inc. on Friday, stitching the two organizations together with a $500,000 pledge of financial support.
The deal was made public at the first annual gathering of the Compass Fellows, a group founded at Georgetown and now comprised of over 150 undergraduate students. The Fellows, who study at Georgetown, American University, The George Washington University, Indiana University and Tufts University, are aspiring entrepreneurs interested in business and social justice.
William Huster, brand manager of Compass Partners Inc., and Neil Shah (MSB ’10), co-founder of the fellowship, confirmed that Compass Partners will use Cole’s donation to extend its fellows program to between 12 and 15 schools next fall, including University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University and Fordham University.
The organization will branch out to Boston, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and allow students to regularly exchange ideas, meet and collaborate with other fellows.
Shah said that Compass’ first program, created at Georgetown in 2009, serves as a model for this growth.
“Our original 15 [Fellows] from Georgetown, we had such a close bond. We figured out entrepreneurship was more than just teaching someone about spreadsheets,” Shah said.
Cole said the new affiliation will allow Compass to expand and offer future business leaders more educational opportunities to interact with one another and assist the world around them.
“Together we will seek to identify, encourage and empower the next generation of change agents,” Cole said in a speech to the fellows at the Shift Series conference. “We hope to teach the skills necessary to navigate public, private, for profit [and] not-for-profit universes. The process will encourage the taking down of walls and the building of new state-of-the-art proverbial bridges.”
Huster said that Cole’s monetary contribution of $500,000 will be issued over a span of three years. He added that there is discussion about giving Cole a more active role in the project, possibly by offering him a spot on Compass’ board of directors.
Shah said that he and co-founder Arthur Woods (MSB ’10) first contacted Cole after hearing of his sponsorship of a similar civic engagement project at Columbia University.
When Cole expressed interest in the organization at a meeting in New York City, the two sides entered into six months of talks discussing how their partnership could further the message of social engagement.
Since launching Kenneth Cole Productions Inc. in 1982, the fashion mogul has successfully promoted a host of social issues. Internally, he founded the company’s community outreach initiative, encouraging employees to participate in service opportunities.
He also started the Kenneth Cole Foundation’s ‘Awearness’ program, in which consumers can contribute to causes such as AIDS awareness and tsunami relief efforts in Japan by purchasing items from a specialized line of products.
“Typically in the fashion business, we redefine ourselves every few weeks with new product offerings, but if the brand is more substantive it creates a strong, if not stronger, relationship with the customer,” he said in an interview with The Hoya.
“It makes the relationship itself bigger and more important. That’s something we’ve always sought to do.”
Angela Morabito (SFS ’12), a first-generation Compass Fellow who designed her own line of women’s accessories for her Fellows project, found Cole’s message inspiring and applicable.
“There are plenty of places where you can buy a piece of square fabric, like a scarf,” she said. “What a person wears should be an affirmation of meaning.”
Morabito’s company, Headlines: Smartwear for Smart Women, supports efforts to educate women by donating a portion of its profits to organizations that promote literacy worldwide.
Nick Maida (MSB ’13), one of these original participants, said that the organization’s connection with Cole will prove beneficial for social entrepreneurs on the Hilltop.
“If you look at where Compass was 18 months ago and then look at the growth and success it has enjoyed in such a short time, the sky is the limit. This partnership will assist in that continued expansion,” Maida said.
“As a fellow, this means better access to the resources and support group that makes the Compass fellowship such a success.”

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke called for an uptick in federal funding of high-priority scientific research in an address Monday morning.
His remarks, delivered to a packed Lohrfink Auditorium, kicked off a two-day conference titled, “New Building Blocks for Jobs and Economic Growth,” which was sponsored by the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the Athena Alliance, The Conference Board, the Kauffman Foundation and United States National Academies.
The conference addressed the government’s role in research and development and supporting American innovation.
“The tendency of the market to supply too little of certain types of research and development provides a rationale for government action,” Bernanke said.
His remarks set the tone for the conference’s panel discussions on topics like job creation, economic development and the future of American competitiveness.
Bernanke said that government support tools such as direct funding to research centers, grants to universities and individuals, contracts for specific studies and tax credits should be tailored to the projects they are supporting to obtain the best results.
Since the 1980s, the level of public spending on this type of research in the United States has fallen in comparison to the private sector’s efforts. More money has also flowed to applied research than to basic research.
Bernanke cautioned against neglecting the latter, as this results in an environment that lacks basic catalysts for change.
“The Internet revolution of the 1990s was based on scientific investments made in the 1970s and 1980s, and today’s widespread commercialization of biotechnology was based in part on key research findings developed in the 1950s,” he said. “Governments that choose to provide support for [research and development] are likely to get better results if that support is stable and long-term oriented, avoiding a pattern of ‘feast and famine.'”
According to Bernanke, the impressive impacts of innovation on economic growth and the many successes of government funding in research and development justify a call for increased spending in this area.
“Studies suggest that technological progress and the accumulation of intangible capital have together accounted for well over half of the increase in output per hour in the United States during the past several decades,” he said.
Bernanke also focused on the ever-increasing need for highly skilled, highly educated workers in today’s research-driven economy, advocating for greater government support for students pursuing science and engineering degrees.
The Fed chairman also addressed the effects of globalization on innovation.
According to Bernanke, the United States has been the global leader in innovation in research for much of the last century and, despite rising research and development spending by nations such as China and India, he sees American dominance in the field continuing.
At the same time, Bernanke emphasized the cooperative nature of research.
“In a globalized economy, product and process innovations in one country can lead to employment opportunities and improved goods and services around the world,” he said.

The recent $50 million reduction in the funding for International Education and Foreign Language Studies  has almost halved funding for some Georgetown language programs, forcing several heavy hitters on the Hilltop to speak out against the cuts.
For Georgetown’s National Resource Centers ─  the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, the Asian Studies program and the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies ─ there has been a 47 percent cut in funding across the board for 2012. Primarily operations and programming budgets have been slashed, but some initiatives have lost all funding for this coming school year.
The three centers grants for 2011 totaled $1.4 million, according to Vice President of Federal Relations Scott Fleming, and the centers’ directors say cutting this amount will be painful.
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Chairman of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board Chuck Hagel, both Georgetown professors, published an editorial in Friday’s USA Today denouncing the $50 million reduction by the Department of Education for fiscal year 2012. The pair argued that such funding slashes have ominous prospects for the nation’s ability to effectively conduct diplomacy, obtain intelligence and counter terrorism.
According to Albright, Hagel and the program directors, the funding cutbacks ultimately represent a threat to the future of the federal government and international relations.
“If you don’t have that money for training, you’ll have a group of students who don’t know the language and who don’t know the culture,” CERES director Angela Stent said. “Of course, that will have an effect on national security issues.”
Albright and Hagel are not the first Georgetown faculty members to stand in opposition to the cuts. University President John J. DeGioia penned a letter with Indiana University President MichaelMcRobbie to the House and Senate Appropriations Committee leadership asking the committee to restore funding to 2010 levels in the Fiscal Year 2012 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.
“Continuing these levels in Fiscal Year 2012 would seriously damage our nation’s world-class international education infrastructure, and thus weaken the expertise and knowledge important to our nation’s ability to meet economic, global and security challenges,” he wrote..
The July 12 letter was signed by 86 university and college leaders.
The Office of Federal Relations is working conjunctively with President DeGioia and universities across the country to restore the funding.
“We’re talking about an uphill climb if you will,” Fleming said. “While they’re talking about cutting, we’re talking about restoring.”
Georgetown was originally awarded the money as the winner of three four-year grants, which designated its three programs as National Resource Centers. These centers offer courses and experiences in foreign languages, cultures and politics.
All three centers are currently experiencing cutbacks in the number of courses offered, the amount of financial support available for graduate students, the number of academic events held, the availability of research grants and the extent of the Outreach program, which provides training to teachers in underprivileged areas of D.C. and Maryland. Funding for Fulbright-Hays training grants for graduate students has been cancelled nationally.
“The cuts were painful,” Fleming said. “We’re trying to minimize the damage.”
This year Foreign Language Area Studies fellowships, full scholarships for graduate students, have been purposefully maintained by the Department of Education despite other significant funding reductions.
“It’s quite possible that if nothing is restored, [the federal government] may be severely cutting back on that,” Stent said.
Beneficiaries of the money allocated to Georgetown’s National Resource Centers have gone on to work in military attaches, embassies, the National Security Council and the Departments of State and Defense.
“This is cutting muscle and it’s cutting tissue. This is not cutting fat,” said Victor Cha, director of the National Resource Center East Asia. Cha previously was a beneficiary of Title VI of the Higher Education Act through which the federal funding is allocated and is also a former director of Asian Affairs for the National Security Council.
The funding provided by Title VI has helped the each center developed a variety of seminars, lecture series and degrees. It has also notably expanded the university’s Arabic language program into the largest in the United States. CCAS Director Osama Ali-Mershed argued that the funding cuts are coming a time when Arab politics and economics are becoming of integral importance to the United States.
“The point of the matter… is that the government cutsin higher education are taking place at a moment when the democratic uprisings in the Arab world should be dictating the opposite trend,” he said.
In June, the directors of the three centers met with the Assistant Secretary of Education for Policy in order to reinforce the importance of the funding to the university.
“We’re doing everything we can to make [the Department of Education] understand what the cuts mean,” Stent said.

Focusing on peace and ending the culture of violence, Arun Gandhi — grandson of Mahatma Gandhi — led a dialogue with Georgetown and American University students to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.
“Peace has always been the foremost hope in my lifetime. I would like to inspire all of you to continue working for peace,” Gandhi said at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs.
For Gandhi, the image of two planes striking the World Trade Center marked a new and deeper level of violence in the world. But he stressed that the continuous War on Terror is not a solution.
“To avenge the deaths of some 3,000 people who died at the World Trade Center, we have sacrificed more than 7,000 of our young men and women,” Gandhi said. “It just doesn’t make sense to me.”
Gandhi developed his philosophy of peace while growing up in a volatile South Africa. Amid the oppressive system of apartheid, Gandhi was discriminated against by whites for being too black and by blacks for not being black enough. As a teenager, these formative childhood experiences traveled with a teenaged Gandhi to India, where for almost two years he was mentored by his grandfather.
“My grandfather used to tell us that every morning we should get up and make the resolution that, ‘Today I am going to be better than I was yesterday,'” he said.
In recalling his past, Gandhi also addressed the tension between Pakistan and his grandfather’s India. Gandhi related his firsthand experiences in the wake of the 2008 Mumbai bombing, conducted by a Pakistani terror group.
For Ghandi, the crux of the Indian-Pakistani relations, as well as the 9/11 attacks, rests in the divisiveness of religion.
“Humanity has learned enough from religion to hate, but not enough to love,” Gandhi said, quoting his grandfather on interfaith tension.
For Ghandi, religious practice, in its many forms, should lead one to truth and inner peace.
Gandhi stressed that the challenge to transcend issues of ethnicity and faith can be confronted on college campuses as well. He noted that the divisions within the student body can reflect the divisions of society at large.
“Why can’t we look at this as one human family and break down those prejudices and come together and learn from each other?” Gandhi said. “Education is not just what you read in textbooks and what the professors tell you in class. It’s what you learn from your own experiences.”
After taking part in the dialogue, students proceeded to the Washington Hebrew Congregation to participate in the seventh annual Unity Walk, a demonstration of plurality. The walk down Massachusetts Avenue stopped at a number of worship spaces and featured a Muslim call to prayer, meditation and the singing of “Amazing Grace,” as well as speeches from noted figures such as former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
On a day marked with memories of violence, students such as Julie Ogonis (SFS ’14), reflected on the last 10 years.
“To go from being a little girl in fourth grade to being an undergraduate … and having the chance to make some sort of impact and affect some sort of change, that is the most important part of the dialogueto me.”

Speaking to an overflowing crowd in Riggs Library Friday, Governor Mitch Daniels (R-Ind.) emphasized the importance of dealing with America’s debt crisis.
Before beginning, Daniels applauded those in attendance for their dedication to politics on a Friday night and for “not being nearly as nerdy as I thought you would be.”
Daniels, who graduated from Georgetown Law in 1979, said that the growing government deficit is the most important challenge facing the country today.
“Americans ought to set aside other differences until we have dealt with this single issue,” Daniels said.
The governor, who is credited with turning Indiana’s $600 million deficit into a billion-dollar surplus through a series of sometimes contentious measures, offered ideas for reducing the federal deficit, including the restructuring of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.
Daniels’ message struck a chord with audience member Taylor Colwell (SFS ’15).
“It was refreshing to hear from a politician who, while standing firm in his conservative values, is still extremely pragmatic and focuses on bringing people together, rather than dividing them,” he said.
After his remarks, Daniels opened the program to questions from the audience, which spilled into the President’s Room where audience members watched via television.
An advocate for smaller government, the governor addressed numerous questions regarding the role and size of government.
“Skepticism about big government is about as American as it comes, but don’t let skepticism about big government cause skepticism of all government,” Daniels said.
The event, which was hosted by the College Republicans, is part of a speaker series which is set to showcase Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) as well as conservative commentator Ann Coulter later this year.
College Republicans Chairman Joe Knowles (COL ’12) said he thinks that Friday’s event and the entire series are an integral part of Georgetown’s
political landscape.
“Students don’t just want to see these people on TV; they want to connect with them; they want to challenge them,” Knowles said.  “Students of Georgetown are very politically keen, so I love it when we invite speakers to campus because students can interact with them, hold them accountable and find out how the speaker’s thoughts impact their own beliefs.”

Nirupama Rao, the Indian Ambassador to the United States, expressed her hope that India can play a role as both a world superpower and a builder of the South Asian identity in her address Tuesday.
During the talk in Gaston Hall, sponsored by the Office of the President, Rao spoke to how the shared history and culture of South Asian nations can be the basis for future developmental partnerships, despite the region’s political fragmentation.
“South Asia is one concept, culturally and geographically, though not politically,” she said. “You can’t change the map.”
Rao echoed the rhetoric of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, noting that improved trade and investment networks combined with greater economic cooperation would further the growth of all South Asian nations.
According to Rao, reviving the South Asian identity must draw upon shared linguistic, historical and culture ties. While optimistic about the strength of these cultural linkages, Rao acknowledged regional instability as a key obstacle to integration and development.
“India is placed in a complex neighborhood,” she said. “Our relations with Pakistan are complicated by terrorism.”
Rao also touched on India’s relations with Afghanistan, the newest member of SAARC. Rao identified democratization and development as key goals necessary in order for Afghanistan to achieve stability and avoid returning to extremism.
“We have provided significant development aid to Afghanistan, at great human cost,” she said.
In addition to discussing India’s leading role in furthering regional development, Rao deemed India an international superpower, emphasizing the United States’ and India’s common foundation of democracy as a basis for their strengthened partnership in the 21st century. When she informed the audience that President Obama had personally told her that he looked forward to a reformed United Nations Security Council that includes India, she was met with thundering applause.
Rao also advocated for increased relations between Georgetown University and India. She referred to Georgetown as a leader in forging partnerships with institutes of higher education and learning after University President John J. DeGioia mentioned that the first US-India summit on higher education would take place at Gaston Hall in two weeks.
“The right to education has become a fundamental right in India,” Rao said.
Rao acknowledged the difficulty of making higher education more accessible for all levels of society, especially for girls and women — an issue that will be addressed at the upcoming summit.
“There is a saying in Sanskrit — wealth that education offers is the greatest wealth of all,” she said.
Rafi Khetab (SFS ’13), a native of Afghanistan, agreed with Rao’s emphasis on India’s role as a leader and possible model for other South Indian nations.
“India is a better example for establishing democracy for Afghanistan than European countries,” he said. “The countries of South Asia are connected by shared cultural ideas and deep historical ties. Afghans are better able to understand India’s form of democracy.”

A university partnership with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations will establish a new academic chair of Indian culture and society as part of an initiative to strengthen ties with the country.
The arrangement, which was announced in a talk by Indian Ambassador Nirupama Rao Tuesday night, will create a joint position between the School of Foreign Service and the College’s English department.
“The wealth that education offers is the greatest wealth of all,” Rao said in her talk.
According to Rob Mathis, a communications officer for the university, the initiative has been in the works since 2009. After taking shape during several meetings in New Delhi and at Georgetown, the final agreement will allow a visiting Indian scholar to teach and conduct research on the Hilltop for several years. Mathis said the university is still working out details of the search process, but expects to make a hire as early as next fall.
While the university has programs in Asian Studies and Contemporary Arab Studies, this is the first position specifically dedicated to South Asian studies.
Silky Kadakia (COL ’12), president of the South Asian Society, said that while she was aware that the university was considering such a position, the ambassador’s announcement came as unexpected. Along with other leaders of the SAS, Kadakia attended a dinner with University President John J. DeGioia and the ambassador, where she learned more about the position.
“It was a good surprise,” she said. “It’s a visible step toward what they’re trying to accomplish.”
While introducing Rao, DeGioia discussed the importance of building links between Georgetown and universities in India — a message he has been emphasizing for several years.
“Georgetown will continue to be a leader in forging partnerships with institutes of higher education and learning,” DeGioia said at the talk.
As part of the effort, the university will also hold a government-sponsored summit on U.S.-Indian higher education in two weeks.
Kadakia said that while Georgetown already has many course offerings in South Asian studies, she hopes that the new post and other initiatives will encourage a wider group of students to take these classes.
She also said that she hopes that the new chair will be able to keep up the momentum behind the expansion of Indian studies at Georgetown. For many members of the SAS, the absence of offerings in South Asian languages at Georgetown is one area they would like to see addressed.
“India and Pakistan are huge hot topics right now,” Kadakia said. “It makes sense to develop in this area.”

Holy Rood Cemetery has all the looks of a haunted graveyard. Perched at the crest of a hill and held above Wisconsin Avenue by a stone wall, the cemetery looks from the street like the setting of an Edgar Allen Poe thriller. It serves as a solemn gatekeeper to the neighborhood of Glover Park.
Inside, however, Holy Rood is a treasure trove of American history. Home to the remains of former slaves, Irish and German immigrants and at least one veteran of the Revolutionary War, the graveyard is also, strangely enough, the property of Georgetown University.
Carlton Fletcher knows Holy Rood inside and out. Fletcher, a 40-year resident of Glover Park, is the neighborhood’s unofficial historian. He has spent the last 15 years combing archives and indexes, and has compiled a thorough history of the entire neighborhood. Holy Rood, however, has been a focal point of his research.
Sitting on his front porch on a cool Wednesday morning, Fletcher explains why the graveyard piqued his interest.
“I started studying my neighborhood history in 1995, and almost immediately it became clear to me that the most historical, most venerable part of our area was the Holy Rood Cemetery,” he says. “It’s a fascinating place. It has lots to learn from it. It’s not very well understood by most people what it is.”
What it is, he explains, is an old parish cemetery, one that took in Catholics from all walks of life, charging the rich and burying the poor for free. It is a motley graveyard full of contradictions, with wealthy Washingtonians lying alongside black slaves. It is almost every aspect of Georgetown’s history clustered into one hilltop.
An Unwelcome Deed
Holy Rood Cemetery was founded in 1832 as the third parish graveyard for Holy Trinity Church. At the time, Holy Trinity fell under the watchful eye of the Jesuits at Georgetown College, so the school was listed as the rightful owner on the land deed. Parishioners were charged with the upkeep of the yard, but the university kept meticulous records of the burials that occurred there.
In 1942, Holy Trinity Church transferred into the new archdiocese of Washington, leaving its graveyard in the hands of the university. Georgetown protested, arguing that the Archdiocese should assume responsibility for the cemetery’s care, but the archbishop refused, suggesting that the land may be useful to the school in the future. The university ended up with a 100-year-old graveyard that it hadn’t wanted in the first place.
Eventually, university officials decided that there was a better use for the plot, and they began to investigate the possibility of exhuming the remains and developing the land. With views of the Capitol building, the National Cathedral and the Washington Monument, the old cemetery was a gold mine of real estate value, and if the university could find somewhere else for the bodies, it would be able to cash in on the true value of the land.
University officials contacted the archdiocese to discuss their options. Initially, it seemed that the archdiocese would agree to help exhume and rebury the bodies, but legal troubles eventually caused the deal to cave. Nevertheless, the university decided in 1984 that it would close the cemetery to burials as the first step toward development.
A public outcry followed. Several families still owned unused burial plots in the cemetery, and they took Georgetown to court, arguing that they still had a right to the land. In the end, they won, and the university was required to keep the cemetery open until the last contract had been fulfilled.
‘Skimping on Maintenance’
These days, the cemetery seems unthreatened, at least by university architects. The 1984 attempt to develop the land came as a public relations black eye to the university, and since then it has not introduced any new movements to remove the graves.
“There are currently no plans to develop the land,” Rachel Pugh, director for media relations, wrote in an email.
That does not mean, however, that the university has had a change of heart.
“Georgetown maintains Holy Rood cemetery,” Fletcher says, “But it does not do it with enthusiasm.”
In fact, in 2008, the university came under fire for its negligent care of the cemetery. An Aug. 28 article in The Washington Post drew attention to the poor state of the yard, blaming Georgetown for “skimping on maintenance.” According to the article, toppled tombstones and thick weeds frustrated neighbors, some of whom had relatives buried in the graveyard. Bill O’Keefe told the Post that he was saddened every time he went to visit his parents’ graves.
“I was simply appalled that a university like Georgetown didn’t care enough to do moderate or reasonable maintenance,” he told the Post. “It’s supposed to be holy ground … I just think it shows a disrespect for the dead.”
In response to The Washington Post article, the university cleaned up the graveyard to a certain extent, though a walk through the cemetery still reveals shattered headstones and marred monuments. Fletcher also points to a thick overgrowth that he says still covers several graves,
“It’s not really their fault,” Fletcher says of the maintenance crew that cares for the graveyard. “I think they give the guys a week to take care of it all, and no one is going to take hand shears and go around each individual grave,” he says.
The university contends that it invests plenty of resources into graveyard preservation.
“Georgetown performs routine maintenance at Holy Rood — including mowing the grass, removing decayed trees, repairing the fence and conducting spot security checks,” Pugh wrote in a different email. “These costs are covered out of our facilities operating budget.”
In response to charges that Georgetown has skimped on its monetary commitment, Pugh also recalled a major renovation that occurred about six years ago.
“A few years ago the University spent more than $1.5 million to repair the retaining wall adjacent to Wisconsin Ave,” she wrote.
Recently, there have been murmurs of a revitalization project sponsored by Holy Trinity Church. In a Sept. 20 article on Patch.com, writer Susan Bunnell noted that Holy Trinity Church has discussed the possibility with its parishioners.
“Holy Trinity Catholic Church has been asking its parishioners about the feasibility of negotiating with Georgetown University to have the cemetery returned and to begin improvements,” Bunnell wrote.
It is unclear whether the university is on board.
A Story of Heroes
Admittedly, the Holy Rood narrative can make Georgetown out to be the villain, but Fletcher takes care to debunk that view. In fact, he says, Georgetown’s emphasis on record keeping likely saved the cemetery’s history from fading away.
Parishes, he explains, are notorious for their failure to keep accurate records, and it is likely that Holy Trinity Parish would not have been as precise as the university archivists.
“If Holy Trinity and Holy Rood had not been under Georgetown, then records would not have been kept. If it wasn’t for Georgetown, none of this would have survived,” he says.
Fletcher says that he can also understand why the university may be frustrated with the land.
“The university has the property, and they can’t do anything useful with it. … Georgetown is not in the business of keeping graveyards.”
Still, walking between the tombstones, it is hard to imagine Holy Rood being dug up and replaced by a university complex, especially because it seems like Fletcher can point out something notable in almost every direction.
Take, for example, the gravesite of Joseph Nevitt. Located on the far fringes of the cemetery, Nevitt’s gravestone stands just two feet tall and bears only his name, dates and age. Fletcher, though, recognized the name as he was sifting through records of Revolutionary War pensions, and was able to identify Nevitt as a minuteman from Maryland. That two-foot gravestone is one of the last marks of a seasoned veteran of the Revolutionary War.
“He was the kind of man that as he walked through Georgetown, people pointed and said ‘That man was a Revolution hero,'” Fletcher says, standing by his tombstone.
About 50 yards away, Fletcher motions to the gravesite of Thomas Henry French, another war veteran, this time one who was present at the Battle of Little Bighorn. French ended up fighting just a few miles away from Custer’s Last Stand. Though he survived the brutal campaign against the Indians of the West, he succumbed to alcoholism just a few years later.
The tour could go on for hours, but Fletcher has to get back home.
Grounded in Contradictions
It sounds bizarre to call a cemetery an oasis, but for Glover Park neighbors, Holy Rood seems to be just that. One man sits on a crumbled gravesite and reads the New York Times. Another patrols the far fence, walking casually with his thoughts. Fletcher says that the homeless sometimes even set up camp in the middle of the cemetery. For a park designed to honor the dead, it seems strangely alive.
On the western side of the graveyard, a birdwatcher keeps a lookout for migratory species. He says that he used to enjoy the cemetery more when it was overgrown; back then, he could see more deer.
Nowadays, he says, the deer are mostly gone, but the does still return to give birth. It seems a contradiction — new life in the midst of all the death — but in Holy Rood, that contradiction seems to be right at home.

John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79) stepped modestly up to the podium a decade ago to address over 2,000 faculty, staff, students and alumni gathered there to honor him.
“Good afternoon, and thank you. It is a profound honor to accept this responsibility today as the 48th president of Georgetown University,” the newly inaugurated president said.
Ten years later, DeGioia has overseen the largest expansion of campus facilities in university history. From establishing auxiliary campuses both across the river in Virginia and halfway around the globe in the Middle East, to overseeing an over 50 percent growth in the university endowment and strengthening many of its academic disciplines from business to regional studies, DeGioia has left his mark on the past decade.
“President DeGioia’s leadership has built upon the foundations of excellence and strategic growth that his predecessors have laid down,” said Dan Porterfield (CAS ’83), a close friend to DeGioia and former senior vice president for strategic development.
LOOKING OUT FROM WITHIN
Much about DeGioia is unique in Georgetown history. He is the first lay president of a Jesuit university in America, breaking the line of 47 ordained predecessors. Consequently, he is the first to have a family of his own, with his wife, Theresa, and young son, J.T.
“He really was a major forerunner in showing the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities that a layperson could lead a Catholic institution with fidelity to its religious mission,” Porterfield said.
Despite the non-traditional choice by the board of directors, DeGioia gained the backing of the majority of the community almost immediately; his reputation as a deft administrator preceded him.
Porterfield recalled that there was unanimity among the Jesuits on the board of directors about the choice.
“Fr. Brian McDermont, S.J., said at the time, speaking for the Jesuits on the board of directors, that they believed Jack DeGioia was a ‘providential decision for the next president,'” Porterfield said.
Before his appointment, DeGioia had spent his entire professional life on the Hilltop. After receiving his diploma in 1979, he took a job as hall director in New South Hall. In 1982, he began work as an assistant to former University President Timothy S. Healy, S.J.
He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming dean of student affairs as a 28-year-old in 1985. He was appointed associate vice president and chief administrative officer for the main campus in 1992.
In 1998, former University President Leo J. O’Donovan, S.J. (CAS ’56), put him in charge of fixing the finances of Georgetown University Medical Center, giving DeGioia the title of senior vice president.
Three years later, when it came time for a search committee to choose the next president of the nation’s oldest Catholic university, its members settled on DeGioia. Leaders were impressed with his work negotiating a complex financial deal to sell the clinical operations of GUMC to MedStar while retaining the academic institution of the medical school.
DeGioia’s long tenure on the Hilltop also made him a logical fit for a leader.
“He came to the job with exquisite experience. … I think at the time of his election he knew more about Georgetown University than anyone but God,” Fr. Otto Hentz, S.J., said.
In-depth knowledge of his alma mater gave him the ability to manage and transform the institution effectively. But Special Assistant to the President for China Affairs Dennis McManus, S.J., commented that over 35 years at Georgetown has not boxed in DeGioia’s perspective. Hentz agreed.
“People wondered that since all his years had been at Georgetown, he might be narrowly focused, but the opposite is just the case,” Hentz said. “His vision is very broad.”
According to Hentz, one of DeGioia’s greatest strengths is his hiring of quality staff to manage the complex operations of the university.
“My impression is that he’s an effective administrator because he hires effective administrators. What amazes me is how much he is on top of all that’s going on at the university,” he said.
PRESERVING A JESUIT IDENTITY
Ten years later it seems that any question of DeGioia’s commitment to the university’s Jesuit and Catholic identity has all but disappeared. According to McManus, of all the achievements the president has made over his 10 years, one of the greatest has been the strengthening and rejuvenation of Georgetown’s Jesuit character.
Current Vice President of Mission and Ministry Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (COL ’88), agreed that DeGioia has carried on the founding principles of the university.
“He has been very intentional about promoting the Catholic and Jesuit character,” O’Brien said.
Hentz explained that, being Jesuits, many of DeGioia’s predecessors became complacent with the school’s identity.
“In the ’50s and even the ’60s, we sort of took it for granted. There’s no cruise control in these matters,” he said. “In some ways, his commitment to the Catholic, Jesuit identity of Georgetown is more impressive precisely because he is not a Jesuit.”
As the first lay president, DeGioia engaged actively in promoting the ideals of the order. He instituted seminars on Ignatian spirituality for senior administrators and the Board of Trustees to help teach the leaders of Georgetown what it meant to be a Catholic and Jesuit university.
In 2003, DeGioia instituted the Office of Mission and Ministry to augment his efforts to preserve the university’s spiritual heritage. He has consistently chosen a Jesuit to fill that role — the singular priest in the senior administration hierarchy.
Those close to DeGioia emphasized that he personally is deeply ingrained in the Catholic spirituality of the order. He has twice made the full 30-day journey of the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises, the backbone of Jesuit spirituality, according to O’Brien.
Out of his active pursuit of the university’s traditional heritage has come an enhanced commitment to interreligious dialogue. Under DeGioia, multiple conferences have drawn religious leaders from around the world to campus to discuss global faith interactions and understanding.
He also makes a trip to Rome every year to meet with the superior general of the Society of Jesus, the leader of the Jesuits, as well as leaders from the Vatican. Stemming from his conversations with Jesuit leaders have come some of his plans for Georgetown’s international engagement.
“Our education must be put in service to the world,” O’Brien said. “It is both our goal and our way of operating.”
LEADING AN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
The extension of the university into the global sphere has been one of the most significant developments of DeGioia’s term. Porterfield drew a connection between DeGioia’s work worldwide to former President Healy’s work nationally. Healy is credited with transforming Georgetown from a local institution to a national center of higher education. Porterfield said DeGioia engineered a similar change from a national to international university.
The past 10 years have seen an unprecedented increase in international engagement. Georgetown opened a branch of its School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar in 2005. It has made key investments in partnerships with both India and Israel, as well as in China, a process that culminated in a high-profile trip by the men’s basketball team to that country this summer.
McManus noted that DeGioia’s work in the international sphere presented a vastly different set of challenges from Healy’s national development.
“It’s a very different world. It’s a very diverse world,” McManus said. “When you try to go global you not only have the issue of languages, but you have discrepancies in levels of socioeconomic development.”
Porterfield postulated that the university still had a lot to discover about its international engagement.
“It’s not clear what will define institutions as global,” Porterfield said. “Out of a sheer force of conviction that it would empower Georgetown … for future generations to develop global relationships now … he was committed to building the relationship because he saw the long-term strategic value.”
“A different president might not have chosen to do that work,” Porterfield added.
GROWTH ON THE HOMEFRONT
Back on the main campus, DeGioia has overseen impressive growth on the Hilltop. With the building of the Southwest Quad, Rafik B. Hariri Building, Davis Performing Arts Center and the under-construction New Science Center, Georgetown will complete the largest expansion of campus facilities in university history.
Overall university property has also expanded significantly with the opening of the Qatar campus, the Clarendon location for the School of Continuing Studies and the groundbreaking for the Calcagnini Contemplative Center in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Porterfield said that the new space has drastically improved student life on campus.
“[The expansion of facilities] drastically enhances the university’s competitiveness,” he said.
Under DeGioia’s leadership, the U.S. News and World Report ranking has stayed fairly constant from 23 in 2001 to 22 in 2011, rising to 21 at its highest. He also worked extensively to shore up university finances in order to facilitate the university’s growth.
“Clearly his focus in stabilizing the financial platform of the university has been a priority,” said Erik Smulson, vice president for public affairs and senior adviser to the president. “It gave confidence to some of our alumni and donors that we would be a good manager of the funds that they were willing to give us.”
In 2004, the university created the Investment Office and appointed a the first chief investment officer to oversee the growth of Georgetown’s endowment.
Since DeGioia took office in 2001, the endowment has grown over 50 percent to top $1 billion. This remains modest with respect to peer institutions, but growth continues to offset operating costs and provide additional financial stability.
Under DeGioia, a $1 billion fundraising campaign was completed in 2003. At the end of this month, another $1.5 billion capital campaign, which has already hit its halfway mark, will enter its public phase.
Solidifying the financial base was necessary for one of DeGioia’s other main priorities to become possible: Meeting the full need of all applicants, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
“The first pillar of the [capital] campaign is scholarships,” Smulson said. “He recognizes that making institutions of higher education affordable for students from all economic backgrounds is a key priority.”
ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY
Amid the turmoil of the ongoing campus plan battle, DeGioia has experience on his side.
This is his second time as president encountering opposition from the surrounding community. He inherited a contentious situation with the 2000 Campus Plan, which was ultimately resolved in court in 2003. He also played a significant role in his position as a senior administrator during the 1990 Campus Plan proceedings.
The DeGioia administration has made a conscious effort to play a positive role in the District and its surrounding areas. “Our engagement in the city … has never been greater,” Smulson said.
According to Smulson, both the construction of the Southwest Quadrangle, which allowed more students to live in campus residences, and the Ward 7 initiative, which is a partnership between Georgetown and the Meyers Institute for College Prep, have been significant investments in improving neighborhood relations.
But for all his work at Georgetown and around the globe, many administrators emphasize a single point: DeGioia’s commitment to the undergraduate experience.
“His ability to translate to faculty and senior leaders why we value the development of undergraduates … has very significantly affected choices that senior leaders make in how to respond to student needs,” Porterfield said.
DeGioia has remained active in the academy, teaching an Ignatius Seminar for freshmen in the College. According to Smulson, who served as his chief of staff for four years, his class and weekly office hours are some of the most important events on his calendar.
However, some students feel that DeGioia could engage more on campus.
Brad Hilson (COL ’12) echoed that sentiment. “I never see him on campus. I’ve been here for three and a half years now and I never see him … I don’t think he’s a very student-oriented person.”
A JUGGLING ACT
For a university president, however, the job is much more than just community relations and fundraising campaigns. Those close to him say that the non-stop commitment takes its toll and that DeGioia doesn’t give an inch.
“There is no person in this university, not one, who would ever tell you that when they were working with President DeGioia, they worked harder than him,” Porterfield said. “He has been a servant-leader in the role of president in support of Georgetown University and its people.”

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton directly challenged the throng of students crowding the upper floor of Gaston Hall this morning to work toward improving the system of higher education in India.
“A democracy depends on education and an educated citizenry. At the highest levels of government, we are committed to this, but the success of these efforts will be determined by you, those outside government,” Clinton said.
Clinton’s speech kicked off the U.S.-India Higher Education Summit, aimed at brainstorming ways that U.S. and Indian citizens and officials can form strategic partnerships. In a day filled with roundtables and breakout sessions, other notable speakers included U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Robert Blake, Indian Ambassador to the U.S. Nirupama Rao, Indian Minister of Human Resource Development Kapil Sibaland various university presidents.
Speaking for about 10 minutes to a packed crowd of Indian and U.S. government officials, university faculty and staff and about 150 students, Clinton recounted her own college years.
“When I first started out at Wellesley, I wanted to win a Fulbright to India. Unfortunately, due to political reasons that program was suspended,” she said. “But now, [years later], I see higher education as an even greater passport to opportunity and understanding.”
While she began with a quip encouraging students to join the foreign service, she proceeded to emphasize how they can also make a tremendous impact through exchanges, internships and service projects.
“We want to see more students enrolling for credit at Indian institutions. I’m asking you to develop direct connections.”
Clinton’s keynote address set the tone for the summit, which is the result of collaboration between President Barack Obama and Indian President Manhoman Singh. She outlined the partnership between the two leaders, which has provided millions of dollars for development between the two countries. She added that the United States has more faculty exchange programs with India, the world’s largest democracy and one of the most rapidly growing economies, than any other country. She emphasized, however, that the burden of improving the quality of higher education in India will fall on the private sector.
“I’d like to challenge all of us to jumpstart these kinds of connections. There is no better way to do it than brainstorm in sessions this afternoon. How can our universities deepen collaboration, work on research and set goals we can work on meeting?” she asked. “What institutional barriers can we and should we break down?”
This partnership is the way of the future, according to Clinton.
“For those of you watching the great rise of India, I hope you are as excited as we are,” she said, before highlighting India’s plurality and potential. “We want these two great democracies to be as interconnected as possible.”

The Georgetown University Student Association is working with the Department of Public Safety and the Office of Facilities and Student Housing to implement the installation of GPS trackers in university transport vehicles.
While the initiative is in its early stages, GUSA is looking to partner with DoubleMap, a provider of GPS tracking technology. The objective is to place devices in all GUTS and Safe-Rides vehicles so that students can track the location of these services via a website or smartphone application.
“What is so attractive about this is that it helps to solve a lot of problems in one initiative,” GUSA Vice President Greg Laverriere (COL ’12) said.
DoubleMap has worked with transportation shuttles at Indiana University and Butler University in Indiana and has offered to implement the technology at Georgetown free of charge.
Laverriere added that GPS tracking would lessen the time DPS takes to inform students about SafeRides schedules and to dispatch vehicles while also serving as a way to increase student use of the free transportation.
“If I’m in a bar on M Street or in a movie theater, I could use the GPS system to figure out when to leave. … It decreases the number of students walking back late at night, decreasing noise,” Laverriere said.
The program is the latest in a series of GUSA transportation initiatives. Earlier this year, GUSA partnered with the university to add a third neighborhood shuttle on M Street from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., Thursday through Saturday nights. This Friday, GUSA will also reintroduce a program that allows GUSA members to drive SafeRides vans.
Though the plan was initially put in place by former GUSA President Calen Angert (MSB ’11) and Vice President Jason Kluger (MSB ’11) in 2009, various logistical and administrative hurdles have delayed the initiative’s implementation this semester.
The initiative will have one GUSA member drive one van per weekend, though GUSA is looking to expand the program with the ultimate goal of institutionalizing SafeRides as a fully student-run service.
A GUSA work-study program that would allow non-GUSA members to serve as student drivers is also in the works, though GUSA President Mike Meaney (SFS ’12) stressed that the particulars of the project are still being hammered out.
These initiatives would further a growing trend of upgrading Georgetown’s late-night transportation services in order to alleviate noise on weekends.
“The M Street shuttle is one of several initiatives the university is investing in to maintain the quality of life in the neighborhoods around campus,” university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr wrote in an email.
According to Kerr, the shuttle has seen 8,977 riders to date, averaging roughly 309 students per day.
Jake Sticka (COL ’13), the Georgetown student representative on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission, added that the M Street shuttle has been well received by the surrounding community.
Advisory Neighborhood Commission 2E Chair Ron Lewis was less certain about the effectiveness of the M Street shuttle in reducing noise and rowdiness in the neighborhood.
“I’m gathering data now from everyone in the community,” he said.

The Georgetown University Alumni Association announced that they will hold the second annual International Leaders Weekend Nov. 4th and 5th at Hotel Regina in Paris, France.
The conference, organized by the Georgetown University Alumni Association, allows alumni club leaders from around the world to network with Georgetown alumni internationally.
Founder and former President of the Alumni Club of France Sheherazade Semsar de Boisseson (SFS ’90, GRD ’90), offered to help organize the event.
According to Director of Alumni Relations Gail Griffith, the conference will be larger than last year’s weekend in London.
“This year we have a more robust network of international alumni, and we’ve been working with clubs to build up and provide resources,” Griffith said. “Alumni are traveling from places as far away as India and Hong Kong to participate.”
The conference will include both undergraduate and graduate school alumni from the classes of 1962 to 2010.
Throughout the year, alumni club leaders communicate through conference calls to discuss club practices, guidelines and setting up new clubs. However, this event provides the largest opportunity for alumni to interact in person.
The weekend will include panels about effective club leadership, current plans of the alumni association, roundtable discussions and receptions held by Semsar de Boisseson (F ’90, MSFS ’90) and the Mona Bismarck Foundation, which sponsors Franco-American art, science and education.
Planned speakers for the conference include R. Bartley Moore (SFS ’87) vice president for advancement, and Laura Wayland, senior director of alumni relations.
This year’s conference follows the launch of the Campaign for Georgetown, and events planned for the weekend include discussions of the initiative. Although alumni donations to the campaign will not be solicited at the conference, many attendees are already donors. Additionally, the international clubs have the ability to raise scholarship money.
Feedback from past conferences has been extremely enthusiastic according to Griffith..
“Alumni are amazed and delighted that Georgetown is finally coming to them,” she said. “It gives them a sense that they mean something to us, and that we consider their engagement significant.”

Derrik Sweeney (COL ’13) and the two other American students detained in Cairo Tuesday were released from police custody yesterday and have all left Egypt as of this morning.
Though an Egyptian judge ordered that the students, who are all studying abroad at the American University in Cairo, be released Thursday, delays in processing their paperwork initially suggested that the students would not be released until Sunday.
Speaking at around 5:30 p.m. Friday, Joy Sweeney, Derrik’s mother, said the students had been freed moments ago and were being escorted to the airport by Egyptian officials. Her son’s flight left at about 10:45 a.m. Saturday in Cairo, and he is expected to be reunited with his family in Missouri late Saturday night.
“I cannot wait,” Joy Sweeney said. “I couldn’t be happier.”
Sweeney also said she was able to speak with her son earlier Friday afternoon.
“He’s just so ecstatic to be on his way home,” she said.
Derrik Sweeney, along with Drexel University student Greg Porter and Indiana University student Luke Gates, was arrested Tuesday for allegedly participating in violent demonstrations in Cairo’s TahrirSquare. The three students were accused of throwing Molotov cocktails and clashing with police.
After a hearing Thursday, an Egyptian judge decided not to charge the students and instead to release them.
But after the students underwent medical exams Thursday required for their release, Egyptian officials determined there was not enough time left in the work day to file necessary paperwork. Friday and Saturday comprise the Egyptian weekend, so the Sweeney family thought that Sunday was the earliest Derrik would be released.
The students were held in a cell at the Kasr El Aini police station after the hearing, where officials fromAUC were able to visit them for the first time since their arrest.
Joy Sweeney said that many concerned about the three students contacted Egyptian officials, which expedited the release.
“Somebody was able to get ahold of somebody … that would work over hours,” she said.
At around 7:30 a.m. Friday morning, Sweeney was asked to book a flight out of the country for her son. The students are not being allowed to return to their AUC dorms to collect their belongings.
Sweeney, whose flight was the last of all the departing students’ flight, remained in the airport until his departure.
“His flight doesn’t leave until morning, but at least he’s spending the night out of police custody,” Nicole Sweeney, Derrik’s sister, wrote in an email Friday evening. “Basically, [the three students] are being deported.”
Sweeney’s mother said she wasn’t worried about his belongings or anything else and was just glad that her son was finally on his way home.
“Nothing else matters,” she said.

Georgetown student Derrik Sweeney (COL ’13) was among three students at the American University in Cairo arrested by Egyptian police Tuesday and accused of participating in violent demonstrations.
The three students have been moved to a prosecutor’s office in the southern part of the city, according to AUC’sDirector of Communications for North America, Morgan Roth. Legal proceedings are expected to move forward Wednesday morning.
The Washington Post reported that the students were accused of throwing Molotov cocktails and clashi
 
ng with police while protesting in Cairo’s Tahrir Square. A video aired on Egypt’s state-run television station showed the three students and their identification cards, including Sweeney’s GoCard.
According to university spokeswoman Stacy Kerr,
university officials have been in communication with Sweeney’s family and are also in contact with officials from the American University in Cairo, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. embassy.
“We were in disbelief at first, and now its like we’re trying to figure out what can
we do,” said Joy Sweeney, Derrik’smother.
She said she last spoke to her son around 3 p.m. yesterday and has not been able to contact him since he was detained. According to Sweeney, the State Department has not been able to speak with any of the arrested students either.
“It’s starting to all sink in and really hit home, the gravity of the situation, and I’m just going t
o continue to pray that everything is going to be okay,” she said, adding that it was difficult to watch the video of her son’s arrest.
“It’s pretty scary and pretty sad,” she said. “[Derrik] has a big-time deer-in-the-headlights look. It’s so atypical of him, because he always looks so confident.”
According to the Post, the other Americans arrested were Gregory Porter, a student at Drexel University, and Luke Gates, a student at Indiana University.
Roth said that the university was able to confirm that the students were initially being held in theAbdeen courthouse in Cairo. According to Roth, AUC sent a legal counselor to the courthouse to observe the questioning of the students before the proceedings were moved. The school has also contacted the U.S. embassy in Egypt.
“They have the best resources to be able to locate the students and monitor their whereabouts and their well being,” she said. “You want to be able to confirm with absolute clarity what’s happening and what needs to be done to secure [the students’] safety and their release.”
Stan Carignan, a junior at American University who is studying abroad at AUC, said he saw Sweeney and one of the other students at dinner before they left for Tahrir Square. Protesters have gathered there in recent days to show their opposition to the nation’s transitional government.
“I was shocked when I woke up this morning and heard that they were missing,” Carignan wrote in an email. “They’re all really great kids, so no one expected this to happen.”
The AUC has created an emergency news web page to update students about the events. The university also closed its Tahrir Square campus until further notice, according to an email sent to theAUC community.
“The university cabinet and the emergency management team are meeting daily to monitor the situation as it evolves,” the email said.
According to Carignan, the atmosphere at AUC is tense.
“We literally cannot stop talking about either this or the protests,” he wrote.
The Office of International Programs emailed students studying in Cairo and urged them to stay away from the events in Tahrir Square.
“Georgetown places great emphasis on maintaining the safety and security of all students studying abroad. We would like to remind you of the importance of refraining from participating in any political activities, including demonstrations, while you are studying in Egypt,” the email said.
According to Kerr, the university anticipates continued normal operation of fall semester programs in Egypt.
Gates reported frequently attending the protests on his Twitter account. In a tweet posted Nov. 19, Gates wrote that protesters had been fired upon with live bullets.
“Yes live bullets we have the shells, i was here!!” he wrote. He later posted, “It’s only scary cuz I feel so reckless.”
All three students were to return home at the end of the semester.
Joy Sweeney said she has been told by the State Department that the students are likely to appear in court tomorrow.
“We’re all in constant communication. We’re all talking back and forth and hoping to bring him home safe,” she said.

Derrik Sweeney (COL ’13) and the two other American students detained in Egypt Tuesday were questioned by authorities for over eight hours until about midnight Wednesday in Cairo.
The Sweeney family was able to speak with the detained student in a brief phone conversation earlier today. Speaking to his mother, Joy, Sweeney said he was at the protests but denied all other accusations made against him.
In a television interview with CNN just after 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, Joy Sweeney said she has received conflicting information about the next steps in her son’s case. Originally told that a resolution was unlikely to come before Tuesday, Sweeney said her husband heard within the last hour from the U.S. State Department that the students will face a hearing at 10:30 a.m. Thursday.
Nicole Sweeney, Derrik’s sister, also said a hearing is scheduled for Thursday. She said that she expects her brother to either be charged or released at that time.
According to Joy Sweeney, her son is being held in the same cell as the two other students with whom he was arrested, Greg Porter of Drexel University and Luke Gates of Indiana University.
The three students, who are all studying abroad at the American University in Cairo, were detained Tuesday for allegedly participating in violent protests in the city’s Tahrir Square, where security forces have contended for five days with protesters demanding the resignation of the country’s military leaders. The students have been accused of clashing with police and throwing Molotov cocktails.
According to AUC’s Director of Communications for North America, Morgan Roth, the three students were first interviewed around midnight Tuesday at the Abdeen courthouse, with an embassy lawyer present, before being moved to a prosecutor’s office in the southern part of the city. They were moved again Wednesday prior to undergoing a second round of questioning.
Though the AUC said it sent representatives to the courthouse Tuesday, it was initially unclear as to whether or not the students had actually been interviewed. Roth said she didn’t think it was unusual that the students would be questioned twice before charges were filed.
Noel Clay, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said that the embassy in Cairo was working closely with the three students and their families.
“We were able to visit the three detained U.S. citizens in Cairo,” he said, adding that he did not have further information about the proceedings.

According to family members, Derrik Sweeney (COL ’13) will not be freed until Sunday though an Egyptian judge ordered Thursday morning that Sweeney and two other American students be released.
After a two-hour hearing Thursday, the Sweeney family’s understanding was that the students would be released that day. The hearing, which came after the students were questioned Tuesday night and again for over eight hours Wednesday, was to determine if the students should be charged.
Derrik Sweeney, along with Drexel University student Greg Porter and Indiana University student Luke Gates, was arrested Tuesday for allegedly participating in violent demonstrations in the city’s Tahrir Square. The three students were accused of throwing Molotov cocktails and clashing with police.
At the hearing, the judge decided not to charge the students, and instead to release them.
But after the students underwent required medical exams, Egyptian officials determined there was not enough time left in the work day to file necessary release paperwork. Friday and Saturday comprise the Egyptian weekend, so the Sweeney family expects the students to be released Sunday, the next work day in Egypt.
According to a statement posted on the AUC’s emergency news webpage, the three students are being held in a cell at the Kasr El Aini police station. Families of all three students have arranged for the students to depart Egypt when their release paperwork is completed.
An email sent to the AUC community also stated that several representatives of AUC’s office of International Student Affairs visited the students Thursday, and will continue to do so until their release.
For family members, who expected Sweeney to be released Thursday, news of the delay came as a disappointment.
“Frustrating is just the half of it, but at least they haven’t been charged and they have been ordered released,” Nicole Sweeney, Derrik’s sister, wrote in an email. “They are in much better conditions at this point too.”
Responding to the initial news that her son would be released Thursday, Joy Sweeney, Derrik’s mother, was ecstatic.
“We’re down to the last leg of the journey,” she said. “Everybody is elated.”
In a statement, Mark Toner, acting spokesman for the U.S. Department of State, wrote earlier Thursday that the department was still working to independently confirm the release of the three students and had been in contact with their family members.
“We appreciate the ongoing expeditious consideration of this case by the Egyptian authorities,” he wrote.
In a statement released this morning after false reports of the students’ release, University President John J. DeGioia wrote that he was grateful for the news and thanked those who worked to secure the freedom of Sweeney and the other two students.
“Our thoughts and prayers have been with the Sweeney family and the family and friends of the other two American students,” he wrote. “As we give thanks, we continue to keep them in our prayers.”
Joy Sweeney explained what she plans to do when her son finally does return home.
“Giving him a big hug and saying ‘I love you,'” she said. “Those are my first two moves.”

ST. LOUIS, MO. — After landing in St. Louis Saturday night following his release from police custody in Cairo Friday,Derrik Sweeney (COL ’13) couldn’t stop smiling.
Sweeney, along with two other American students, was detained by Egyptian authorities Tuesday after being accused of participating in violent protests in TahrirSquare.
His late-night flight arrived to about 30 family members and friends, some waving homemade signs.
“You’re not going anywhere,” his father, Kevin, yelled as he and his wife wrapped their son in a bear hug.
“I’m never letting you go,” Sweeney’s mother, Joy, said while crying.
Speaking to reporters, Sweeney reiterated how thankful he was to be back in the United States.
“I thank my family and I thank the world, and I love the world and I thank the universe for being so beautiful and good,” he said.
Sweeney was detained Tuesday along with fellow American students Greg Porter, a student at Drexel University, and Luke Gates, a student at Indiana University. The three, who were all studying abroad at the American University in Cairo, were accused of throwing Molotov cocktails and clashing with police.
Sweeney denied the accusations, calling the reports inaccurate.
“We did not touch any, we did not prepare any or have any [Molotov cocktails]. … I don’t know what my friends, what these Egyptian kids were aiming, what they were intending to do that evening, but certainly I and the three of us Americans never held, prepared or threw any bombs or even rocks or did anything to harm anyone or anything.”
Describing the protest Monday night, Sweeney said he was enveloped in tear gas. Police were also firing what he thought were rubber bullets. At some point, Sweeney said that he was separated from Gates and Porter in the turmoil.
Upon finding each other, Sweeney said the students followed some Egyptians to what they were told was a safe place.
Instead, they found themselves detained in Cairo’s Abdeen courthouse.
“Well, the first night there we didn’t seem to get into the legal process, we were kind of outside the legal process,” Sweeney said. “We were taken away it seemed like. That night we were hit a bunch, I mean, I don’t think I have any lasting scars, fortunately.”
Sweeney said he spent the entire night fearing for his life.
“It was very, very frightening, especially that first evening that was probably the most scary, the most frightening thing of my life. They said they were going to shoot us soon. We spent nearly six hours that night in nearly fetal position sort of with our hands behind our back.”
The next day, the three students were moved to a public prosecutor’s office, where the U.S. Consul General in Cairo, Roberto Powers, was able to visit them. Sweeney was then able to speak with his mother briefly for the first time after being detained.
The students then spent time with a prosecutor as well as civil rights lawyers and volunteers, who assisted them in getting their case dismissed by a judge Thursday.
“I think that they didn’t have any sort of evidence connecting us to any crime, as that’s the case, and so they finally let us go,” Sweeney said.
For Sweeney, the help of the consulate and a legal team made all the difference.
“And I think it was greatly helpful to have the consul and the embassy out there so they couldn’t just do as they please with three kids,” he said. “Just having their presence, it was really helpful to know that Americans and other people were watching their actions.”
After he was released, Sweeney said he was able to view the video of the students aired on Egyptian state television.
“I was a little bit annoyed when I saw the first article because I noticed that I looked like the wimp of the three of us. But that was a very, very scary moment,” he said, adding that he fainted shortly after the video was filmed.
The clip was replayed on American news stations Monday morning, and when a cousin caught a glimpse of Sweeney’s face in the footage, it became the first notice his family received of his arrest.  After a nerve-wracking two days, the Sweeney family heard the news on Thanksgiving that the students would be freed.
“Best Thanksgiving news ever,” his cousin, Tiffany Sweeney, said.
Katie Dougherty, the cousin who first spotted Sweeney on the news, agreed.
“It made us all really thankful for everything we have and all of our family members,” she said.
But due to paperwork processing delays, the students were held in a cell in a police station Thursday night. Although it seemed then as though the students would not be released until Sunday, their paperwork was expedited, and all three were released Friday and escorted to the airport.
Sweeney’s mother never lost hope that her son would return.
“I knew he would come home,” she said.
Sweeney faced obstacles on the last leg of his journey, barely making his connecting flight from Washington, D.C., to St. Louis Lambert International Airport after being delayed in customs. His grandfather, Joe Wanner, said he haggled with the ConAir flight services in order to hold the plane for his grandson.
Wanner, who drove down from Chicago Saturday in order to see his grandson, emphasized how thankful he was that Sweeney had made it home.
“I didn’t understand why he went over there [with all the riots]. … This is not a party. They have a different mentality,” Wanner said. “There’s a difference between protestors and rioting. In a protest you stand up and hold signs. In a riot you throw rocks.”
Asked what he will take away from the ordeal, Sweeney was quick to reply with a smile.
“I learned to listen to the U.S. Embassy when there are warnings from the U.S. State Department. I learned there is a lot of fervor for the revolution out there and for change, and I learned it’s probably better to watch from TV,” he said with a laugh.
But he also said he hopes to eventually make it back to the embattled country.
“I still believe in general the Egyptian people are really good people and one day, inshallah, I hope to go back there, maybe. I don’t know,” he said. “Any time soon, no, I don’t think they ever want me to go back.”

Each semester, University President John J. DeGioia sets an hour aside to talk to representatives of the campus media. The highlights from today’s meeting include planned expansions to the university’s campus, how Georgetown is pursuing international engagement, howDeGioia hopes to the see the campus plan debate resolved and the future of the capital campaign. Read on to get a peek inside the several initiative’s on the president’s plate.
Downtown DC: The New Frontier
DeGioia announced that the university is working with a real estate agent to find more space for the School of Continuing Studies in D.C.
“Our code name is Georgetown Downtown,” he said.
The decision to expand was prompted by increasing demand for continuing studies and executive education programs.
“We’re looking for [space] in Downtown Washington, particularly for adult learners,” DeGioia said.
The university hopes to find an additional location near a Metro stop, according to DeGioia. This new area would complement the SCS’s satellite campus, home to the Center for Continuing and Professional Education and the Master’s Degree Programs in Technology Management and Journalism, Public Relations and Corporate Communications in Clarendon, Va. Moving more graduate student off of Georgetown’s main campus was one of the concessions made by the university in the debate with neighbors over the 2010 Campus Plan.
The university also plans to build the Intercollegiate Athletic Center adjacent to McDonough Gymnasium. The gymnasium was built when Georgetown was home to 3,000 men and eight sports, according to DeGioia. Today, the university has a population of 7,000 undergraduate students and has 29 athletic teams.
“McDonough just can’t hold intercollegiate athletics anymore, and we need some expansion,” DeGioiasaid.
A revised version of the original plans for the renovations is being submitted to the Old Georgetown Board for review. Earlier plans for the 125,000-square-foot athletic complex were given to the board, part of the U.S. Commission on Fine Arts, in October. The board, however, disliked aspects of the building, including its height, the proposed entrance and the planned glass wall and asked the university to make revisions.
The project will cost between $50 and 60 million, an amount which the university hopes to raise in full as a new focus for the ongoing capital campaign. DeGioia is hopeful about the initiative because the full costs of the Davis Performing Arts Center and the Hariri Building were fundraised.
“We’ve set a good precedent,” he said.
Around the Globe
The university is currently investigating become more involved in higher education in India. DeGioiaand his administration are exploring ways that Georgetown can engage and foster more higher education in partnerships with India’s 18 Jesuit colleges and 150 high schools. According to DeGioia, these schools are among the best in the nation.
“Part of the challenge for India is that they simply don’t have enough higher education infrastructure,” he said.
DeGioia hopes that both of the university’s global campuses can collaborate with institutions in India and create more opportunities for Indian teachers and students to better meet the overwhelming existing demand for college education and double the number of college attendants.
“We’re seeing a strong potential collaboration between our campus in Doha and opportunities in India,” he said.
DeGioia also remarked that the university is planning on undertaking initiatives in Brazil this year. Georgetown has been fostering a relationship with the country since the Council on Competitiveness: U.S.-Brazil Innovation Learning Laboratory was held on campus in 2008.
Capital Campaign Hits The Road
The public launch of the current capital campaign, “For Generations to Come: The Campaign for Georgetown,” and philanthropy throughout last semester propelled the university past the half-way mark of the initiative’s fundraising goal of $1.5 billion, according to DeGioia.
“We had an exceptional first six months of the year,” he said, further stating that he believed it was one of the university’s best fiscal periods to date.
The priority for the money continues to be funding scholarships, particularly through the 1789 Scholarship Imperative, an initiative to make Georgetown’s financial aid packages more competitive by offering 1,789 scholarships of $25,000 each year that are raised primarily by philanthropy.
The next step for the campaign is to hold smaller regional launches in eight to 10 cities internationally. Visiting the cities – which include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and London – will take about four and a half years, according to DeGioia, who plans to visit each of them himself.
DeGioia visited these same cities earlier in his time as university president to announce and fundraise for the 1789 Scholarship Imperative.
“That’s … a way of bringing everyone together in a really imperative way,” he said. “I know these cities and they know me.”
Controversy Despite Concessions
The university will be submitting its final filing regarding the 2010 Campus Plan to the D.C. Zoning Commission this Friday. A ruling on the revised plan from the commission will be given on Feb. 9 and accompanied by a written report in mid-April.
DeGioia hopes to avoid a lawsuit, which was required to resolve the controversy over the 2000 Campus Plan, and expects to the commission to be responsive to the concessions that the university has made.
“We have worked [as] collaboratively and responsibly as we possibly could,” he said. “We believe that the proposals we have made are … very responsible, very responsive.”

Robert Manuel, associate provost and dean of the School of Continuing Studies, will leave Georgetown at the semester’s end to begin his role as president of the University of Indianapolis.
Manuel came to Georgetown in 2006 after serving as assistant dean and clinical associate professor at New York University’s School of Continuing and Professional Studies.
Due to Manuel’s time as dean, the SCS has doubled its enrollment and is currently seeking a site in downtown D.C. to build a new home for its programs.
Manuel has also overseen major expansions to the SCS’s programs, including the development of Georgetown’s only part-time bachelor’s program and the introduction of six new master’s programs.
“He brought that vision to life in a comparatively short time,” associate dean of the School of Continuing Studies Vincent Kiernan said.
One of the programs developed under Manuel’s leadership, Georgetown’s Public Relations and Corporate Communications program, was recently deemed by PRWeek the best public relations program in the country for 2012. Although Denise Keyes, associate dean for the Master of Professional Studies in Public Relations and Corporate Communications, created the curriculum for the program, she said Manuel’s leadership was instrumental to the program’s success.
“His contribution and strength is bringing leaders like me from the industry and letting us do our own thing,” she said.
Kiernan emphasized that Manuel has created an atmosphere of collaboration within the administration of the SCS programs.
“One of his greatest skills is an ability to identify really, really sharp talent. … We all share in the vision,” Kiernan said. “It’s been a collaborative vision.”
Edwin Schmierer, associate dean of the Center for Continuing Professional Education, noted that Manuel has incorporated the university’s Jesuit ideals into its professional programs.
“He consistently tied our academic programs to the mission of the university and help[ed] our students become reflective lifelong learners.” Schmierer said. “He reimagined the educational mission of the Jesuits for modern day education.”
Manuel claimed that the integration of traditional values with contemporary outreach was his biggest challenge as dean.
“What weighed me down or woke me up every night was the possibility of failure of the imagination, not of any kind of practical failure,” he said.
Manuel said he was drawn to the private, Methodist University of Indianapolis, because it reflects the same opportunities he saw at Georgetown when he started.
“I saw at U. Indy all of those possibilities that I saw in Georgetown six years ago,” he said. “It was incredibly exciting to think that I could take what I love about Georgetown and use it in a leadership position [there].”
Keyes said she will be sad to see Manuel leave, but feels confident that the SCS will continue on its current trajectory, thanks to his direction.
“His vision was so big that there’s definitely room to grow,” she said.

Georgetown broke several records this admissions cycle, receiving an all-time high number of applications and recording an all-time low acceptance rate of 16.5 percent.
According to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon, this change is good news for the university.
“The new low acceptance rate indicates that Georgetown continues to be more popular for applicants,” Deacon said. “Sixteen percent … is extremely selective. We see no value in trying to drive that down into single digits, though we could. If we did, it would leave us in a much less personal place and candidates would face an even more numbers-driven admissions process, with decreasing attention to the personal stories of each applicant.”
According to Deacon, many colleges strive for ever-lower acceptance rates in an effort to be perceived as more selective.
“[The] size of the applicant pool and admit rate … [can be] manipulated by certain policies [that] many colleges employ to try to gain the advantage of perception,” he said. “We haven’t artificially inflated the numbers by … accepting the Common Application, the primary driver of multiple and frivolous applications.”
The admitted Class of 2016 is the most diverse class in Georgetown’s history. According to Deacon, of 3,316 accepted applicants, 33.5 percent are minority students, up from 31.4 percent last year.
The admitted Class of 2016 is 15 percent Asian, 10 percent black, 8 percent Hispanic and less than 1 percent American Indian. Fifty-three percent of the admitted pool self-identified as white, 8 percent as foreign nationals and 6 percent did not specify an ethnic background.
According to Vice President of Institutional Diversity and Equity Rosemary Kilkenny, the diversity of Georgetown’s pool of admitted students is increasing, yet there is a disparity between the number of minority students who are admitted and who actually enroll.
Though Asian-Americans, blacks, Hispanics and American Indians represent about 30 percent of admitted students, they make up about 22 percent of Georgetown’s student body.
“We would certainly like the yield of minority students to be higher … [though] it is improving,” Kilkenny wrote in an email.
Yield rates, or the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university, have long been lower among minorities.
While the yield among black students has historically been about 30 percent, lower than the overall yield among accepted students of 46 percent, last year the figure rose to 40 percent.
“In my judgment, increasing the yield is a challenge, not a problem, and it is a challenge that we are tackling in a very big way,” Kilkenny said.
Geographically, at least one student was admitted from each of the 50 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, according to Deacon.
New York, home to 384 admitted students, is the state with the most acceptances. It is followed by California with 363 acceptances, New Jersey with 276, Massachusetts with 189 and Maryland with 187.

Four months ago, Derrik Sweeney (COL ’13) landed in St. Louis, Mo., marking the end of a four-day-long ordeal that began when he was arrested by Egyptian police for protesting in Cairo’s Tahrir Square.
As his first semester back at Georgetown concludes, Sweeney said the end of the term is shaping up to be very different from his final few days in Cairo.
“It’s been pretty peaceful,” he said, laughing.
In November, Sweeney and two other American students studying at The American University in Cairo were arrested for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails and clashing with police during violent demonstrations in Tahrir Square. The three students, arrested early on the morning of Tuesday, Nov. 22, were initially held in Cairo’s Abdeen courthouse.
When news of the arrest of Sweeney and fellow students Greg Porter from Drexel University and Luke Gates from Indiana University first broke, the story made headlines across the nation. For Sweeney’s friends and family, it was a harrowing experience.
Paulina Sosa (COL ’13), who also studied abroad at AUC last fall, said she saw Sweeney the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 21, just before he joined the protests. Sosa thought the media must have reported the wrong name when she first heard about the incident.
“The situation still seems surreal,” she wrote in an email shortly after the arrests.
Sweeney described his first night in custody as the most terrifying experience of his life.
“It was very, very frightening,” he said after landing in St. Louis, Mo. “They said they were going to shoot us soon. We spent nearly six hours that night in nearly fetal position, sort of, with our hands behind our backs.”
The next day, Sweeney, Porter and Gates were moved to a public prosecutor’s office, where U.S. General Consul of Cairo Roberto Powers was able to meet with them and arrange for legal help.
After a hearing Thursday, Nov. 24, an Egyptian judge decided not to charge the three students and ordered that they be released, giving Sweeney’s family what they described as an incredible Thanksgiving gift. The three students were released and escorted to the airport Friday, Nov. 25, returning to the United States on separate flights.
“I cannot wait,” Sweeney’s mother, Joy, told The Hoya when she first heard that her son had been released. “I couldn’t be happier.”
When he landed in St. Louis, Sweeney was met at the airport by about 30 friends and family members cheering and holding signs. He appeared on The Today Show and was interviewed about his experiences by media organizations across the nation in the days following his return.
But University President John J. DeGioia said Sweeney’s participation in the protests was unacceptable when he spoke to campus media at the beginning of the spring semester.
“There are very clear instructions for our students studying abroad as to what’s permissible behavior for guests in the country at the time,” he said. “Our Office of International Programs performed in a heroic way during that weekend, because it was a very, very tough period.”
When Egypt’s revolution began in January 2011, the university evacuated all 15 students who had been studying abroad there. The program was reinstated in the fall despite continued unrest in the country.
Though parliamentary elections took place earlier this year, discontent remains with the ruling junta, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. According to Amnesty International, the council has committed human rights abuses — from trying civilians in military courts to killing protesters — comparable to the brutality seen during President Hosni Mubarak’s rule.
For Sweeney, however, his ordeal in Cairo has swiftly become a memory.
Though the university did not accept any transfer credits from his semester in Cairo, he said there have been few lasting repercussions from his detainment in Egypt.
“In the grand scheme of things, it’s not really a big deal,” he said.
Sweeney added that his experiences in Cairo have continued to shape his life philosophy. He is taking a class on government and ethics this semester and sees many connections between the class and the revolution in Egypt.
“I guess I feel like I have some personal experience,” he said. “I’ve felt a stronger resolve.”
He is also still in touch with friends from his semester at AUC. Sweeney said he visited Porter, who he said is doing well, in February.
After his homecoming in November, Sweeney told The Hoya that he was still determined to return to the Middle East. A semester later, he maintains that he wants to go back someday.
“It’s a beautiful place. I’m not sure if I’m legally allowed to go back to Egypt, though,” he said, laughing once more.

One year after a magnitude-5.8 earthquake shook the District last August, causing substantial damage to the Washington National Cathedral, the church has received a $5 million donation for repairs from the Indianapolis-based Lilly Endowment, a private philanthropic foundation that supports community development, religion and education.
The donation covers a quarter of the estimated $20 million in damage to the cathedral, a sum that officials say will facilitate the first substantial repair to the cathedral’s limestone edifice.
“The Lilly Endowment’s generous gift of $5 million … really is transformative in our ability to officially begin the restoration phase, which started with laying the first repaired stone in the tower a couple of weeks ago,” Richard Weinberg, director of communications for the cathedral, said.
Though millions of dollars have already been spent on repairs caused by the earthquake, most of the funds have been funneled toward strengthening the building’s structure.
“Over the first year, we were doing stabilization work. We were removing damaged stonework from the building and were able to safely reopen after being closed for 10 weeks after the earthquake,” Weinberg said. “Future work is really dependent on funding.”
Weinberg added that the prioritization of future repairs will be determined by a volunteer task force, which is due to produce a report in October.
“We have a host of experts that are volunteering their time in the fields of construction, engineering [and] architecture. … As we go about restoring the cathedral, we have to consider how to best steward the funds,” Weinberg said.
The Washington Monument, the other main D.C. landmark to be damaged by the earthquake, has also benefited from major philanthropic gifts. According to the National Park Service, which runs the monument’s website, philanthropist David Rubenstein made a $7.5 million donation in mid-January. Combined with funds from Congress, Rubenstein’s grant is sufficient to complete the full repairs to the monument.

Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, released a statement to the media Saturday criticizing Georgetown’s representation of the Hindu faith in its theology courses.
Zed said that a spring 2012 Georgetown course on Hinduism, “Hinduism Today,” made use of dacoitfilm, a genre that depicts bandits in rural India. He argued that the course should instead focus on the more religious aspects of Hindu culture.
“GU should treat the … third largest religion of the world more respectfully and depict it more honestly,” he said in the statement.
The film in question, “Bandit Queen,” tells the nonfictional story of a child bride who escapes from her much older husband to live as a criminal but eventually becomes a member of the Indian parliament.
Ariel Glucklich, the theology professor who taught the course last spring, defended his decision to show the film in class.
“It’s not dacoit. It’s not an exploitative commercial movie,” he said. “I would wager any amount of money [Zed] never saw the movie.”
Zed’s statement listed many alternative media sources and texts that he thought would be more appropriate to a Hinduism course. In response, Glucklich explained that “Hinduism Today” was intended to focus on modern representations of Hinduism as well as current cultural practices. He said that in his other courses, which focus on the history of traditional Hinduism, he teaches many of Zed’s suggested texts.
“This critique came from someone trying to defend a point of view, not thinking about students’ education,” Glucklich said. “He’s thinking of defending a privileged point of view, and that’s not my job at Georgetown.”
Theology courses that explore Hinduism attract Hindu and non-Hindu students alike, and some agreed with Zed’s criticisms.
“I was worried for the people who didn’t have a background in Hinduism,” Hindu Students Association President Anwesha Banjeree (COL ’13) said. “I remember sitting in class, wondering what everyone else was thinking about us.”
Banjeree, who took Gluckich’s class “Hindu Religious Tradition,” said she thought she interpreted the lectures differently from her non-Hindu classmates.
“To me it was like a history class, but to other people it was a Hinduism class,” she said. “I liked it, but it still concerned me to some extent.”
Smiti Mohan (MSB ’15), who serves as HSA’s treasurer, took the course in question, Glucklich’s“Hinduism Today,” in the spring of 2012.
“I would speak up if [the professor] asked if any practicing Hindus had anything to say,” she said.
Some of Georgetown’s introductory theology classes also touch on Hinduism.
HSA Vice President Neha Jejurikar (NHS ’13), who is currently enrolled in “The Church in the 21stCentury,” taught by Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (CAS ’88), said she has enjoyed her theology courses.
“Although our focus is on Christianity today, [O’Brien] is very proactive about including the Hindu faith in discussion in the classroom,” Jejurikar wrote in an email. “I am thankful that he makes a conscious effort to relate the issues we talk about in class to every student’s faith tradition.”
But Banjeree, Mohan and Glucklich agreed that they want to see more resources for Hindu students at Georgetown.
“Hinduism is so vast and diverse, so having classes that focus on smaller aspects of the religion could be cool,” Mohan said. “Maybe a class about holidays or a class exploring different incarnations of the gods. The [current] classes are so broad and try to cover so much.”
Glucklich also expressed interest in reintroducing classes that focus on teaching the Hindi language.
“We had a Hindi teacher for two years, but she’s gone,” he said. “Sanskrit is taught by a professor in the linguistics department, so the approach is not to read scripture but from a linguistic perspective.”
Banjeree expressed gratitude to Georgetown’s Campus Ministry staff for their support of HSA.
“They have been very supportive [of] HSA and HSA’s growth over the past few years,” Banjeree said. “I think they’re very open minded to our future and the Hindu community on campus. We would not be half of what we are without their support.”

With a record 61 graduates from the Class of 2012 flocking to join Teach For America, Georgetown produced the third-highest number of new recruits from among medium-sized universities this year.
This is the third time in four years that Georgetown has placed third among medium-sized universities, which the organization defines as those with between 3,000 and 9,999 undergraduates.
According to Mike Schaub, executive director of the Cawley Career Education Center at Georgetown, Teach For America is an attractive option for many graduates because it combines community service with opportunities for skill development for later careers.
“Many Georgetown students are dedicated to volunteering and service activities, and they want to find a way to continue serving others after graduation,” Schaub said. “Teach For America is one organization in which graduates can help others while obtaining valuable skills and experiences that will be beneficial to their careers.”
More than 470 Georgetown graduates have volunteered for the organization for two-year terms after graduation, and the number has grown each year, despite an increasingly competitive applicant pool. Only about 12 percent of the 48,000 applicants for the 2012 teaching cycle were hired, hailing from over 600 colleges across the country.
Deven Comen (COL ’12) joined the program after graduating last May and started teaching ninth-grade English at Anacostia Senior High School in southeast Washington, D.C., earlier this month. Comencharacterized the experience as a natural progression from her undergraduate studies.
“Joining Teach For America was kind of like the culmination of … my time at Georgetown, [which was] deeply influenced by Jesuit values of social justice,” Comen said. “Going to school at Georgetown, [I was] surrounded by people so committed to their passions and to helping others.”
Comen, who developed an interest in education throughout her college years teaching abroad in India and Thailand, as well as in D.C. schools through One World Youth Project, added that the experience affords a unique opportunity for leadership not found in most post-graduation pursuits.
“Right out of college, I’m leading a group of students. … All the flexibility I have in determining what I teach and how to teach is different from any other post-graduate career,” she said. “While my friends are in cubicles doing busy work, I feel like I’m really making a difference.”

Though Rangila is not until mid-November, practices are already underway for one of Georgetown’s largest student-run events.
The annual two-night performance, which showcases traditional South Asian dance along with other styles, is now in its third week of rehearsals. This year, over 600 dancers and 30 choreographers are involved in the show.
While dancers are still in the process of learning basic choreography, co-coordinators Neha Sobti (COL ’13) and Rohan Muralidhar (SFS ’13) have been planning this year’s Rangila since the summer. Major logistics, such as costume selection, have been nailed down with the help of the Georgetown University South Asian Society’s executive board, and the coordinators’ focus has shifted to the choreographers’ job of teaching their routines to hundreds of mostly inexperienced dancers.
“We call them the backbone because it’s their enthusiasm and creativity that really make a great show,” Sobti said about the choreographers, who were all appointed last spring.
In addition to South Asian culture, Rangila incorporates other dance styles, including salsa and contemporary hip-hop. This year the performance will feature a number from hip-hop group Groove Theory. Other dance groups on campus, including GU Irish Dancers and GU Dance Company, will also perform independently during the show.
Although organizing Rangila is extensive, coordinators say the benefits of the event far outweigh the work.
“It’s just a blend of great things,” Sobti said. “It’s [fundraising], getting to meet people, dancing and at the same time [showcasing] South Asian culture that a lot of people wouldn’t be exposed to.”
Rangila, which is now in its 17th year, has always been committed to donating all of its proceeds to charitable causes. In recent years, ticket sale revenues have been given to The Asha Kendra Hope Center, a non-profit career counseling, vocational training and educational resource center located in Jaipur, India. AKHC is exclusively funded by the GUSAS.
Rangila has also been a way for students with diverse interests to meet and work together.
“Rangila is unique because it is the one event that unifies all the kids on campus,” choreographer Sana Imam (COL ’15) said. “Every school, every race comes together for this event.”
Sonia Vora (SFS ’15), another choreographer, agreed with Imam.
“It’s one of the few things that people genuinely do just for fun. I think we have a lot of clubs that are good resume-builders, but Rangila … people just do it because it’s cool,” Vora said.
For Katelyn McNelis (SFS ’15), a Rangila rookie, last year’s performance left a lasting impression that motivated her to get involved.
“When I went last year, everyone radiated happiness,” she said.

It’s been said that the states are 50 political laboratories, and indeed, some of the most important policymaking
in the country occurs at the state level. But with the attention of the media and the public fixed on the presidential contest and the battle for control of Capitol Hill, the 11 gubernatorial races taking place on Nov. 6 have been largely overlooked. That’s just wrong — these races have the potential to significantly alter politics and policy for the coming years. Ri
ght now, the 11 contests can be broken down into three broad tiers of competitiveness.
I’ll call the four non-competitive races Tier Three. In these cases, the incumbent governor will be reelected handily: Gov. Gary Herbert (R-Utah), Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R-N.D.), Gov. Jack Markell (D-Dela.) and Gov. Peter Shu
mlin (D-Ver.) all benefit from the significant partisan leans of their respective states, and are shoo-ins for another term in office.
 
The only remotely interesting campaign of these is actually occurring in Vermont, a state whose strong Democratic lean at the national level is often deceptive: it has a long history of liberal Yankee Republicans, such as former Gov. Jim Douglas and former Sen. Jim Jeffords. In fact, Shumlin was elected over Republican Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie by a margin of less than 2 percent in 2010 (in Vermont and New Hampshire, a gubernatorial term is two years). Vermont Republicans have a compelling candidate in State Senator Randy Brock, a former State Auditor who is black and in the Rockefeller Republican tradition. If any of these races is to be an upset, look for Brock to pull off a major surprise
in notoriously unpredictable Vermont. I wouldn’t put money on it, though.
 
Tier Two includes races that are much more competitive. In West Virginia, voters face a rematch from the 2011 special election after former Gov. Joe Manchin was elected to the U.S. Senate. Democrat Earl Ray Tomblin, the acting governor and president of the state senate, defeated Republican businessman Bill Maloney by less than 3 percent. Tomblin is now seeking a full four-year term, and should probably win again over Maloney. But Maloney is running a well-funded campaign that muscularly links Tomblin to the highly unpopular President Obama, particularly on regulation of the sacrosanct coal industry. The outcome of this race will show whether West Virginians, traditionally Democratic at the state level, are finally beginning to gravitate to the GOP at all levels.
 
On the other side of Appalachia, Missourians are likely to reelect Gov. Jay Nixon, a moderate Democrat. Nixon is a popular incumbent facing a challenge from St. Louis businessman Dave Spence. After state Republicans pressured Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder (R-Missouri), who had openly frequented strip clubs and tussled with e
mployees, to leave the race, Spence seized the GOP mantle. He has left much to be desired, running a gaffe-riddled negative campaign. While he could knock off Nixon, I am skeptical, and believe Missourians would be wise to reelect their governor.
 
Finally, Indiana features a fascinating contest to succeed the term-limited and hugely popular Gov. Mitch Daniels (R-Ind.). Congressman Mike Pence (R-Ind.) is primed to keep the governor’s mansion in GOP hands. He has been running a smart, polished campaign that has simply dominated his Democratic opponent, former State House Speaker John Gregg (D-Ind.). Gregg is an affable candidate whose campaign logo is his iconic bushy mustache, and, as a relatively c
onservative Democrat, he certainly is a credible contender. But the combination of a Romney romp in Indiana and Democratic energy focusing on the tossup senate race, Gregg faces a steep climb.
 
Tier One is where things really start to get thrilling. Four states have contests that will go down to the wire. Republican Pat McCrory (R-N.C.), the popular former mayor of Charlotte, increasingly looks like North Carolina’s next governor. After losing by the skin of his teeth to incumbent Gov. Bev Perdue (D-N.C.) in the Democratic tidal wave of 2008, McCrory looks like he can capture the governor’s mansion with his pro-business, pragmatic policy prescriptions. Facing tremendous unpopularity over her weak tenure in office, Perdue opted to retire rather than run for reelection, ceding the Democratic nomination to Lieutenant Governor Walter Dalton (D-N.C.). Dalton is likable and folksy, and the type of moderate Democrat who traditionally wins in North Carolina. Yet his ties to Perdue have hindered his campaign. If Obama runs well in North Carolina, he could put Dalton over the top. Otherwise, it’s McCrory’s race to lose.
 
Another swing state, New Hampshire, is also choosing a new governor. This time voters are pick
ing a successor to the very popular Gov. John Lynch (D-N.H.). Frankly, neither candidate is wildly impressive. Democrat Maggie Hassan, former majority leader of the state senate, is a textbook Democrat. Her campaign commercials are uninspired, and she is not a particularly strong speaker. Her Republican opponent is Ovide Lamontagne, whose political experience includes failed bids for governor in 1996 and the U.S. Senate in 2010. Lamontagne is smart and likeable, and his campaign has raised significant cash. Yet as a staunch social conservative, Lamontagne is generally too conservative for the majority of New Hampshirites. The two have been deadlocked in the polls, and I honestly can’t predict who will win the day.
 
The election in Montana is tight, as well. Gov. Brian Schweitzer (D-Mont.) is stepping aside due to term limits, but has expressed serious interest in running for president in 2016. Keep an eye on him. His party benefits from a strong candidate for his replacement in Attorney General Steve Bullock. Bullock is young, telegenic, a tough prosecutor and loyal to Montana values on guns and land issues. Republicans nominated a relatively underwhelming former congressman, Rick Hill (R-Mont.). Hill benefits from the overall conservative lean of the state, but Bullock is a better candidate with a superior campaign. Either could become the state’s next governor.
My favorite gubernatorial race this time around is in Washington state, where voters will replace retiring Gov. Christine Gregoire (D-Wash.). In a state that has not elected a Republican governor since 1980, this looks to be the GOP’s best shot yet. Republican Attorney General Rob McKenna (R-Wash.) is wonky, personable, effective and moderate. While Washingtonians strongly supported Obama in 2008, they gave an even larger reelection victory to McKenna, who consistently has proven his ability to attract Democratic support. Democrats nominated former Rep. Jay Inslee (D-Wash.), who frankly is not a flickering flame of intellect. Inslee is a generic liberal Democrat, who won a small victory over McKenna in the nonpartisan blanket primary held in August. The two now advance to the general election with Inslee holding a miniscule lead in the polls. If McKenna can tap into voters’ desires for independent-minded change —especially in the vote-rich Seattle area — he will eke out a win, and Washingtonians will be better for it.
States that are big and small, red, blue and purple will elect governors in two weeks. The decisions voters make in these races, particularly compared to how they behave in elections for president and Congress, will reveal a great deal about the political character of our country. On Election Night, you’ll have your work cut out for you: the returns from these 11 races are not to be ignored.

Rangila may be one of the most popular events on campus — more than 500 students will take part in this year’s show — but very few understand the cultural significance and history of the dances performed.
To those unfamiliar with the event, Rangila might seem like any other entertainment show held in Gaston Hall. Rangila, a Hindi word that roughly translates to “colorful,” consists of 11 dances and various independent acts that draw from the diverse South Asian culture. The 11 dances aren’t just meant to entertain audiences; each comes from a distinct cultural tradition in different parts of South Asia.
Six of those 11 dances stay true to major dance traditions from the Indian subcontinent. The first dance of the show is always Raas, the traditional folk dance form of Vrindavan, a town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Characterized by the use of dandiya, decorated sticks that dancers click against their partners’, Raas is a flurry of coordinated movements — almost like intricate line dancing, and rhythms build to mirror the fast-paced music.
A featured folk dance that hails from Gujarat, a state in western India, is Garba.
“[Garba] involves a lot of circular movements, hand clapping and formation work,” co-coordinatorNeha Sobti (COL ’13) said. Dancers also typically wear full skirts that dramatically billow and twist around the dancers’ ankles as they spin and rapidly switch directions.
Another traditional number, Folk Dance, comes from Rajasthan. “They use a lot of props and formation work as well. This year, the props are manjira … that are like cymbals for your hands that the girls are going to use,” Sobti said.
Many of these regional dances were part of the celebrations in historical festivals throughout rural India that have maintained their style in modern times. They are as ubiquitous as they were centuries ago, a testament to the vitality and strength of tradition in South Asia.
Not all of the dances are as obscure, however. Bhangra is a well-known form of dance based in the traditional folk celebrations of the Punjab region in north India, which borders Pakistan.
“Bhangra is very energetic, with a lot of jumping and hopping — big moves,” co-coordinator RohanMuralidhar (SFS ’13) said. “There’s Bulldog Bhangra, which is pretty evenly boys and girls and more underclassmen. Senior Bhangra is huge, with about 160 seniors and lasting almost 10 minutes. It’s kind of the culminating event of years of participating and part of the whole senior experience.”
Kathak, a dance also from Uttar Pradesh, has more of a classical influence, with its roots in ancient Indian professional, nomadic storytellers of mythological epics. A very technique-heavy dance, Kathakis not as easy to pick up as many of the other ones in the show, which are primarily folk dances meant for mass participation in villages throughout South Asia during seasonal festivals. It was influenced by temple and ritual dances and later by the Persian techniques brought in by the Mughal royal court.Kathak usually features many skillfully executed chakkars, or turns in place similar to Persian whirling dervishes, which make the dancers’ skirts spread in a large hoop around them.
“Kathak is a dance that we introduced this year because we had a choreographer who, for the first time, we felt could actually teach the intricate dance,” Sobti said. “We also have two audiences to cater to [during the show]. We have a lot of diplomats, VIPs and professors who want to really see that South Asian aspect more, and we have students who like to hear and see a lot of energy.”
“This year, we wanted to add a more classical feel to the event as a whole. It’s otherwise mostly mash-ups of Top-40 songs and Bollywood songs and stuff like that. We had heard that people wanted a more classical feel,” Muralidhar said.
The coordinators made sure to include dances that fuse traditional South Asian dance with more modern or Western styles of dance. Bharathanatyam, a classical Indian dance, is fused with ballet and contemporary dance in the aptly named Classical Fusion. Sobti explained that while somewhat similar to Kathak, Bharathanatyam hails from Tamil Nadu in South India and has an even stronger tie to ancient temple dancing without as much Mughal influence. It features a demi-plie stance in which the knees are always slightly bent, intricate footwork and abhinaya — miming to depict storylines.
Some more recent additions to the 18-year tradition are Salsa Masala and Bollygroove. Salsa Masala is a collaboration of Bollywood with tango and salsa styles — an unexpected combination of two very different styles of dance.
“The two actually complement each other very well. Latin music lends itself well to Bollywood and classical Indian moves, and some of the slower Bollywood songs are great for tango and merengue dancing. Our mix even includes a track where Bhangra overlaps with [Shakira’s] ‘Hips Don’t Lie,’” Smiti Mohan (MSB ’15), one of the Salsa Masala choreographers, said.
Sobti explained that Bollygroove is a collaboration with Groove Theory that has worked differently every year, fusing hip-hop with Bollywood style.
“Bollygroove will surprise audiences this year because we have made it a little more hard-hitting since last year. There is definitely more of a distinctive hip-hop element,” Bollygroove co-choreographer Shantel Jairam (COL ’15) said.
No South Asian repertoire would be complete without spotlighting Bollywood-style dancing. Bollywood is India’s well-known version of Hollywood which frequently features an integration of music, dance and acting that can most closely be compared to Broadway and musical theater.
Bollywood Remix will feature the songs currently popular in South Asia, complete with over-the-top choreographies and sassy dance moves. Old School is a return to the height of Bollywood success.
“It has the cheesy — but still good — Bollywood songs from the ’90s that our parents loved. It’s also split into girls, boys and partner sections,” Muralidhar said.
Rangila stays connected to South Asian culture in other ways as well. Proceeds from the event will go to the Kumarappa Institute of Gram Swaraj
KIGS is a grassroots NGO that focuses on microfinancing and creating sustainable villages in India.
“We’ve had a pretty long history with them, and Rangila started as one of their sole funders,” Muralidhar said. “KIGS focuses on women and children, giving them the tools to have a life. … For the board and for us, we feel like we’re making an actual difference. It’s not like we’re giving the money to some megacorporation and we don’t know where the money is going.”
Though Rangila is based in a strong South Asian tradition, the event allows all students to come together.
“The most important thing is to understand that it’s not just a bunch of people of South Asian backgrounds who are doing this … Actually, probably only 30 percent, — not even, are [South Asian]. It’s a bunch of people enjoying themselves. And I think that’s what people relate to more than anything else — just that pure energy,” Muralidhar said.
Performances are Friday, Nov. 16 and Saturday, Nov. 17 in Gaston Hall. Tickets go on sale Monday, Nov. 12 in Red Square.

From breakdancing on the Hoya Break Squad to performing a fusion of Irish and South Asian dance styles on the Irish Step team, there is no shortage of opportunities to dance at Georgetown.
“I love the people, the swag, the style,” Groove Theory member Nancy Hinojos (SFS ’15) said. “Both the dancers and the audience share in the energy, the hype, the adrenaline rush.”
Though the university has no academic programs for dance, it is home to a wide array of student-run dance companies.
Membership in some groups, like Groove Theory and the Georgetown University Dance Company, requires students to undergo a rigorous audition process. Kelly Kimball (NHS ’16) has been dancing for 16 years and was overjoyed to become a part of Groove Theory after more than a week of strenuous auditions
“I absolutely love hip-hop dancing and have been dancing since I was 2, so dance has always been a huge part of my life,” Kimball said. “I knew that dance was something that I definitely wanted to continue in college.”
But not all groups require such dance expertise. Jacob Arber (SFS ’14) had never danced before coming to the Hilltop and joined the Georgetown University Ballroom Dance Team on a whim. Now, he’s the group’s president.
“I first became involved because I thought ballroom would be a fun and unique activity to try out,” he said. “I’d never danced before and wanted to learn how since I think it’s a useful skill”
Members’ reasons for joining dance groups are as diverse as their backgrounds.
“Many of the members in the Hoya Break Squad join because they want to explore a uniquely dynamic culture that is a blend of physical skill, musicality and individuality,” Hoya Break Squad member Davisson Han (MSB ’13) said. “Others come to hang out with their friends and learn cool moves to show off at parties. Whatever the reason, our end goal is to have a good time doing what we do.”
Although some members are involved in competitions, Han said that the squad, which is composed of nine performing members, promotes breakdancing culture in a welcoming environment.
“Simply put, we’re here to dance,” Han said.
Black Movements Dance Theatre has a similar attitude toward recruitment, with a focus on dedication and passion.
“We move with our bodies but dance with our souls,” said Bernadette Nelson (SFS ’14), co-director and publicity coordinator for BMDT. “We want to find members whose passion for dance is reflected by how they move.”
BMDT is a noncompetitive group that seeks to portray the cultural and ethnic diversity of the Georgetown community by expressing black traditions, values and experiences, according to Nelson. The group incorporates performances by spoken-word artists Vivian Ojo (SFS ’14) and Toby Campion(COL ’13).
While BMDT has had a strong presence at Georgetown for over 30 years, new dance groups have emerged on campus in recent years. Currently in its third semester, Dynami, the Greek dance troupe, has showcased the talents of its 16 members. The group was featured in an episode of D.C. Cupcakes on The Learning Channel and has performed at the French and Greek embassies.
Dynami member Andrew Theodotou (MSB ’14) said that the group has doubled its membership this year and has benefited from funding secured by the Student Activities Commission.
“Initially, we only had eight members and no funding or costumes,” he said. “SAC has been very accommodating to fund our costume purchases and travel expenses. It’s opened up some excellent opportunities for us since we can perform for free.”
But Dynami still lacks the resources to participate in competitions — a problem that Theodotou said puts a damper on growth.
“We don’t have the resources to achieve such authenticity as would be required to be successful at competitions,” Theodotou said. “But our group is far more motivated by camaraderie and personal expression than just the idea of winning a competition.”
Theodotou added that increasing practice space availability would help smaller groups expand their on-campus presence.
Irish Step Team member Catherine Razeto (COL ’13) agreed.
“Irish dancing is supposed to be done on hardwood floors, but that is not available to us on campus,”Razeto said.
The team currently shares space with other dance groups at Riverside Lounge, which houses dance practice areas.
Rangila, an annual cultural show and fundraiser for the Asha Kendra Hope Center in India, is perhaps the university’s biggest showcase of campus talent. More than 400 dancers appeared in Rangila last year, and participating groups ranged from the Irish Step Team to GU Jawani.
Theodotou said he sees room to expand on events like Rangila.
“We should have a single event dedicated entirely to cultural performing groups of all varieties,”Theodotou said. “An event like this would give year-round groups the opportunity to perform side by side.”
But for members of the Hoya Break Squad, raising awareness is a simple matter of holding practices in public.
“For Georgetown as a community, I believe that the best way to promote a group is to show what it’s about when people aren’t expecting it. When something spontaneous happens, people might discover they’re interested,” Han said.

For the sixth graders at Jefferson Middle School, the world just got a little bigger thanks to a group of Georgetown students involved with the One World Youth Project.
The organization, founded by Jess Rimington (SFS ’09), matches college students with local elementary and middle school students to teach them about global issues and to foster respect for different cultures.
Project managers Brian Potochney (SFS ’15) and AsjedHussain (SFS ’15) currently run Georgetown’s program.
The pair spent the week of July 9 in Kosovo for the OWYP annual Summer Training Conference this past summer learning how to manage and inspire a team of Georgetown students — reffered to as project ambassadors — as they took to the classroom.
“A big part of it was getting to know the people at the other hubs because when you’re working throughout the year over the computer, you don’t really get to have that face-to-face interaction,” Hussain said. “It really makes you invested in the organization.”
Once a week, eight Georgetown students travel to Jefferson Middle School to teach four classes of sixth grade students about local and global perspectives on the cultures of Kosovo, Turkey, Guyana and Pakistan.
Each OWYP lesson consists of two parts: a general lesson about different aspects of American traditions and an exchange activity, which usually includes a video made by the middle school students that portrays a specific aspect of the home country’s culture.
“Last time we did ‘what was your favorite artist or musician,’ so we picked some kids to sing some of it in front of the camera, and we are going to send it over to them [in Guyana],” project ambassador Nilesh Seshadri (COL ’15) said.
The goal of the exchange component is to demonstrate American culture to students at the partner school,and vice versa.
“One of the best things is that a lot of the people who are in these classes … they haven’t really been able to leave D.C., and if they have, it’s not been very far,” Seshadri said. “I think it’s really eye opening for them to see what another culture is like compared to what they actually view of this one city.”
But students’ insularity can sometimes slow down the teaching process.
“In the process of breaking [the material] down for the students, we have to go a little slower, so we don’t always follow the timeline that OWYP gives us,” Project Ambassador Camille Squires (COL ’15) said. “Getting them to understand that Turkey is halfway around the world and is a place — not a food dish — definitely takes time.”
Scheduling conflicts also arose this semester; the sixth grade teachers have to plan their lessons and simultaneously coordinate OWYP classes.
On the other hand, some Georgetown students had to leave the program. This semester alone, the program dropped from 15 to nine members because of commitment conflicts.
Stephanie Zhou (SFS ’15) became a project ambassador last spring but left the program this fall because it conflicted with other extracurriculars.
“I think it’s an excellent program, [but] in terms of curriculum, it is being ironed out,” Zhou said. “What’s unique about it is a lot of the curriculum; how it’s taught is based on how it’s interpreted by the individual peer project ambassadors. That’s really cool, but it also adds to the time commitment for the individuals projects.”
Hussain was not deterred by the decline in membership.
“We over-recruited because we knew that people would drop out,” Hussain said. “It is kind of a big commitment, and people don’t realize that originally.”
Georgetown’s OWYP branch aims to expand the program from six to 15 universities next year in order to begin a partnership with South Africa and India.
Hussain said he also hopes to expand Georgetown’s program to include seventh and eighth grade students. However, accomplishing this goal, will require additional committed project ambassadors.
“It would be like a three-year program. … It’s definitely a long-term goal,” he said.

The Social Innovation Public Service Fund will distribute $14,300 among four student winners announced last night in its first-ever round of grants.
Kristin Trivelli (NHS ’14), Tommy Larson (SFS ’13), Tyler Eldridge (SFS ’13) and the Hilltop Microfinance Initiative will each receive grant money to fund four social justice projects.
“We’ve seen about 25 [applications] so far this year, which has really blown us away,” said SIPS Director Tyler Sax (COL ’13). “That incredible demand is indicative of that huge gap that we’re filling; it really demonstrates what a need for funding for these types of projects there is.”
The first round of grant recipients have proposed a diverse set of projects with a common focus on building relationships and sustainable service initiatives.
“Sustainability is a major criterion,” said Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., a SIPS board member. “We mean ‘sustainability’ both in terms of continuing involvement here on the Georgetown campus, but also in connection to the communities we serve.”
SIPS offers funding to projects throughout the year drawn from $50,000 earned from the interest of the $1.5 million endowment allocated by the Student Activities Fee Endowment reform, which was created in February. The initiative considers applications on a rolling basis.
The four student projects will target different locations: Ghana, India, Haiti and locally in Washington, D.C.
Trivelli will receive $3,500 to work as a student nurse in a hospital at a cleft center in Guwahati, India, over winter break. She will also volunteer at an orphanage and at the nonprofit Pratyasha Foundation, which cooks and delivers meals to impoverished children. Beyond these immediate goals, Trivelli aims to make the trip an annual venture with a different goal every year.
“My goal with this SIPS fund is to create a sustainable annual trip from Georgetown to Guwahati to volunteer at one of these nonprofits,” Trivelli said “Every year you go with one goal, whether it is teach them how to take care of their teeth or hair hygiene or physical activity.”
On the other side of the globe, Larson will travel to Haiti, most likely during spring break, along with Naman Trivedi (SFS ’16), Caroline James (COL ’16) and Alex Koeberle (COL ’14), who helped Larson apply. Using $4,000 from SIPS, the group will install a solar-powered charging station where rural entrepreneurs will be able to make a profit charging cell phones and other small devices in Fonds-Parisien, a rural area east of Port au Prince.
“Normally these stations are powered by diesel, but those are expensive to fuel, so the idea of this project is to replace the diesel with solar,” Larson said.
In the long term, the system will eventually pay for itself, despite its high start-up cost.
“One [of our goals] is to set up a self-sustaining business model that, once the money comes back into our account, can be rolled out again and again to other areas of Haiti,” Larson said.
Larson added that his initiative aims to raise awareness about the plight the country faces in hopes of involving more students with initiatives in Haiti in the future.
“We’ve got a country that is almost a failed state right off our shores, and bringing more talent there would be just a great way to get them exposed to issues of development and also get a few other kids hooked on Haiti,” Larson said.
Like Larson, Eldridge will bring a sustainable business model to a poor community when he uses $1,500 from SIPS to travel to Ghana during winter break to implement a water treatment facility in the drought-stricken northern region. Eldridge is also aiming to raise $3,000 on fundraising website Crowdrise by Dec. 10.
Eldridge will teach local women how to run the business in partnership with Boston-based nonprofit Community Water Solutions.
“At least two current students both went to Ghana last year and one of the directors of the nonprofit itself is a Georgetown alum,” Eldridge said.  “I’d like to see it more of an institutionalized program at Georgetown.”
Alissa Orlando (SFS ’13), Alex Honjiyo (SFS ’13) and Craig Melcher (MSB ’13) of the Hilltop Microfinance Initiative  will use their SIPS grant of $5,000 to launch a program to build credit reports for small business and citizenship loans.
Founded in 2008, HMFI has focused on giving out small business loans to help local entrepreneurs who cannot obtain them from banks, which has enabled business owners to purchase materials necessary for their businesses. The grant will be used to expand HMFI’s scope to issue small credit-builder loans of $600, which their clients will pay back for the sole purpose of raising their credit score. In order to issue these loans, HMFI must report to a credit agency, which requires them to have a secure office space and mailing address. Part of the SIPS grant will be used to fund the organization’s rent at a new office.
“This is really momentous for our organization because it really allows us to empower our clients to a much greater degree,” Honjiyo said.
HMFI is composed of 25 Georgetown students, making it a match for SIPS’ emphasis on widespread student involvement.
“We have a certain bias towards those [proposals] that use more Georgetown students,” Carnes said. “We especially like seeing dialogue with faculty and especially students.”
Since there is no strict funding timeline in place, SIPS wants to get as many people involved this year as possible, with four to five new projects likely to be funded early next semester.
“We wanted to make a process that reflected the fact that entrepreneurship and ingenuity don’t come on a schedule,” Sax said.
Moving forward, SIPS looks to build upon what it considers a successful beginning and create a community around the organization.
“It’s great to have a few dozen students who have great ideas and want to apply, but what’s more important is turning it into a sense of community around those ideas,” Sax said. “Part of the original mission statement of SIPS was not only funding projects but aiming to create a culture of public service at Georgetown.”

Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) will join the Georgetown Public Policy Institute as a visiting distinguished professor of public policy in spring and fall 2013.
He will also give the 2013 Whittington Lecture, an annual lecture on public policy created to honor former GPPI associate dean Leslie Whittington, who died in 2001.
Lugar, who will have represented Indiana in Congress for 36 years when his term ends this January, serves as the Republican leader of the Foreign Relations Committee and is a former chair of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee.
“Given Sen. Lugar’s distinguished career in public service and his breadth of experience, we are honored to have him join us in 2013,” GPPI dean Edward Montgomery wrote in a press release. “Our faculty and students will benefit greatly from Sen. Lugar’s expertise in a wide array of policy areas.”
Lugar expressed excitement to join Georgetown next semester.
“I am looking forward to devoting deeper attention to a number of issues that have been a part of my Senate service and working with students and future leaders on how we can solve the world’s most complex problems,” Lugar wrote in a press release. “Working with Georgetown University and cooperating with other institutions, I know I can make a difference.”

Before the university terminated its licensing contract with Adidas Jan. 14, the sportswear giant attempted to defuse Georgetown’s concerns about employee severance at the former Indonesian plant PT Kizone, according to a letter obtained by The Hoya.
Following an Oct. 11 recommendation from the Licensing Oversight Committee, a body comprised of students and administrators, that the university cut its ties with Adidas, Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson sent a letter to Adidas representatives Dec. 3 saying that the corporation’s steps to help workers from the Indonesian plant following its closure “[could] not reasonably be considered a serious effort to effectively respond to this situation.”
Gregg Nebel, Adidas’s head of social and environmental affairs for the Americas, and Chris McGuire, director of sports marketing, disputed Smulson’s claims in a letter dated Jan. 3.
“Although the Adidas Group had no business with PT Kizone at the time of its closure — or for months before it closed — the Adidas Group has directly dedicated more towards the former PT Kizone workers than any other brand with our $525,000 in humanitarian aid,” they wrote. “The only difference with our actions is that we have distributed our humanitarian aid in the form of food vouchers and not cash.”
Nebel and McGuire said that while the Supreme Court of Indonesia had approved their manner of compensating workers following the plant’s closure, the distribution of their aid to workers had been prevented to date because of an appeal by the primary creditor, the State Bank of India.
“We remain committed to finding sustainable solutions to the Kizone case and we are confident that we are adhering to and, in fact, exceeding both the spirit and the letter of the codes of conduct our university partners require,” they wrote.
However, Georgetown administrators were not convinced.
“Quite frankly, their letter didn’t satisfy the university,” Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations said. “Within a week, the decision was made and acted upon.”
Fleming pointed to other companies that complied with Indonesian labor laws.
“Nike also had products produced in PT Kizone and Nike stepped forward and made a cash payment that has helped the workers,” he said.
Although the university sent a letter Jan. 14 cutting ties with Adidas, Fleming attributed the delay to school holidays and pointed out that the school ultimately followed through on the LOC’s recommendation.
“The difference between Dec. 15 and Jan. 14 was irrelevant,” he said. “The process of considering things like this in a university is complicated. … The important thing is that the university took a bold position — a clear position — to terminate the agreement.”
University spokesperson Stacy Kerr concurred.
“In these instances, we make sure that we are fully evaluating the matter, which we feel that we did,” she said.
According to Fleming, the LOC is promoting Alta Gracia, a clothing company that pays a living wage to its employees, as an alternative to companies like Adidas. However, the school said it would reconsider Adidas’s contract if the corporation adequately responds to the dispute.
“If you don’t hold out that opportunity, they’ll never change,” Fleming said. “One would think that at some point, an organization that relies on these licensing agreements to be able to sell products that people want to buy might come to the conclusion that they should revisit this issue.”

Georgetown’s regular decision undergraduate applicant pool for the Class of 2017 was almost identical to that of the previous year, which bucks a trend of application growth in previous years.
A total of 20,025 students applied in the early and regular decision cycles, down just 0.1 percent from last year’s 20,050. Of those, 13,289 were regular decision applications, down slightly from last year’s 13,351. The Class of 2016 continued a trend of year-to-year application increases, with a jump from the previous year’s 19,228 applications.
Although the College received the largest number of applications out of the university’s four schools, with 11,714, this figure marked a 2.5 percent decrease from last year. The School of Foreign Service had the second largest pool, with 3,690 applicants, marking an increase of 1 percent.
A record number of students applied to the McDonough School of Business and the School of Nursing & Health Studies, with the MSB experiencing an 8 percent increase, with 3,370 students applying, and the NHS receiving 1,251 applicants, a 4.2 percent increase.
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said these figures, which reflect national trends, have stemmed from ongoing concerns about the economy.
“Students are more concerned with job security,” he said. “They are gravitating to science and pre-med tracks.”
While the total number of applicants remained consistent with last year when a little over 20,100 people applied, this year, the diversity of the student body continues to expand, Deacon said. African Americans made up 7.6 percent of the applicants, Asian Americans 15 percent and Hispanic Americans 11.8 percent.
International students also made up 12.8 percent of this year’s applicant pool. Between 2,200 and 2,400 applicants applied from China and India.
“We are not doing anything new to attract students from those areas,” Deacon said. “There is just a sort of natural momentum.”
As has been the trend in the past few years, the most applicants have come from California, with 2,500 applicants, and New York, which had 1,800 students apply.
Although the early acceptance rate for the Class of 2017 was a record low at 13 percent, Deacon said he expects the overall acceptance rate to remain consistent at about 16 percent.
Citing a report by the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education, which indicates that the number of high school graduates peaked in 2010 and will decline until 2020, Deacon said he was pleased with Georgetown’s continued success in attracting students to the university.
“Since the total pool of possible applicants is declining, Georgetown has had to, in effect, increase its market share just to stay even,” he said.
Maintaining the same levels of applicants has proved to be a challenge for some schools this year. Boston College’s decision to add a 400-word essay to its Common Application supplement this year caused the number of applications to drop from 35,000 in 2012 to 25,000 this year, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Other peer institutions that use Common App had mixed results. According to a report in The New York Times, Dartmouth College had 23,052 applicants in 2012 but 22,400 in 2013. At Vanderbilt University, 30,870 students applied this year, which marked an 8.9 percent increase over last year when 28,348 submitted applications.
Georgetown is among a small group of universities, along with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that do not use the Common App. That Georgetown maintains such a high number of applicants without using the application system is a point of pride for Deacon.
“If 10,000 students didn’t apply because of one essay, how good can your numbers be?” Deacon said. “Georgetown’s are real.”

Edmund Burke III, a research professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz, analyzed the significance of the Mediterranean’s geographic location in the development of the region during the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies’ 2013 Annual Symposium Wednesday.
This year’s conference focus is “The Mediterranean Re-Imagined” in honor of late Georgetown professor Faruk Tabak, author of “The Waning of the Mediterranean, 1550-1870: A Geohistorical Approach.”
Burke’s keynote address, “Models of Mediterranean Modernity: The Perspective from the Longue Durée,” emphasized the Mediterranean’s centrality to a broader world history.
“In this talk, I seek to reexamine against the background of world history how the Mediterranean came to modernity,” Burke, who is also director of UC Santa Cruz’s Center for World History, said. “Middle Eastern problems are not just Middle Eastern problems.”
Ecologic and economic factors were key in shaping the history of the many regions that surround the Mediterranean, Burke added. In particular, the Little Ice Age, a period of significant cooling in temperatures that affected Europe from the mid-14th to 19th century, precipitated to a great decline in the continent’s relative prosperity.
“The Little Ice Age cumulatively devastates Mediterranean agriculture,” Burke said.
The Mediterranean’s population, which was equal to China’s population in 1000 CE, was only one-fourth of the Chinese population by 1800, he added.
Despite the negative impact of the Little Ice Age, Burke said, Europe achieved preeminence as the world’s most powerful region in great part because of the economic benefits it reaped from its exploration and later colonization of the New World.
“Europe’s overseas colonies provided a strategic advantage in the new local struggle for empire,
Burke said. “As a result it achieved results well above the new global norms.”
However, before global colonization, the Mediterranean Sea helped civilizations in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa prosper. The role of the sea in precipitating cross-cultural maritime trade guaranteed Mediterranean-based peoples certain economic advantages over those who did not have access to warm water ports.
“For millennia, the prosperity of the region was ensured,” Burke said.
However, the rise of trade routes through Indian and then Atlantic Oceans reduced the sea’s importance to Northern Europe.
While Mediterranean countries today take advantages of oil reserves, the region was at a developmental disadvantage during the Industrial Revolution due to its lack of coal and iron. This, in particular, stymied the process of industrialization in much of the Arab world.
“It’s a time when we can begin to start to rethink the modern Arab world in bigger ways and indeed in global ways,” Burke said.
Burke is currently working on a book, “The History of the Modern Mediterranean, 1450-1950,” that will examine themes from his keynote address.
Nabil Matar, professor of English at the University of Minnesota, said he thought Burke underemphasized some aspects of Europe’s dominance of Mediterranean cultures.
“This is, in my view, not sufficient. In my view there is also the military side,” Matar said, citing British and French attacks on Mediterranean infrastructure.
Matar presented his own work on the Mediterranean as an obstacle to Arab cartography at the symposium Thursday afternoon.

Former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) encouraged students to engage in public service in the first of a four-part lecture series in Gaston Hall on Tuesday morning.
The four lectures, to be given over the next few years, address Clinton’s vision for the future of the United States.
Clinton said that, after leaving the White House, he enjoys his current work in service and development through the William J. Clinton Foundation.
“People are always asking me, ‘Don’t you miss being president?’ I tell them the truth — I do,” Clinton said. “But I think that it’s foolish to spend one day of your life wishing to do something you can no longer do. … It’s always best to focus on what’s at hand and what you can do.”
According to Clinton, the United States currently has about 1 million non-governmental organizations, not including 355,000 religious institutions, that which also contribute to public service. Half of these institutions were founded after 1995. Clinton praised the independence of U.S. NGOs.
“This NGO movement is kind of a thorn in the side of governments,” Clinton said. “And like everyone else, they’re not always right, but they basically push the envelope of liberty and global responses.”
Clinton attributed the rapid increase of private citizens’ involvement in public service to new technologies, citing the decrease in median donation from $56 after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami to $26 after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. He attributed this difference to increased accessibility of donating due to technological advancement.
Clinton identified four requirements necessary to properly perform public service: interest in people and caring for purpose, policies and politics.
“Most people will get in real trouble and abuse power when they forget the purpose of power is not to impose will, but to let other people get empowered,” Clinton said.
Clinton stressed the importance of respect in development work.
“People are not just defined by their per capita income,” Clinton said. “There are incredibly dignified people who manage to compose a life out of poverty. From them, we can learn how to get their children and others out of poverty … I say that because it’s important for you if you want to do this work is to realize that everybody has some kind of story like that.”
Clinton connected the tradition of storytelling to the ability to discuss service and poverty.
“In my house … you couldn’t tell a story unless you proved you could listen to one. … I learned that you can’t speak unless you learn to listen, not in a way that people can hear,” he said.
Clinton related this idea to current U.S. politics.
“Ask yourself, ‘Did this person say that thing because they wanted it to be heard, or because they wanted to be on television?’” Clinton said. “If you want democracy to work, people have to be able to hear each other. It depends on what you say and how you say it.”
However, he warned against glamorizing poverty.
“Don’t ever romanticize poverty — it’s overrated,” Clinton said. “But don’t degenerate them. There’s dignity there.”
The speech was followed by a question-and-answer session moderated by former Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13). Questions were collected from Georgetown students and students from Clinton’s own Hot Spring High School in Hot Springs, Ark.
Audience members, who gave Clinton three standing ovations, said that they enjoyed the speech.
“I liked his stories and his conversational speaking style,” Caitlin Donahue (COL ’13) said. “He did a really good job of connecting well with the audience.”

Vice President Joe Biden described the benefits of increased U.S. engagement in Asia in an address at The George Washington University on Thursday afternoon.
Biden cited three American goals in the region during his speech, which was sponsored by the Center for American Progress: stronger alliances, a new defense strategy and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement. He said that the United States would focus on proliferation, human disasters, conflict between nations, the threat posed by North Korea and the risks of disrupting commerce.
“In the Asia-Pacific, we saw a region of remarkable promise, but also genuine uncertainty and political risk,” Biden said to an audience of 250 invited guests, including Indian Ambassador to the United States Nirupama Rao.
Biden specified the payoff of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as part of the pivot to Asia, suggesting that its benefits would bolster stability and increase prosperity in both Asia and Latin America.
“To spark new growth, there has to be fewer barriers at and behind our borders, protections for intellectual property to reward innovation, new commitments to make sure everyone plays by the same rules because that’s what attracts investment and jobs, as well as greater economic integration,” Biden said.
The vice president, who will travel to the subcontinent and Singapore next week, pointed to the growth of India while outlining policy implications for specific countries in the region.
“Twenty, even 10 years ago, some might have suggested that India be left out of discussions about the Asia-Pacific,” Biden said. “[Today] India is increasingly looking east as a force for security and growth in Southeast Asia and beyond.”
Biden also spoke to the health of the U.S.-China relationship.
“We do not view our relationship and future relations with China in terms of conflict or the talk of inevitable conflict,” Biden said. “We view it in terms of a healthy mix of competition and cooperation. A competition that we welcome; it’s stamped into our DNA.”
The vice president addressed fears in some European capitals that the pivot to Asia will mean fewer resources for U.S. efforts in the Middle East.
“Europe, just like us, will benefit greatly as well from stability in the Pacific, in Asia. And by the way, there is no reason why we cannot bring greater focus to the Asia-Pacific and keep our eye on the ball in the Middle East,” Biden said. “Folks, that’s what big powers do. To use the vernacular, we can walk and chew gum at the same time.”
Georgetown associate professor of international relations Michael Green, who also serves as vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Biden was trying to reaffirm that American interest in Asia remains high, despite turnover at the State Department.
“There are real questions out in Asia about who will champion Asia policy and the pivot after Hillary Clinton and Kurt Campbell,” Green wrote in an email. “Beijing is telling the smaller ASEAN states that America comes and goes, but China will always be there, so they had better rethink who their real friends are.  In that context, Biden’s attention to the region is welcome, but is it enough?”
Biden concluded his speech with a defense of economic and political freedom — and a plug for the administration’s economic policy.
“We’re better positioned than any time before to be able to do it all. I know you’ll think it sounds like a campaign assertion I’ve been making for years, but America is back,” Biden said. “I think it’s because of the enduring strength of our people and of our system. For all our difficulty in education for our children, they’re still taught to challenge orthodoxy.”

When students voted to pass the Student Activities Fee Endowment reform in February 2012, their votes had an impact far beyond campus by creating the Social Innovation Public Service Fund. The first SIPS grant winners did service projects abroad with the funds they received.
The SIPS Fund awarded its first grants last fall from a $1.5 million endowment that was established by the SAFE reform. SIPS has awarded grants ranging from $1,000 to $13,000.
SIPS provided funds to Kristen Trivelli (NHS ’14) to travel to Guwahati, India, last winter. Trivelli initially became interested in volunteering with Operation Smile, which treats facial deformities in children but ended up also volunteering at an orphanage for girls and the Pratiyasha Foundation, which brings meals to the slums of Guwahati.
Trivelli said her work with Pratyasha was life changing.
“It was amazing, because literally we spent $12 and we fed over 80 kids every Sunday,” Trivelli said. “They are the most honest kids you’ve ever met. … You’re hugging and playing with them, and you’re like, ‘How do they have so much joy when they have nothing?’”
Trivelli has continued to work with Pratyasha since returning and plans to raise funds by selling laptop cases made from fabric she bought in India. The ongoing involvement was an important part of the SIPS application process.
“It was something we always talked about, how to take my experience and apply it to the Georgetown community,” she said.
Nitya Ramlogan (SFS ’13) travelled to Oaxaca, Mexico, on SIPS funds with a plan to market the crafts of local artisans to Georgetown students.
Ramlogan connected with a community partner in Oaxaca, which has now hired her as a consultant.Ramlogan is working to bring the Oaxaca artisans’ goods to the Georgetown Farmers Market.
“The project has even exceeded the boundaries I originally had in mind, and become a broader project, but the connection with Georgetown will be a lasting one,” she said.
Alumni are also eligible to receive SIPS funding.
Claire Charamnac (SFS ’11) is the co-founder of Women LEAD, which works to empower young Nepalese women through intensive, yearlong programs focused on real-world skills, leadership and confidence. She described the SIPS grant, awarded to Women LEAD earlier this year, as the largest her organization has received.
“SIPS is a critical part of our success,” she said. “They’re our biggest partner at this point.”
Women LEAD is now working to lengthen the program from one to two years and to expand the program to other countries.
In addition to project assistance, the fund provides programming, including lecture series and innovation labs.
SIPS Development Director Michael Grasso (SFS ’14), who is a former director of personnel for The Hoya, said that the majority of SIPS-funded projects are international because that is where students’ interests tend to lie. The organization also aims to expand its domestic efforts. SIPS tries to go beyond just paying grantees’ travel expenses.
“What SIPS does is it provides this extra layer of providing resources, connections and funding,”Grasso said. “Our preference is always to support and fund the programmatic aspects of an applicant’s project, meaning materials and support for them. We prefer to partner them in what they’re actually doing on the ground, instead of just getting there.”

The Millennial Trains Project is taking a new approach to train rides by carrying groups of young entrepreneurs, artists and thinkers across the country as a mobile community to explore innovation and social change.
This past August, Ann Yang (SFS ’15) joined 23 other participants on the project’s inaugural ride from San Francisco to Washington. Over the 10-day trip, the group stopped at a half dozen cities along the way for seminars by mentors from various academic fields and local leaders.
Former Georgetown University Student Association President Patrick Dowd (SFS ’09) founded the Millennial Trains Project this past year. The idea for the project came from a project Dowd led while on a Fulbright Scholarship in India in 2010.
Sonia Vora (SFS ’15), who serves as Dowd’s chief of staff, and Sacha Simmons (SFS ’09) were also passengers on the train. Simmons is the founder of Sweat Everyday, a nonprofit helping people remain physically active, and she studied the exercise habits of residents of different cities during the cross-country trip.
Additionally, advisors for the project include Alyssa Lovegrove, associate director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative and Jeff Reid, director of the Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative.
Yang found out about the project when she met Dowd during her internship at 1776, a D.C.-based incubator for nonprofits. Dowd said he was impressed by Yang’s confidence and eagerness.
In order to be eligible to participate, potential passengers, all between the ages of 18-34, must pitch an idea for a creative project online and use crowd-sourcing to raise the $5,000 participation fee.
Dowd notes that Yang had no trouble raising such a significant amount of money.
“She was really good at crowd funding,” Dowd said. “She raised the $5,000 necessary to go on the trip in two weeks.”
Part of Yang’s success was because James Hunt, an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship, pledged $500 to the project if Yang was able to raise an additional $2,000 from Georgetown alumna.
“To me it was a very clever idea, and it seemed to be kind of a unique way to combine an experimental trip with philanthropy,” Hunt said.
Yang’s journey culminated in “The Joy Project,” a documentary which juxtaposed interviews with Millennials against interviews with members of the Greatest Generation. Yang focused the project on risk-taking across the generations.
“I think that the recession actually created a unique space for people to take risks to do what they love,” Yang said.
Yang said that students at Georgetown are reluctant to take risks.
“We have this culture where risk aversion is seen as the way to go, and my conclusion from my trip is that risk aversion is stupid and people need to embrace failure because success hinders learning,” Yang said. “College should be about this environment where people can make mistakes.”
Yang is still editing her footage into a longer video project.
“The final platform is going to be called ‘Vibrant Day’ — it’s basically going to be about people who’ve taken risks to do what they love,” Yang said.
Other passengers on the train worked on projects ranging from research on food waste to access to poetry. Yang was the train’s youngest passenger and celebrated her 20th birthday while in Nebraska.
MTP recently garnered media attention with its 12th-place ranking on National Geographic Traveler’s “Traveler 50” list of “People, Places, and Ideas Changing the Way We Travel.”
Dowd said the project was a huge success, meeting and surpassing his hopes.
“I think that these crowd-funded train rides can be like the road trips of our generation,” Dowd said. “It’s a whole community that we have on these train cars and it’s really cool.”
MTP’s next journey coincides with Georgetown’s spring break in March, when it will take participants from Los Angeles to Miami.
“I think a lot of other people at Georgetown would be good candidates,” Dowd said. “It’s all about experiencing the world and engaging with really diverse people.”
Yang feels equally enthusiastic about the project’s success.
“It changed my life,” Yang said. “It really reduced my anxiety about what was going to happen.”

At least half of Georgetown undergraduates will venture off the Hilltop to study abroad during their college career. But while opportunities in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and France remain popular, more and more American students are exploring less traditional destinations in Asia and the Middle East.
In November 2012, the Institute of International Education announced in its Open Doors Report that China, now ranked just behind those four European options, has jumped in popularity as a study abroad destination. Other countries with significant gains included Brazil, Costa Rica, India and South Korea.
Director of Overseas Studies Craig Rinker said that Georgetown is consistent with the national trend, which he attributed to increased accessibility and the expanded global nature of academia.
“Europe is where study abroad was founded, but as the world becomes smaller, students are drawn to newer locations,” Rinker said. “Particularly as academia becomes more global and more academic disciplines address global issues, students are going to find ways to go to those areas of the world they are studying about.”
To students, emerging study abroad destinations in Asia and the Middle East can be more exciting than their more established European counterparts. For example, Sarah Wang (SFS ’14), who lived with a host family for a year in Tokyo, stressed the “once-in-a-lifetime” chance that many non-traditional study abroad options present.
“Asia is kind of the place where if you have a chance, you should go,” Wang said. “When you talk about it later in your life, it’s really awesome to say, ‘I went to India’ — not that France isn’t [great], but it’s just different.”
Michael Paslavsky (COL ’14), who studied abroad in Dublin, said that although he was satisfied with his experience, he understood the appeal of Asia.
“Growing up, it wasn’t that unusual to go to Europe, so I think Europe is often viewed more like a vacation place,” Paslavsky said. “Japan is so far away, so when you are given the opportunity to go there, it’s Georgetown students doing what they normally do, seizing an opportunity.”
Study abroad destinations are often closely tied to students’ academic interests, particularly foreign languages; those who plan to study abroad in Asia often enroll in intensive programs to gain proficiency in the local language in preparation. These study abroad programs offer cultural and language immersion as a key component for reaching fluency.
“People who study abroad in Asia generally are focused on becoming fluent in their language, but for me I just wanted a different type of people, a different type of culture, and that wouldn’t be defined by a language,” Paslavsky said of his time in Dublin.
But as Asia grows in popularity as a serious study abroad option, Europe’s “touristy” reputation deepens, thanks to its familiarity.
“You kind of know what you’re getting when you go to Europe,” said Matthew Serrone (COL ’14), who previously visited Europe but chose to study abroad in Japan instead. “They often very much cater to Americans who want the European experience without fully diving in. There are definitely cultural differences, but I don’t think they’re as extreme. People, I think, want something more unknown, unexpected.”
Rinker agreed and added that there is sometimes an unnecessary stigma attached to European study abroad programs.
“We have many students on campus who look at what they’re studying and their language preparation and have it intimately tied into Western Europe, for instance, and there’s nothing wrong with that,” Rinker said. “I think oftentimes the thought now is that you can’t be current or the cutting edge by sticking to Western Europe.”
The Chronicle of Higher Education also recently reported that the recent economic downturn in Europe and the relative economic rise in Asia have affected schools’ ability to fund such study abroad programs, both stateside and abroad.
According to the Chronicle, Asian countries have continued to invest in higher education, while European university budgets have been continually slashed as Europe battles its recessions.
“With few exceptions — notably Germany — institutions lack the deep pockets needed to fuel international activities,” the Chronicle reported.
James Burr (MSB ’14), a finance student who studied abroad in Barcelona, chose to study in Europe during the recession, however, to observe the recession’s effects on the region.
But while Burr agreed that Europe has become touristy, he argued that it falls on the traveller and the student to seek the local experience in any city.
“It’s like Washington, D.C.,” Burr said. “If you’re a tourist, you’re not going to find The Tombs.”
Rinker emphasized that Europe still provides a valuable cultural experience.
“There are significant nuances to living in Europe, and I think sometimes because there’s a common language, people devalue those nuances,” Rinker said.
Another unique feature of European study abroad programs is the ease with which students can travel between countries. In contrast, students who study in Asia generally stay in one particular country because they are often limited by transportation methods and cost.
“Asia is not the type of place where you can country-hop on weekends like Europe,” Kristin D’Alba (COL ’14), who studied abroad in Shanghai last fall, said. “You really do stay in the local area, but I like that because you get to really know one city.”
Overall, despite the national trend toward non-traditional areas, Rinker said that Georgetown would continue to seek new study abroad sites based on fit, rather than trend.
“We’re hoping that programs are relevant to what’s currently happening in the world, and there is a demand from students for it,” Rinker said. “Part of the challenge is that you want to ensure that there’s quality and that experiences can be managed in terms of student support and in terms of health and safety. We’re very intentional about the programs that we develop.”
Rinker added that despite the slow move away from European study abroad experiences, Europe will always be a valued player in the world of academia.
“As the world becomes a smaller place, I think more and more students will consider studying in countries that may not have been so prominent 10 or 15 years ago, so I expect Latin America, Asia and Africa to continue to grow. But I don’t think you’ll ever see a decrease in demand for the more traditional locations like Europe,” Rinker said. “Just because Europe is accessible doesn’t mean that it’s easy and that there’s not cultural value there or academic disciplinary value there.”

Participants on this year’s Alternative Spring Break will see a more cohesive, multidimensional program incorporating reflection into all aspects of the trip than in previous years.
Since its inception in 1974, Alternative Spring Break has sent students to locations from Detroit and the Alabama Gulf Coast to engage in a weeklong service venture.
With applications for ASB trips hitting an all-time high of 340 last year, board members have chosen to make this a year of growth for the organization.
“One of our focuses as a board this year is for it to be a formative year for ASB,” Head of ASB Board Stefan Rajiyah (SFS ’14) said. “We really want leaders to be focused on more this year and hopefully for years to come.”
ASB leaders are looking to increase the amount of participant involvement both before and after trips to bring home the message of ASB. In previous years, the program offered limited pre-trip activities and little follow up.
“My experience with pre-trips has been, ‘Let’s get together and get to know each other and go out to dinner.’” ASB trip leader Karyn Miller (NHS ’15) said.
To that end, Miller, who will be co-leading a Native American immersion trip to North Carolina, plans to take her group to the National Museum of the American Indian ahead of spring break.
The new effort will also increase post-trip activities with ASB-wide events that may include a week focused on social justice and reflection.
At a leader retreat in September, board members emphasized the importance of examining the effects of their actions, especially with respect to planning these trips.
“The intentionality aspect is not just for our trips but also in the structure of ASB itself,” Appalachia trip leader Samantha Lin (SFS ’14) said. “The leaders went on a daylong retreat, and everything we did was intentional.”
One goal of this increased attention to intentionality in the planning stages of the ASB trips is to bridge the gap between community service and cultural immersion.
“In the past, trips have been categorized as either service or immersion trips, and we don’t see this dichotomy,” ASB Marketing Chair Kayla Corcoran (COL ’15) said. “All trips are cultural and justice immersion trips.”
Trips will also explore the sociopolitical context of their communities.
“We’re not just doing activities to take up time,” Corcoran said. “We’re going to think about the historic relevance, the cultural relevance and the political relevance, and we’re going to make sure that our participants have the tools to think about those kinds of issues.”
Former trip participant Katie Bui (COL ’16) appreciated ASB’s broader focus.
“I think that while you can learn from just doing community work, putting an emphasis on the trajectory of your work is much more important,” Bui said.
By selecting meaningful activities for participants to engage in both before and during the trips, the ASB board hopes to encourage participants to increase involvement with CSJ and other service programs during the year.
“We’re looking at ASB not just as a one-week commitment but as a commitment to social justice that goes beyond that week,” Corcoran said.

The United States Agency for International Development recently awarded Georgetown’s Institute for Reproductive Health $19.8 million for a five-year research project.
The project, Fertility Awareness for Community Transportation, aims to spread awareness in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia about reproductive health and family planning methods. According to a university press release, in those developing countries, the risk of a woman dying due to pregnancy and childbirth is currently one in 75, which is nearly 100 times the level in developed countries. Thus far, IRH is considering conducting research in Rwanda, India, Uganda and Nepal, but the list of countries has not yet been finalized.
“Family planning, in general, has been shown to have a significant impact on the world,” IRH Director and Founder Victoria Jennings said. “What we do know from the research is that if women are in a position to be able to avoid pregnancy when they don’t want to get pregnant, and if they have other options in their lives, it really does create a better world for everybody.”
“It helps women’s education. It helps the health of the family. It helps their ability to educate their children, and helps their economic lives. So it’s really the best poverty reduction intervention that there is,” IRH Deputy Director Rebecka Lundgren said.
For the FACT project, IRH will conduct research through implementation science, which involves gathering information through surveys, focus groups, interviews and panels to determine the results of increased education. As a result, the research will provide evidence on any direct benefits of increased knowledge and understanding of sexual health among men and women.
“I’m really excited about trying to come up with some ways of really raising awareness and understanding, especially among younger, newly married couples who are not very well reached by programs that are out there already and to reach [them] in a large enough scale that we can really make a difference,” Lundgren said.
Over the last 25 years, USAID has given IRH nearly $150 million in funding, which Lundgren attributed to the institute’s record of success.
“We have a long track record of successful interventions or projects to help women, men, and also adolescents to understand their fertility and make decisions to protect their health based on that,”Lundgren said.
For example, IRH developed the Standard Days Method, which scientifically tracks and monitors women’s reproductive cycles and has been proven to be successful through independent studies.
“Under Victoria Jenning’s leadership, IRH has demonstrated critical contributions in creating receptive environments within communities around the world so they can embrace evidence-based reproductive health programs,” Georgetown University School of Medicine Executive Dean HowardFederoff said in the press release. “These programs make a significant impact not only on individuals but entire communities. We’re proud that IRH is one of many groups making a global impact by addressing this challenge.”
The project is expected to enter the field by January.

	In his spare time, philosophy professor Madison Powers made a website at the end of last year to supplement his teaching on environmental justice. While many such sites might include an assortment of external links and excerpts, Powers’ product offers more than 200,000 original words – the equivalent of about four 200-page books.	Powers, a senior research scholar at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics, created fewresources.org to approach environmental issues from a social justice perspective.	A few months after creating the site for his students in “Global Justice/The Environment,” Powers expanded it to serve as a resource for a population beyond the Georgetown student body, and it now has an international audience clamoring to study this hot topic. He created the acronym FEW, which stands for “food, energy and water.”	While Powers receives no revenue from the site and does little to market it, it regularly receives 6,000 unique visitors a month, with hits coming from 120 different countries. India represents the second-largest group behind the U.S.	“I don’t want anybody’s money,” Powers said. “I want it completely intellectually independent so that no one can raise any suggestion that the point of view in there is a function of someone other’s agenda.”	Powers’ research centers on global justice and public health issues.	“As a philosopher, I’m interested in not just the policy, but I’m interested in every place in that policy discussion where there’s an ethical inflection, where some issue of justice gets raised,” Powers said.	Students in Powers’ class use the site as a resource to supplement their experience in the classroom.	“The website isn’t a textbook, but it kind of takes the place of a textbook because it’s better than a textbook,” Kafele Kossally (COL ’14) said. “It’s basically a repository for basic information about the topic.”	Powers does not, however, see the website as a replacement for the more traditional symposium model traditionally favored by philosophers.	“I would say that it is no substitute for writing books and articles or teaching classes,” Powers said. “It is a way of putting in one place a lot of information that’s of an interdisciplinary nature.”	Although Powers said the website has been successful for spreading his research on the environment and social justice, he does not see the online model as applicable to all fields of philosophy.	“Practical ethics, bioethics and the stuff I do, there’s a good case for this kind of online format that’s different, with the aim of really helping to shape the rising of a certain disciplinary niche within applied ethics,” Powers said. “I don’t think there’d be much need for that in metaphysics or most of the areas of philosophy that are fairly self-contained.”	Students have also found that the website has improved in-class discussion.	“It’s definitely more interactive because the links you choose reflect your interests so even though we pretty much read the same thing every day, everyone brings different information to class, so it makes it more refreshing,” Kossally said.	Powers said he receives 15 to 20 emails a month from visitors to fewresources.org, allowing him to interact with his audience and learn about the environmental issues that are significant in other parts of the globe.	Fifty entries in and with online content double the length of his last book, Powers plans to maintain and grow the site for the foreseeable future.	“I’ve got the copyright and the ownership of the electronic stuff,” Powers said. “I don’t see any reason [to stop]. I’m just getting going.”

	The U.S. Department of State discontinued its $3.3 million budget for research grants that advance the study of Russian and Eastern European society, culture and politics this year, eliciting concerns from professors about the future of graduate and undergraduate programs.	Federal support for Russian and Eastern European research began in 1983 as part of the Title VIII Grant program, which aims to maintain expertise about various world regions. The State Department authorizes these grants on a yearly basis.	According to Harley Balzer, an associate professor of government and international affairs and former director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies, the program originally aimed to promote research and scholarship during the Cold War.	“With the threat of nuclear war between the two superpowers, knowing everything we could learn about the USSR and its Warsaw Pact clients was absolutely crucial to our security,” Balzer wrote in an email. “The goal was to make sure we could support graduate students to learn the languages, help junior faculty with research support to aid them in the tenure process and also encourage senior scholars to continue doing important work in the region.”	Balzer added that it is not surprising that support for these grants is waning today, as Russian scholarship has become less relevant since the USSR broke up in 1991.	“It is more difficult to make that case now,” Balzer wrote. “It really was a decision within the State Department, and they are chronically short of funds for a number of important things.”	Department of Slavic Languages associate professor Lioudmila Fedorova expressed dismay that the study of Russian language, culture and society has been de-emphasized.	“I was surprised. I was saddened. I’m very anxious,” Fedorova said. “We cannot underestimate Russia and its impact on modern political life.”	While Balzer agreed and cited the importance of Russia to the study of foreign policy and Eurasia, he acknowledged that the current post-Cold War political environment does not necessarily demand State Department funding.	“I would advocate our using some of our scarce budget resources to support language and area studies more broadly, rather than privileging any one region,” Balzer wrote.	Fedorova, however, voiced frustration that only tangible strategic and economic interests dictate the country’s academic focus.	“I think it’s very dangerous to look only at the areas of research that can give you something practical in return, the effects of which you can easily see,” Fedorova said. “It leads to a very limited picture of ourselves and the world.”	Nevertheless, both Balzer and Fedorova said that these cuts are too recent to feel their full impact. In particular, Fedorova noted that the cuts would primarily impact doctorate students and those pursuing postdoctoral work, as well as professors who wish to visit Russia and conduct research. The lack of funding for Russian study programs could also dissuade students from pursuing a major in these areas.	“I can foresee that in the long run, students who take Russian for say, pursuing a career in history of Russian or area studies, would think about other areas,” Fedorova said.	According to Fedorova, the funding cuts have resulted in the elimination of positions and even entire departments at other universities. Fedorova pointed to State University of New York’s Russian language program, which became online only, and Arizona State University, Indiana University and the University of Illinois, which have all suspended or cut research grant and scholarship programs related to the field.	“People are losing their jobs actually because of this tendency,” Fedorova said. “The situation in the field is very tragic.”	Georgetown, however, has managed to remain relatively unaffected thanks to the U.S. Department of Education’s Title VI program, which also allocates funds for particular regional studies. Title VI specifically funds National Resource Centers, which offer graduate degrees and language instruction focused on specific regions of the world; CERES is considered a National Resource Center.	“We are a direct beneficiary of that, and we hope that that will continue in the future, although that, too, is threatened,” Loring said. “That’s the big thing that we really don’t want to happen.”	According to Loring, as many as 20 scholarships could be lost if Title VI is defunded, and numerous study opportunities and course offerings would be affected.	Balzer suggested that the Title VIII cut is illustrative of a larger trend.	“We are weakening our capacity to compete economically, protect ourselves and to promote our ideas,” Balzer wrote. “It reflects a short-sighted view of the future, and one may only hope that the result will be merely significant, rather than tragic.”	Fedorova expressed hope that Georgetown would not abandon its program, regardless of funding.	“I would be very glad if the university could undertake any steps to somehow compensate or recognize the importance of this field,” Fedorova said. “That would be wonderful.”

	National Security Advisor Susan Rice discussed the future of the Asia-Pacific and announced in Gaston Hall on Wednesday that President Barack Obama would visit the region in April.	Obama’s scheduled trip in October was canceled due to the government shutdown.	“Rebalancing toward the Asia-Pacific remains a cornerstone of the Obama administration’s foreign policy. No matter how many hot spots emerge elsewhere, we will continue to deepen our enduring commitment to this critical region,” Rice said. “Our friends in Asia deserve and will continue to get our highest level of attention.”	Rice laid out the Obama administration’s plan for the next three years.	“Ultimately, America’s purpose is to establish a more stable security environment in Asia, an open and transparent economic environment and a liberal political environment that will respect the universal rights and freedoms of all,” she said.	Rice said Obama would focus on four areas to build growth in Asia: enhancing security, expanding prosperity, fostering democratic values and advancing human dignity.	“Our military presence in the region is vital,” Rice said. “Not only to deter threats and defend allies, but also to provide speedy humanitarian assistance and unmatched disaster response.”	Rice specifically addressed China in terms of security and asserted that the United States remains committed to improving its military relationship with the nation.	“When it comes to China, we seek to operationalize a new model of major power relations,” she said. “That means managing inevitable competition while forging deeper cooperation on issues where our interests converge in Asia and beyond.”	Rice, who previously served as ambassador to the United Nations, related her experience on the UN Security Council to future work with China.	“I sat on the Security Council of the United Nations with China for over 4 and a half years working on many of these issues,” she said. “I know all too well that we have some fundamental differences that cannot be minimized. But I also know that our interests on many of the major challenges of our time can and should be more closely aligned.”	Specifically, Rice said the United States and China should work together to rollback the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction programs.	“We are prepared for negotiations provided they are authentic and credible, get at the entirety of North Korea’s nuclear program and result in concrete and irreversible steps toward denuclearization,” she said.	Rice also discussed the economic outlook for the region in the years ahead, citing that about a quarter of U.S. exports go to Asia.	“By the end of 2016, we aim to transform our economic relations with the region, through dramatically increased U.S. exports, the implementation of the most ambitious American free trade agreement in decades and closer cooperation with China, India and other emerging economies in pursuit of sustained global growth,” Rice said. “As an Asian-Pacific nation, the United States is working to shape a more dynamic future for entire region by promoting U.S. business and forging new ties for commerce.”	The most crucial economic policy, according to Rice, is the Trans-Pacific Partnership economic agreement.	“The rules we establish though this agreement will set standard for future trade agreements,” Rice said, citing workers rights, environmental protections and intellectual property, among others.	Rice said that the United States needs to improve its economic relationship with China, saying a poor relationship is detrimental to each nation.	“If meaningful action is not taken now, this behavior will undermine the economic relationship that benefits both our nations,” she said.	As for women in politics, Rice said decreasing the gender gap remains key to fostering economic growth.	“This single change has the potential to do the most good for the greatest number of people,” she said. “Those two factors are closely correlated – simply put, the smaller the gender gap, the stronger the economic growth.”	Rice concluded by addressing the United States’ response to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.	“We are working around the clock to help Filipino people begin rebuilding the country. Recovery will be a long process, but the U.S. will stand beside the Philippines every step of the way,” she said.	Audience members were impressed and optimistic about what Rice said for the Asian region moving forward.	“I was especially interested with how Rice addressed increasing the participation of women in the workforce in Asia,” Enushe Khan (MSB ’17) said. “Especially after the Hilary Clinton talk last week, I found the emphasis on the advancement of women in Asia to be very interesting.”

Eight Georgetown students received the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship for their spring 2014 semesters abroad last month.
Established by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000, the Gilman Scholarship offers awards for American undergraduates who are traditionally underrepresented in U.S. study abroad programs, including students with high financial need and non-traditional students.
The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Department of State sponsors the scholarship, which emphasizes fostering relationships between the United States and the peoples of other countries.
The number of Georgetown scholarship recipients marks a slight increase from the number of scholarship winners in recent years, which Georgetown Overseas Studies Advisor Tineka Lebrun attributes to the work of Lauren Tuckley, associate director of the Office of Fellowships, Awards and Research.
“The Gilman Scholarship’s goal of providing accessibility to study abroad matches well with our own goals as a university by providing additional funds that supplement a student’s financial aid package,” Lebrun said.
After returning to the United States, Gilman scholars are required to complete Follow-on Service Projects within their home institutions or communities, with the intent to promote international education and the scholarship. Examples of potential projects include presenting the country of study to young students or organizing a pen-pal program between classrooms at home and abroad. The service project proposal is a key part of the scholarship application and is heavily evaluated during the selection process.
Study abroad locations for the eight Georgetown recipients this year include South Africa, Portugal, Brazil, Japan, India, Italy and Jordan. In total, over 2,300 scholarships of up to $5,000 each will be awarded nationwide this academic year.

Daisy Franco (SFS ’15)
Destination: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Why did you apply for the scholarship?
Study abroad is very expensive and flights to Brazil even more so. The scholarship is a huge financial help. Also, there is a proposal needed for the scholarship, and that allows me to showcase what I did in Rio. My proposal involves my internship in a women’s rights [nongovernmental organization].
Why do you want to travel to Rio de Janeiro?
I am studying Portuguese and Latin American Studies, so it is the perfect place. It is also the opposite of D.C. and will force me out of my comfort zone.
How do you think this scholarship will help your future goals or ambitions?
It is making studying abroad possible, and now I have the opportunity to live what I am studying, which is very important. School is more about sitting in a classroom; you have to live what you learn.

Mary Byrne (NHS ’15)
Destination: Cape Town, South Africa
Why did you choose to travel to Cape Town?
I have been to Rwanda twice before, I went once this past spring break with other Georgetown students and two Georgetown professors to examine development in the country, and then I had an internship working at the Rwandan National Reference Laboratory in the summer. These experiences in Rwanda really sparked my interest in learning more about other parts of Africa, especially in terms of health development. I have a significant interest in women’s health. I hope to be an OB-GYN. South Africa has one of the world’s worst maternal mortality rates, and many campaigns and programs have been launched to combat this issue. I hope that while studying abroad in South Africa I could either set up an internship or do volunteer work with some of these organizations.
Is there anything specific you’re looking forward to next semester abroad?
Learning more about South African culture, volunteer experience, exploring a new place, everything!
How do you think this scholarship will help your future goals or ambitions?
Between graduating from Georgetown and going to med school, I hope to take a gap year to work in some sector of health and development, ideally in a location in Africa. Studying abroad in Cape Town will help me solidify this interest and also provide me with a greater likelihood of getting a job in Africa, as I will have significant experience and knowledge of African culture.

Alberto Gallegos (COL ’15)
Destination: Tokyo, Japan
Why do you want to travel there?
I want to travel in Japan because I’m very interested in the Japanese culture, and this semester I’m taking intensive Japanese and so integrating myself in Japan would help to develop my language skills. Sophia [University], in particular, because you didn’t have to take all the classes in Japanese; I’m a beginner so I’m still developing my Japanese, so I could take an intensive Japanese course there while still taking my other classes in English.
Is there anything specific you’re looking forward to next semester abroad?
Just getting a chance to travel. I’ve never been anywhere outside the United States except for a little state in Mexico in the upper north of Mexico, so I’ve never really traveled anywhere else so this is very exciting.
How do you think this scholarship will help your future goals or ambitions?
In the future, I plan to take part of the Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme, which is basically I go to Japan for two years to help high school students to learn English. I don’t really teach, but I help a teacher there while I’m there, like a student aide. That’s what I want to do in the future for about two years and being able to travel to Japan first to see if I really do want to do that would be great, and the scholarship gives me $3,000 that I can use to accomplish my goal.

Christina McGrath (COL ’15)
Destination: Florence, Italy
Why did you apply for the scholarship? 
There was an email that was sent out through GOFAR and [the Georgetown Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program] that was about the Gilman, encouraging people to look it up and apply. I did some research and found out that it was not a very huge application. I fit all the qualifications for it. The idea that interested me was that it was more than just saying, this is why I deserve money to go abroad. There’s a service component to it, which was appealing to me in a sense that it was a little different from the other grants that one might apply for.
Why do you want to travel there?
I am an Italian and art history double major. Florence, to me, is the epitome of everything that has ever appealed to me about Italian and art history. Florence is basically the cradle of the Renaissance, which might sound cliche but is my biggest interest. The Renaissance, the Baroque period, these all have a center in Florence. Between all the excellent Renaissance art that’s there, not to mention all literary traditions that arose out of Florence, you can think of Machiavelli, Boccaccio, Petrarch — all of these authors had very strong ties to Florence. To me, I feel that Italian culture, as we know it, definitely was formed in a great degree in Florence. And one tiny little fact: Italian, as it is spoken today, standard Italian that is not dialectal, grew out of the Florentine dialect; it was formed mainly by Dante, Boccaccio, various authors who wrote in the vernacular of Florence, which is now standardized Italian.
How do you think this scholarship will help your future goals or ambitions?
My hope for after graduating is to enter directly into a Ph.D. program in Italian. I hope to ultimately become an Italian professor. For me, I feel that this scholarship is enabling me to get more out of my time in Florence, and I feel that this time in Florence will be integral not only to my personal development, but to my professional development as I discover more about Italy and the aspects of Italian culture, language and art that interest me and will inform my career as a professor.

Juan Gonzalez (COL ’15)
Destination: Pune, India
Why do you want to travel there?
I am incredibly passionate about economics, as of this semester actually. India is booming economically. It’s facing a plethora of social issues, and I believe that it’s a good place to study development, economics and to witness the growth of a country first hand.
Is there anything specific you’re looking forward to next semester abroad?
From the people that I’ve talked to that have been to India, they have nothing but good and crazy things to say, so I’m looking forward to just immersing in this completely different world to ours — just a different culture, different system, different everything.
How do you think this scholarship will help your future goals or ambitions?
For the future, I want to be or eventually become a United States congressman, and I feel that by studying abroad and studying the economic issues faced by India, the United States can learn a lot from that, especially since they have three times the people. I just feel like there’s something to learn there about how to go about implementing economic equity.

Elyssa Skeirik (SFS ’15)
Destination: Amman, Jordan
What are you studying?
My course of study is I am a culture and politics major with a focus on identity politics, but my regional specialty is the Middle East, so I’m also taking Arabic.
What was your reaction upon learning that you earned this scholarship?
I was super excited because I have been saving money for this for basically my whole life to be able to travel there, but now because I can use the scholarship for my basic travel expenses like a plane ticket, I can use money that I was saving to do extra stuff. For example, I can travel more while I’m there.
How do you think that this scholarship will help further your future goals and aspirations?
It’s going to enable me to travel instead of just staying in Jordan — going to other places in the region, hopefully Israel, hopefully Cairo if it’s safe — and so having that experience will really help me with my future studies, to be able to see different places.
***
Keegan Terek (COL ’15)
Destination: Lisbon, Portugal
Why do you wish to travel there?
I’m required to study abroad for my Spanish and Portuguese Studies major, and I wanted to go somewhere where I wouldn’t be surrounded by English-speaking Georgetown students. So, I applied with Independent Status to the CIEE Program in Lisbon. I’m also interested in traveling to Lusophone Africa some day, and Portugal has a stronger connection to those countries than does Brazil.
How do you think that this scholarship will help further your future goals and ambitions?
The scholarship gives me the opportunity to study Portuguese intensively and exclusively, an experience I have never had. As I hope to use foreign languages in my future career, advanced proficiency in Portuguese will be undoubtedly beneficial to me.
***
Colleen Roberts (COL ’15)
Destination: Cape Town, South Africa
Why do you wish to travel there in particular?
I was really interested in going to a place I haven’t been before, going to a new continent and also going to a location that I didn’t think I might get up and go to on my own. I figured that later in life, if I wanted to go to Europe, I could like easily go, so I was really interested in going somewhere kind of distant, so I decided on the continent of Africa. South Africa in particular I chose because I was really interested in the history. I took a comparative history course on South Africa and the United States during my sophomore year, which really solidified my interest in going.
How do you think that this scholarship in particular is going to further your goals and aspirations?
I think that the scholarship’s really helpful because it means, for one, that I don’t have to take out an additional loan for study abroad to cover those extra costs, and the study abroad experience I expect to be something that’s really formative and really unique in my undergraduate career, so I’m really glad that it’s allowing me to further that opportunity.

Inspired by the dialogue of the #BBGU campaign, Georgetown students provided personal experiences, thoughts and questions about their life at Georgetown University as students of color through the #BLGU and #BAGU campaigns. The former, on Dec. 12, focused on issues related to Georgetown’s Latino community, while the latter, on Dec. 16, highlighted the Asian and Pacific Islander communities.
“Taking time out of your studies to tweet because you want your voice to be heard @BLGU_ #BLGU #BLGU_” —Viviana Jaramillo Balbin (MSB ’15)
Organizers of both #BAGU and #BLGU were motivated by recent dialogues and took to social media. Both events utilized sites such as Facebook and Twitter to spread awareness of the events and personal experiences of participants. #BAGU coincidentally followed the popular #NotYourAsianSidekick, started the day before, which helped to publicize the event.
#BLGU additionally reached out to the community using social media to promote the event.
“Our hopes were manifold: Raise awareness amongst students, faculty, administrators and alumni with regards to the Latina/o experience; create solidarity in the Latina/o community; attain recognition by administrators, that they pay attention to the concerns of the Latina/o community,” #BLGU organizer Kevin Magana (COL ’14) wrote in an email. He also mentioned attracting the alumni community and inspiring peer institutions to create similar events.
Using social media as a medium for the events additionally allowed participants to build off each other’s experiences.
“Though the event was simply tweeting and posting about the experiences of being in a specific minority group, I think it really helped members from different communities to realize that we all have common threads,” Vietnamese Student Association President Anthony Do (NHS ’15), who organized #BAGU, said.
Participants felt that the online nature of the event allowed them to comfortably post their thoughts.
“We’re using these hashtag campaigns because we don’t feel there’s a … space on campus where we can engage in this type of dialogue and be honest about it” Aya Waller-Bey (COL ’14), who orchestrated the #BBGU, said.
“Didn’t really notice the color of my skin or how thin my wallet is until I came here to @Georgetown. #BAGU” —Anthony Do (NHS ’15)
Students tweeted and posted about personal experiences, both positive and negative, relating to their race in the Georgetown community.
“In terms of content, the inspiration simply came from personal experiences. The APIA community is often associated with being the ‘model minority.’ Along with that, people often believe that we are not marginalized and do not experience disparities,” Do wrote in an email.
Through these online protests, Georgetown students have taken the initiative to spread awareness about their cause and to start a necessary conversation about diversity.
“I would love for everyone who feels like their identity has yet to be represented to do [something similar]. The reason why all this has happened in such quick succession is people are motivated for change and that this is a conversation that should be had now,” Claytia Gonsalves (SFS ’15), who helped Waller-Bey with publicizing #BBGU, said.
“‘Why are you hashtagging BAGU? Indians aren’t Asian.’ Thanks, but we’ll decide what we are and aren’t. #BAGU” —Prayuj Pushkarna (SFS ’17)
The #BAGU Twitter feed also addressed the controversial topic of what it means exactly for a person to consider him or herself Asian.
“I think the fact that we’re all in one label of ‘Asian,’ what happens is it makes certain groups invisible. A lot of it applies more to East Asians, whereas I am Vietnamese and identify as Southeast Asian Vietnamese American,” Linh Tran (COL ’15), a member of the VSA and East Coast Asian American Student Union, said. “Our history is based on immigration … so it sort of sets us different from other groups within the Asian community. I think it’s important because no one knows about it.”
“Bleeding #hoya blue, but also #BLGU_ #BLGU” —Sarah Audelo (SFS ’06)
Participants in both events hope #BLGU and #BAGU will help spread awareness among both the student body and the administration for these student concerns about diversity.
“A long-term goal was to catch the attention of the university and show them that these issues are important. I love Georgetown, I bleed Hoya Blue, and I will be proud to hold a Georgetown degree,” Do wrote. “I really want to see Georgetown as a whole practice Cura Personalis and be inclusive as a whole. I always wondered why Georgetown does not have an Ethnic Studies Program, so maybe these movements could raise it to their attention.”
The students organizing the protests stressed that these online protests should not be interpreted as an outlet to express negative feelings toward Georgetown. Rather, their aim is to improve the school they already love.
“The word ‘protest’ warrants a very negative type of opinion and people think we’re just criticizing and complaining and that we don’t love Georgetown, but there’s so much pride. … These protest and initiatives and campaigns are coming from a place of love for Georgetown,” Waller-Bey said.
“These are important voices #BLGU. We are listening. Keep the conversation going. @Georgetown” —Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J.
The conversations about diversity will not end after these Twitter protests. The organizers from #BBGU, #BLGU and #BAGU are still in communication to plan future events and action for the spring semester.
“Using the stories shared from these movements, as well as information that several other students have compiled, the goal is to create a formal proposal to push for some changes to be made on campus,” Do said. “Of course, the dialogue from these movements will continue. Some participants have been talking about starting blogs to continue the dialogue and keep the conversation going.”
Waller-Bey hopes that the different race and ethnicity-based Twitter protests can unite over common themes and goals in order to form a joint committee. Still in its early stages, the committee is entirely student-driven and will include the black, Hispanic and Asian communities as well as white allies.
“We’re currently looking for themes that were expressed in both the #BBGU thing, the #BLGU thing, and we’re hoping to do the same for #BAGU to from those types of experiences that we saw, be able to consolidate those and express more efficiently how we can solve those, what the university can do on their end, what we’re suggesting the university be doing and then propose different solutions in that manner,” Waller-Bey said.
The committee plans to meet early in 2014 to draft a proposal for the university.
“The conclusion to be drawn is that GU administrators need to act to make Georgetown a more inclusive place for its Latina/o community, as well as other minority groups. To overlook this would be to unnecessarily inflame passions and cause further efforts to gain attention towards these issues,” Magana wrote.

Indian women of the “untouchable” caste increase their economic and social standing after converting to Christianity, a recent study by Berkley Center research fellow Rebecca Shah shows.
The research, presented at the Dec. 13-14 “Christianity and Freedom” conference in Rome as part of Georgetown University’s Christianity and Freedom initiative, focused on Dalit women in a violent Indian slum and related both the community and tenets of Christianity to a willingness to invest in their personal, economic and social future.
“What actually keeps the poor in poverty and keeps them in persistent poverty is this sort of fear of investing in the future, a fear of long-term investments,” Shah said.
According to Shah, Christianity is an important factor in changing this fearful mindset. Much of the change in the converted women’s behaviors stems from a sense of belonging in the supportive community Christianity brings.
“One thing we noticed with these women was being part of the [Christian] community … it sort of gave them the sense of some sort of hope that the future was attainable,” Shah said.
The close community additionally caused some women to sense a change in identity.
“There is a sense of belief that ‘I can make a difference, I can invest in my children’s future,’ and that to a great extent comes by their involvement in these independent churches,” Shah said.
Shah noted in her findings that although the Christian women were more often faced with domestic violence, in part due to the new independence that comes with converting, these converts were more likely to tell someone about the violence. Sixty-three percent of converted Christians experienced domestic abuse, with 57 percent reporting the incidents. By contrast, only 7 percent of Hindu victims reported abuse, while there were no reports from Muslim women, according to Shah.
Allen Hertzke, co-chair of the Christianity and Freedom initiative’s steering committee, attributed the change in identity and newfound independence to the conversion experience itself, not just the presence of a strong community.
“So it’s not just the fact that Christianity is instrumental in creating this sense of community or community networks or community support, but that the Christian message and the Christian conversion experience itself actually shaped the way these women saw themselves,” Hertzke said.
Robert Woodberry, another researcher who presented his findings at the conference, additionally attributed the change in behavior of Dalit women to factors involving Christianity beyond the community aspect. Woodberry believes changes in views on identity and self-worth were primarily due to the tenets of Christianity.
“In terms of theological beliefs, the idea that everyone is created in God’s image … is a theological resource within Christianity that can transform people,” Woodberry said.

Students and professors met the first Jesuit pope, Francis I, during the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs conference “Christianity and Freedom: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives” in Rome this past December.
The conference, which ran from Dec. 13 to Dec. 14 at Pontifical Urbaniana University, was organized by the Berkley Center’s Religious Freedom Project and supported by Baylor University, the Witherspoon Institute, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation and the program on Religion and Innovation in Human Affairs. The Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty contributed organizational and planning support.
The conference, a culmination of the two-year study on Christian contributions to freedom throughout history and in modern Christian minorities, included presentations by research fellows on their findings, such as Rebecca Shah’s work on the transformative effect of Christianity on underprivileged Indian women.
The RFP’s goals included increasing awareness of worldwide religious persecution against Christians and illustrating the societal destabilization caused by this persecution. “Our most basic goal was to highlight the contributions of Christians to their own societies, including contributions to the concept and practice of religious freedom for all,” RFP Director Tom Farr said. “When you repress or exile minority groups, such as Christians and others, who have contributed so much to your own societies, you are not only harming them — you are harming yourselves.”
On the last morning of the conference, the speakers and staff, including Farr, Associate Director Timothy Shah and students Kevin Sullivan (SFS ’14) and Nick Fedyk (SFS ’14), took part in a private meeting with Pope Francis.
The encounter occurred in the Clement VIII room in the Apostolic Palace.
“Walking into the papal apartments and then meeting the Holy Father is a beautiful combination. The grandeur, history and tradition of the building demonstrate the glory of the Church, while the humility and personability of the Holy Father provide the much-needed human element,” Sullivan wrote in an email.
Pope Francis posed for a photograph with Farr and Shah, holding Sullivan’s Georgetown scarf. “His gesture and good humor with the Georgetown scarf I provided for the picture (I wanted to give it as a gift but he refused!) connected our history and mission of the university — building the Kingdom of God by molding men and women for others — to that of the representative of the Church,” Sullivan wrote. “It truly became an instant moment in Georgetown history.” At the end of the meeting, Pope Francis received a Spanish copy of Tim Shah’s book “Religious Freedom: Why Now?” from Farr. The Pope left with a request for the group: “Pray for me!”
Those in attendance carefully noted the words of Pope Francis upon their meeting.
“Although he does not know English very well, he carefully chose his words when he asked us: ‘Pray for me.’ There was the Holy Father, a man so full of prayer and blessings and baby-kissing, and yet he was asking us to pray for him,” Fedyk said.

A professor at Georgetown for 34 years, Adhip Chaudhuri was, in many senses, a lifelong student.
Chaudhuri, who retired last year, died Jan. 13 after a three-year battle with lung cancer. He was 62 years old.
While his field was economics, Chaudhuri’s currency was knowledge. It was a trait he inherited from his parents, a chemist and housewife, and one he would pass on to his two children, Maya (SFS ’13) and Neal (COL ’16).
Throughout his Georgetown career, Chaudhuri inspired students, friends and colleagues alike with his zeal for international economics and natural aptitude for making learning fun.
“He would always come home and tell us which class he liked better that day, the morning or afternoon section, based on how they responded to his jokes,” Maya said.
As children, Neal and Maya were often forced to memorize maps, countries and flags as well as plants — an interest Chaudhuri developed while following around the gardener at his boarding school in Kolkata, India.
“He was always slightly disappointed that my sister and I weren’t as obsessed with plants as he was,” Neal said. “I think part of it was the Latin names and part of it was the natural beauty.”
A Man for Others
Born in 1951 in Ghazipur, in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Chaudhuri was the youngest of four siblings. After graduating at the top of his class from St. Stephen’s College at Delhi University and then the Delhi School of Economics, Chaudhuri immigrated to the United States in 1972.
Chaudhuri spent his days as a doctoral candidate at Columbia University, applying the social justice philosophy of John Rawls to economics in his thesis. He also took time to absorb American culture, frequenting Tom’s Diner, which would later be featured on the television show “Seinfeld” and adopting the New York Giants and New York Yankees as his own teams.
Georgetown, where he started teaching in 1979, gave Chaudhuri the opportunity to apply his economic theories of social justice in a tangible manner.
Chaudhuri was the first economics professor to incorporate community based learning, allowing students in his “International Trade” class to work with the Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor as a fourth credit option.
“At a lot of schools you really can’t bring things like justice or social welfare in the department. Georgetown allowed him to do that,” Maya said.
Clearly, Chaudhuri led by example. Maya, who was heavily involved with the Center for Social Justice during her time at Georgetown, is now working with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, while Neal is a leader with the university’s ESCAPE retreat program.
One of Chaudhuri’s proudest moments was when he had the opportunity to bring Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen to campus to be honored for incorporating ethics into his work.
“He didn’t always give off his social justice. You could tell he was passionate about it, but he didn’t shove it down your throat,” Neal said of his father.
Community in Diversity
Chaudhuri’s love of economics was not bound by the front gates. Through Georgetown, Chaudhuri had the opportunity to conduct research and lecture in Austria, Vietnam and Qatar. It was this final post, at the School of Foreign Service campus in Doha, that would be the most formative for the professor.
The same examples and jokes he used at Georgetown came out in even stronger force in the smaller, more intimate Doha setting.
Kim Fernandes (SFS-Q ’11), a student of Chaudhuri’s in Qatar, relished the opportunity to engage with the professor, whom she cited as part of her inspiration for pursuing graduate studies in education policy.
“He made so many jokes in class, God bless him,” Fernandes recalled. “He’s honestly just an excellent professor. It mattered so much that we were able to talk to him not just about class but things like our research interests as well.”
Chaudhuri was well-loved at the university, twice receiving SFS-Q’s teacher of the year award.
Cura Personalis
From memorizing box scores and baseball statistics for his favorite teams to spending hours solving crossword puzzles in The Washington Post — always in pen — Chaudhuri pursued all facets of his life with the same intellectual fervor that he brought to the classroom.
When not debating the benefits of the Ricardian model with students, Chaudhuri was a key player in a long-standing bridge club consisting of professors across the history and economics departments.
Joining the club soon after his arrival at Georgetown in 1979, Chaudhuri spent many a day first in the seminar room of Nevils where the economics department was then housed and later in Intercultural Center classrooms with members of the club, among whom he was noted for his incredible wit.
“He was so inventive among the types of jokes he would say. He would make analogies to sports games and would use metaphors like ‘touchdown’ or ‘getting on the scoreboard’ to describe the bridge game,” said David Goldfrank, director of the Medieval Studies program and longtime bridge club member.
Known as the “Wise Man of the East” among members, it was in this group that Chaudhuri would confide updates of his illness and find solace, joining in for the occasional bridge game until this past summer.
Chaudhuri also developed strong ties within the Jesuit community, where he found men who shared his curiosity for learning and passion for interfaith dialogue.
“He loved talking about religion, though he didn’t necessarily consider himself a Christian,” Maya said. “Georgetown priests are so invested in interreligious dialogue. It was something he wouldn’t have gotten at any other university.”
Though raised in the Hindu tradition, Chaudhuri grew close with several Jesuits, including Fr. James Walsh, S.J., Fr. Leo Lefebure, S.J., and Fr. James Reddington, S.J., the last of whom presided over Chaudhuri’s wedding in Dahlgren Chapel and the baptisms of Maya and Neal, whose mother, Margaret McBride, is Catholic.
A constant theme throughout Chaudhuri’s life was the sanctity of knowledge, teaching his children that it was unacceptable to leave a book on the floor. At the same time, knowledge also represented a source of fun.
Maya and Neal recalled Safeway trips extended by their father’s histories of the products on nearly every aisle and carpool rides, during which an afternoon snack was awarded only after the siblings and their friends could identify, in both English and Latin, at least three plants the car passed on its way home.
Chaudhuri is survived by his wife, Joanne Kinney Smyth, his children, Maya and Neal, his former wives McBride and Una Chaudhuri, and two siblings.
According to one Chaudhuri’s closest friends, Amit Shah, his passion for teaching never waned, even when cancer began to consume his life.
“Right until the very end when he couldn’t stand up to teach, he would say to me, ‘I have to sit down and do this,’ but he did it because he loved doing it,” Shah said. “He could’ve quit a while ago, but he loved having people respond to the concepts and issues in such a real way.”

Georgetown Campus Ministry hosted an interfaith dialogue jointly sponsored by the Muslim and Hindu Student Associations on Wednesday night in Makom.
Now in its third year, the event has helped students open up to the discussion of differing religious views, according to former President of the Interfaith Student Association Aamir Hussain (COL ’14).
“People didn’t know how to [talk about religion] without offending anybody … but I think that through the interfaith dialogues, students have been able to really talk on a personal level for the first time,” he said.
Throughout the evening, members of both religions chatted and intermixed seamlessly. The only moment that segregated the students was when the room broke into prayer. However, this provided an opportunity for students to witness the practices of the other faith.
The event began with presentations by the presidents of both the Hindu and Muslim student groups, which gave the audience a background of the fundamental elements of each faith.
Despite the fundamental differences in the foundations of these religions, such as the monotheistic Islam versus the polytheistic Hinduism, the faiths have similarities.
“Small actions, that’s a great similarity [between Hinduism and Islam]. … Small actions can be worshipped,” MSA President Erva Khan (NHS ’15) said.
Leaders of both the MSA and the HSA found similarities within their respective religious practices, including traditions such as fasting and washing or showering before praying.
Overall, the event took place without a hitch, and members of both faiths learned about the other’s belief system and culture.
“It was definitely a learning experience. Certain topics caused more conversation than others, but we didn’t have any controversy,” Khan said.
Hussain acknowledged that there could have been testy moments of discussion, but that the students were ready to talk about all subjects. One such controversial topic is the ongoing hostilities between India and Pakistan in the Kashmir region. Recently the site of increased violence, Kashmir has always been an obstacle to peaceful relations between the predominantly Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan.
“Hindu-Muslim conversations can have many obstacles, [but] students are prepared to reflect on difficult topics,” Hussain said.
However, this interfaith dialogue event was designed to avoid controversial topics, intended instead to promote the aspects of either religion that bond the students as people.
When the students were divided into small groups of both Muslims and Hindus, they drew upon commonalities between the faiths in order to find common ground. Within the discussion sections, students had the opportunity to discuss an array of topics, including how their religion has impacted their beliefs on various subjects, from science and religion to morals and family.
The Muslim-Hindu interfaith event has grown in size since the first event two years ago, and involved participation from students in multiple campus organizations, in addition to members of the respective religious groups’ boards.
Hussain was pleasantly surprised with the discovered shared ideals of the two faiths and emphasized the need for more interfaith dialogue at Georgetown in the near future.
“How we grew up, how we got our morals, how our families influenced us, a lot of that is really similar. I was impressed by how close we actually were,” Hussain said. “This event [was] the next in a series of steps designed to make interfaith work more central to student programming.”

Gary Bass, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton, presented his most recent book, “The Blood Telegram: Nixon, Kissinger, and a Forgotten Genocide,” on Thursday at the Mortara Center.
The book provides the first full account of the role that former President Richard Nixon and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger played in the 1971 genocide that resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of people and over 10 million refugees fleeing from Pakistan to India.
“In this case, the [United States] is intervening from the beginning, on the side of the military dictatorship engaged in crimes against humanity, against its own population,” Bass said.
On March 25, 1971, the West Pakistani army – Bangladesh was then part of Pakistan and known as “East Pakistan” – participated in one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the century. They launched a strict crackdown, Operation Searchlight, on ethnic Bengali civilians in East Pakistan after demands that the West Pakistani military junta accept the results of the 1970 Pakistani democratic elections.
“No country, not even the United States, can prevent mass genocide wherever it happens,” Bass said. “But this is a case where the atrocity is being carried out by a close U.S. ally that prizes its relationship with the Untied States.”
Kissinger and Nixon were allegedly aware of the situation as the United States Foreign Service informed them and numerous cables were sent back to the United States with documentation.
Archer Blood, an American diplomat in Bangladesh, sent a strongly worded telegram, written by himself and other Foreign Service officers, which came to be known as the Blood Telegram.
“Our government has failed to denounce atrocities. … We, as professional civil servants, express our dissent with current policy and fervently hope that our true and lasting interests here can be defined and our policies redirected,” the telegram read.
According to Bass, the ambassador to India, Kenneth Keating, even confronted Nixon and Kissinger about the genocide against Hindus in the area.
“Kissinger makes it clear that he knows about, not just killings, but the targeting of Hindus,” Bass said.
The United States also supplied weapons to West Pakistan. Furthermore, when war broke out, the United States did not press West Pakistan not to use weapons supplied by the United States, did not impose conditions for using the weapons and did not publicly condemn them.
“There are U.S. tanks rolling through the streets of Dhaka. There are U.S. jeeps with U.S. machine guns mounted on them shooting at civilians in Dhaka,” Bass said. “You might think this is foreign policy on auto-pilot. But, in fact, Nixon and Kissinger are very engaged in South Asia.”
Nixon and Kissinger, against a strict Congressional arms embargo, sent weapons to assist the West Pakistani army, which killed countless Bengali civilians. Against persistent advice from advisors in the White House, Nixon and Kissinger proceeded with the shipment of weapons through Jordan and Iran.
“They don’t make appeals to theories of executive power,” Bass said. “They don’t ask for a memo explaining why this is part of commander-in-chief authority.”
According to Bass, White House tapes reveal that, in a meeting before they decided to send the weapons, Nixon asks Kissinger, “Henry, is it so much against our law?” After Kissinger explains that it is, Nixon responds, “Hell, we’ve done worse.”
Attendees found Bass’ discussion both informational and entertaining.
“I just find it fascinating, especially with the White House tapes,” Jonathan Kennedy (GRD ’14) said. “Never before has there been such an accurate portrayal of what the most powerful leaders in the [United States] were talking about and it really adds some unique insight.”
Bass pointed out that it was also strategically unwise to supply weapons to West Pakistan. Once India’s military got involved in December of 1971, it was clear that India would prevail.
Bass also attempts to understand why Nixon and Kissinger would support West Pakistan.
“To be fair, the opening to China is a huge and important achievement,” Bass said. “It helps to win the Cold War and end the Vietnam War, and I want to give full credit to Nixon and Kissinger for that.”
Bass also pointed out that the main reason Nixon supported West Pakistan was because he feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would lead to Soviet domination in that area. This would undermine the power of the United States in the world as well as the power of America’s new ally, China.
Bass debated both sides of the war, highlighting the complexity of the issue. He pointed out that Nixon and Kissinger’s goals came at a price for Indians and Bangladeshis.
When asked whether Kissinger commented on the book, Bass said that although Bass did not receive a response from Kissinger on his book, Bass did attempt to get his opinion.
“I work very hard to present all perspectives but Kissinger ignored me three times, and turned me down once,” Bass said. “But he’d be stupid to respond because then it would create a news story.”
According to Bass, the book gives a deeper insight on the issue of why Nixon and Kissinger took risks to equip West Pakistan with weapons. Although it was perceived as statistically and morally unwise, he explained Nixon and Kissinger’s behavior from a different angle.
“Nixon and Kissinger were often propelled by emotion, instead of calculations,” Bass said.

Pakistani Ambassador Jalil Abbas Jilani discussed the turbulent political and economic relations between the United States and Pakistan in McGhee Library on Tuesday.
The School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program organized the event as part of the Lunch with an Ambassador Series, which was designed to give Georgetown students, alumni and professors the opportunity to learn about current affairs from the international figures who are actively participating in world-changing policymaking.
The fully-booked event created an opportunity for conversation about the tense relations between the two countries since 2011, when Osama bin Laden was killed in a secret U.S. military operation in Pakistan.
“The years 2011 and 2012 also witnessed a low in U.S.-Pakistan relations. … They suffered a great deal,” Jilani said.
Although Pakistan is a U.S. ally regarding the “war on terror,” Americans and Europeans accused Pakistan’s military and security forces of protecting bin Laden from U.S. intelligence agents. The Pakistani government categorically denied these accusations, but the ramifications of this event as well as continued drone strikes targeting al-Qaida in the northern tribal areas have heightened tensions between the nations’ political leaders.
Despite this contention, the ambassador remained optimistic about current and future relations between the two nations, arguing that current cooperation bodes well for the future.
“The current level of engagement we have in both countries gives every reason for both sides to be satisfied with the level of cooperation that is going on not only on the economic front, but also on trade, counter terrorism, intelligence, military to military cooperation,” Jilani said. “Also I think at the level of the parliament of Pakistan and the U.S. Congress have good cooperation and good understanding about the interaction that is going on.”
The ambassador focused on Pakistan’s energy crisis, defense and counter-terrorism operations and economic and trade issues.
“On the economic front, the situation looks very good. The GDP has seen a significant growth in the last six months, the fiscal deficit has been reduced, the GDP has been increased, the government has also been able to pay back the circular debt in a matter of one month almost $5 million, which has increased the productivity of various projects, which resulted in industrial growth,” Jilani said.
However, the country cannot achieve its potential without the support of world powers with already-prominent economies like the United States. He stressed that America’s investment in Pakistan’s economy could reap benefits in Afghanistan — a country of primary U.S. interest. The economies of Afghanistan and Pakistan are very closely linked since they engage in more than $2 billion worth of trade.
“A sound economic base in Pakistan would also have a very positive effect on the economy of Afghanistan, and in turn would bring about stability, which has been the long term objective of the United States and other countries involved in Afghanistan,” Jilani said.
The ambassador also spoke about Pakistan’s strained relations with India, which resulted from territorial disputes over the region of Kashmir.
“Just as India has its issues related to terrorism, we also have our concerns to terrorism as far as India is concerned,” Jilani said.
However, Jilani is aware that establishing strong relations with Pakistan’s neighbors is a crucial step toward prosperity and success.
“The Prime Minister is convinced that unless there is peace and stability in the region, the economy certainly will not gain the same kind of momentum that the government wants,” he said. “With that the government has taken a number of initiatives with Afghanistan and India in order to improve our relations and also in order to improve the overall security.”
This outlook seemed rather optimistic to Stanley Kober (SFS ’73), who attended  Tuesday’s lunch.
“He’s being very diplomatic. … I’m not so sure about the economy and the terrorism,” he said.
During the latter half of the event, which was open to questions, several queries centered on the region’s military state of affairs. Despite concerns about Pakistan’s involvement with bin Laden, the ambassador stated that the two countries are currently cooperating on intelligence operations.
The ambassador concluded the event by reflecting upon his goals as ambassador to the United States. He hopes to build a very strong relationship between the two countries. Professor Christine Fair, whose research concerns political and military affairs in South Asia, found Jilani’s remarks trite: She felt that he avoided the accusations that were levied against his country.
“Personally, I found the Ambassador’s talk to be a staged rehearsal of well-worn talking points and it included a regrettable amount of dissembling on key issues such as Pakistan’s support for  Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Taliban and so forth,” Fair wrote in an email. “It was clear from his talk that the talking points of the civilian government and the Pakistan military and intelligence agencies are isomorphic, unfortunately.”

DANIEL SMITH/THE HOYAOmika Jikaria (SFS ’14) is the only woman on a GUSA ticket.While over 54 percent of Georgetown students are female and less than half of the student body identifies itself as white, only one out of eight candidates running for Georgetown University Student Association executive office this year is female, and only two identify as members of minority ethnic groups.
The absence of diversity among the tickets drew criticism from some candidates and student groups, who allege that the electoral field does not accurately represent the student body.
Six of the candidates, Ben Weiss (COL ’15), Sam Greco (SFS ’15), Zach Singer (SFS ’15), Dan Silkman (COL ’15), Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Thomas Lloyd (SFS ’15) identify as white males, while Lloyd’s running mate, Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15), is a Latino male. Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15), the only female in the race, is of Indian descent. Both Ramirez and Jikaria are running for vice president.
Although Jikaria is often reminded of her status as the only female in the candidate field, she maintains that this fact is relatively unimportant compared to other campaign issues.
“It’s definitely something I’m aware of going into the race, and people always bring it up,” Jikaria said. “But I think that the conversation about the issues is much more important than how many girls are running.”
She noted, however, that the lack of female candidates in this year’s GUSA executive contest appears indicative of a larger trend in American political culture.
“I think it’s sad that there’s only one girl running. I think that there definitely is a dearth of women leaders in student government positions in general in America,” Jikaria said. “I don’t necessarily have a solution for that. I think that it’s just important for young girls to see other women running, and that will inspire them.”
Tezel, Jikaria’s running mate, expressed disappointment that GUSA leadership failed to adequately represent the diversity characteristic of the student body.
“I think it’s always important that we see GUSA races that actually represent the student body, and part of that is, both from a racial and ethnic as well as gender side, it is important that we continue to have a diverse group run for GUSA,” Tezel said. “If we’re not continually looking at how we’re engaging with all the faces of Georgetown, then that’s something we’ll start to lose in a body that’s supposed to be representative of the whole student body.”
Lloyd, the race’s only openly gay candidate and the president of GU Pride, expressed similar frustration and described the difficult choice many students face regarding the decision to participate in activism for particular groups or causes, rather than becoming involved in student government.
“GUSA has had problems with gender for a very long time, and race and sexual orientation,” Lloyd said. “I think at Georgetown, it’s very difficult to be involved in an affinity group or an advocacy group and be involved in GUSA. I’ve never been involved because I’ve dedicated a lot of my time to Pride, and that’s meant burning some bridges with some administrators, that’s meant engaging in those tough conversations that maybe I don’t want to do if I have to get elected.”
Though neither Weiss and Greco’s ticket nor Singer and Silkman’s ticket include any women or members of minority groups, both teams stressed a dedication to fostering diversity on campus.
“Unfortunately, two individuals can never possibly represent the entire campus community,” Weiss and Greco wrote in a statement. “It has been crucial for us to hear every perspective, speaking with students of all different backgrounds in order to develop a platform and strategy that will best serve the entirety of Georgetown.”
Weiss and Greco’s statement additionally stressed input they received from campus groups such as the Women’s Center, the Georgetown chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Sexual Assault Peer Educators program in the development of their platform. However, they maintained the lack of diversity on their ticket was not a disadvantage.
“We will not, however, reduce our staff and supporters to minority tokenism,” the statement said.
Singer and Silkman similarly noted that, while women and minority groups are not represented on their ticket, these groups nevertheless maintain a significant presence in their staff and supporters.
“One of the top reasons Dan and I are running is because we know how to break down barriers and bring people together,” Singer and Silkman wrote in a statement. “That spirit is reflected in our campaign team, a group of men and women of diverse backgrounds who bring a wealth of unique experiences to our campaign.”
Last year’s election featured two female candidates for GUSA executive office, Shavonnia Corbin Johnson (SFS ’14), who ran for president, and Maggie Cleary (COL ’14), who ran for vice president. While both of their teams ultimately lost to current executives Nate Tisa (SFS ’14) and Adam Ramadan (SFS ’14), Cleary and running mate Jack Appelbuam (COL ’14) came in a close second.
“I’m disappointed to see that just one of the eight GUSA executive tickets this year has a female candidate,” Cleary said. “That being said, this is not particularly unusual within Georgetown or within our country as a whole.”
According to Cleary, women may be hesitant to run due to concerns about qualifications.
“The reason we don’t have more women on tickets is not because more women aren’t qualified, but instead because they don’t believe themselves to be qualified,” Cleary added.
In 2012, however, the winning ticket featured two women, Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) and Vail Kohnert-Yount (SFS ’13). During that election, five of the seven tickets included at least one female candidate, and two featured openly gay students.
Kohnert-Yount expressed a desire for an increasingly diverse field but stressed the necessity that all candidates seek to represent minority groups.
“I would of course love to see more female candidates, just as I would love to see more candidates with disabilities or transgender candidates or candidates who identify as working class or first-generation college students,” Kohnert-Yount said. “But I think less important than a candidate’s identity is their commitment to serve all the students of Georgetown across the spectrum of gender identity, sexual orientation, racial and ethnic identity, socioeconomic status, ability and so forth.”
Of this year’s batch of candidates, four have experience in the GUSA senate. Eleven of the 27 current GUSA senators are female.
Chandini Jha (COL ’16), a deputy chief of staff and a former senator, coordinated Elect Her, a conference to encourage women to run for student government office, in September, after Cleary ran an iteration last April.
Jha said she does not believe the GUSA executive is institutionally male dominated.
“I don’t think the issue is the institution, but rather the way the institution has been in the past, in the sense that a lot of people see GUSA as something that is kind of male-dominated, and especially looking at the hard numbers in the Senate, we’ve always struggled to increase women’s representation because they’re a very underrepresented community in the senate,” she said.
Alyssa Peterson (COL ’14), also a deputy chief of staff, said the absence of women on this year’s executive tickets reflects the candidates’ priorities.
“You have a case where you have all-male heads of the ticket, but you’re making policy choices when you select your VP,” Peterson said. “When you pick a man, obviously there are a variety of factors why VPs are chosen, but when you do reach out to a man, you show that reaching out to females and representing us as a group isn’t necessarily one of your top priorities.”
The problem may also lie in how GUSA is perceived.
“My freshman year, GUSA was described to me as an old boys’ club, and just those words made it seem like an institution that was almost difficult to get into to and that mentality really needs to change. In order to have a student association that’s really representative of your student body, you need to have more females involved,” GUSA Director of Student Advocacy Office Michelle Mohr (COL ’15) said.
The idea of GUSA as a “boys’ club” can also lead to speculation about the women who do participate.
“I think that mindset also leads to the thinking that women who are involved are more cutthroat or of a very aggressive nature, which is often a characteristic given to women who are in leadership roles, that somehow they’re more aggressive than the standard female, if there is such a thing,” GUSA Freshman Outreach Coordinator Makaiah Mohler (COL ’16) said.
Nonetheless, Mohr said she does not feel like a victim of prejudice on the basis of her gender.
“The current cabinet does have more males than females, but there is a great sense of respect within the cabinet. I haven’t felt slighted at all by the fact that I am a female, and I think it speaks very highly to the individuals who are in the cabinet,” Mohr said.
Ultimately, some candidates expressed frustration at being categorized based solely on their gender or other characteristics. Ramirez, running with Lloyd, noted that although his is an all-male ticket, it nevertheless represents many other forms of diversity.
“I’m frustrated that, because we’re both males, we’re typecast,” Ramirez said. “I’m proud to be part of a ticket that includes Thomas Lloyd, and I’m proud to have the vantage point that I have, but I’m not proud that there is one woman running in the race.”

Over spring break, four Georgetown University undergraduates and one graduate student will take part in the Atlantic Hope humanitarian disaster simulation in conjunction with the Jesuit University Humanitarian Action Network in Fort Pierce, Fla.
The simulation, which will occur from March 6 through 9 at the Public Safety Training Complex of Indian River State College, provides a hands-on field training experience that models what it is like for responders aiding a crisis zone. The program uses the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program.
In order to find interested students, former simulation participant and Atlantic Hope Staff Development Officer Ariana Tuchman (GRD ’15) approached JUHAN on campus.
Mary Oeftering (SFS ’14), Sophia Berhie (SFS ’14), Taylor Griffin (COL ’14) and Zoe Mowl (SFS ’15) are the four undergraduate JUHAN fellows who will be participating. JUHAN is an initiative through the Center for Social Justice and the Institute for the Study of International Migration that works on improving the education of humanitarian issues and awareness.
“We also coordinate response on campus to humanitarian crises,” Oeftering said. “When the disaster in the Philippines happened last semester, we helped coordinate all of the different offices and clubs that would want to raise money so that we could make one big donation as a university. This is so people are not doubling their efforts where work has already been made.”
Participants will take on the role of aid workers operating in Atlantica, a fictional country modelled after many past conflict zones.
“Atlantica has evolved over the years. It used to be somewhat of a post-Soviet Union state. After the Haitian Earthquake, we worked in pieces simulating it. Now it is kind of taking a Syria tone. It is fictional enough where people cannot always know what they are responding to,” Tuchman said.
Overall, the simulation will involve 39 undergraduates from different areas of the country.
“We have students [who] come in with a variety of backgrounds. Some are nursing students [who] want to work in hospitals in the U.S. and for them it is a good experience to learn how to deal with high-stress environments. Some people are political science students who want to join the Peace Corps. We also have nontraditional students who may be in their 30s and 40s who come,” Tuchman said.
The focus on the leadership part of the program ensures that participants are in control of the situations. The staff members act as controllers and evaluators, but do not directly participate in the program. Their role is to make sure that the participants stay safe and that they are completing the learning objectives.
Many past participants of the program have gone on to aid in humanitarian efforts around the world. One former participant is working in Mali with the World Food Program and another is currently completing conflict resolution work in South Sudan.
“After I participated, I worked in Kenya at an internally displaced persons camp over the summer. It definitely was not nearly as intense as Atlantica,” Tuchman said.“There were a few minor emergencies or potential things that could have happened while in Kenya. I just feel like I had a much better reaction, as I was able to take a deep breath and gain some situational understanding.”
Both the participants anticipate personal growth from the coming experience.
“I am hoping that this simulation will help me determine if I am cut out for humanitarian work. I am definitely nervous — I think it is more that I don’t know what will happen. I think they are intentionally vague so that we aren’t prepared for everything that happens because you are not prepared for everything in a crisis,” Oeftering said.
Participants additionally look forward to the practical insight that the simulation will offer.
“I think the simulation will take me out of my comfort zone, which will be incredibly challenging but also [will be] a growing experience for me. It will give me insight into the structural and practical difficulties [that] humanitarian workers face on the ground. It’s an incredible opportunity to apply the theories and practices I learn about in the classroom to a real, simulated event,” Berhie said.

World-renowned photographer and photojournalist Steve McCurry, spoke to students as part of the Lecture Fund’s Arts and Politics Lecture Series in the ICC Auditorium on Wednesday. The event was jointly sponsored by the Lecture Fund, the Office of the Provost, the Center for Social Impact Communication, the Center for Social Justice, Georgetown University Art Aficionados, Asian Studies Department, Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship and the South Asian Society. Michelle Yaw (COL ’15), a Lecture Fund member, introduced McCurry, giving a brief overview of his life and work.
Before the presentation, McCurry held discussion and photography workshops for students who had applied ahead of time. McCurry also sold posters and postcards after his presentation, the proceeds of which went to Imagine Asia, his non-profit that helps provide health and education services to children in Afghanistan.
McCurry is perhaps most famous for his December 1984 National Geographic cover of a young Afghan girl with striking green eyes, in a torn shawl. “
“His work spans political conflict, social issues, cultural diversity, but at the same time the photos retain a very powerful human quality that touches so many people around the world,” Yaw said in her introduction of McCurry.
McCurry first showed a short video featuring some of his photos, as well as a list of his maxims. According to McCurry, passion is what drove him to be a photographer, and his favorite photos are those he is most passionate about.
“One of the most important points that I should remind myself of when doing a story is to look for situations that I passionately care about,” McCurry said. “At the end of the day, the pictures that I care about and that are interesting are pictures of stories that I thought very deeply about.”
He also stressed the importance of being part of the conversation, or using his photos to create change. McCurry spoke specifically about his experience during the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
“Through filmmaking and photography, I thought, this is something I can do with my life;,travel, photograph, document and tell stories around the world,” McCurry said. “Take Sept. 11 as an example. I was in New York and realized this situation is something that we want to remember and is going to be a landmark of world history, and this was something that absolutely I felt I had to be a part of.”
McCurry then showed the audience a selection of his photos in detail, telling short anecdotes about each. He spoke of his travels to countries including India, Burma, Cuba and Afghanistan. One particular anecdote dealt with his most famous picture, “The Afghan Girl.” The photo, which was on the cover of National Geographic, soon became an international phenomenon, and was renamed the “Afghan Mona Lisa.”
“I saw her and she was a little bit shy and reluctantly photographed. … She dropped her hands and I shifted my camera a little bit to the left and I got this picture, which is sort of a once-in-a-lifetime picture,” McCurry said. “The background was perfect and the light was right, and the expression and emotional component were there. There’s a rip in her shawl, and she’s really pretty, but you can see that she’s poor and her face is a bit dirty.”
Karen Zhang (COL ’17), an attendee of the event, enjoyed McCurry’s humor throughout his explanation of his collection.
“I thought it was a very entertaining presentation, and it was refreshing to see how optimistic and humorously he viewed all these major world events and cultural customs,” Zhang said. “I thought he was a very genuine person because he didn’t hesitate to admit that maybe there wasn’t an epic significance of certain photos, but just that something or someone caught his eye and he just wanted a picture of it.”

With the recent spate of network phishing attacks, where hackers have attempted to gain information, the university has instituted a mandatory biannual password change for students, faculty and staff during both the fall and spring semesters.
University Information Services sent out the first batch of emails to students who have not changed their password in the last six months — students who changed their password within the last month are exempted — but found that 1,300 have failed to change their passwords. This figure represents about half the students notified.
If students fail to change their passwords by the date specified in their targeted email, they will be locked out of the system and be required to call the service center in order to go through the password change process and regain access to the network. UIS has already postponed their additional deadline, because of spring break.
“We’re looking at about 31,000 student IDs, and if you take that 50 percent number, that’s a lot of people. We don’t want that many people getting cut off. We don’t even want half that many people getting cut off,” Associate University Information Security Officer Judith House said. “We’ve worked the dates around so that no one will be cut off during pre-registration and no one will be cut off during exams, but in that window in between, everybody is either going to have to comply or be cut off.”
In order to ward against attacks, Georgetown uses a defense and depth system, which uses layers of defense to ward off hackers. The university gets around 2.4 million attacks a month on the system. Normally attacks come in the form of false log-ins or malware links that network users click on, allowing a false network to gain their information.
“In a very real sense, the human is the weak link. … If you have a weak password that’s easy for them to guess, if you accidentally click on a link that has malware attached to it, that kind of thing, is a door into the institution,” House said.
Recently, other schools, including University of Maryland, Indiana University, Johns Hopkins University and the University of North Dakota, suffered data breaches. University of Maryland’s system especially suffered, as attackers were able to gain personal information of around 300,000 students, including social security numbers.
For some students, the emails about phishing attacks have proven confusing, as they are unsure how exactly to change their passwords and what to look out for.
“I also think that the university doesn’t really do a good job differentiating what’s real and what’s not because they’ll say, ‘Did you get this email? That was fake, don’t do it,’ and I never really know which one is which,” Claudia Huang (COL ’17) said.
Huang noted that she had not changed her password, and was not aware that students are required to do so and that students would benefit from a Blackboard alert directing a password change.
Thu Dao (NHS ’17), who also had not changed her password, did not feel particularly concerned about the phishing attacks.
“I think I should be, but because I haven’t been personally affected by it, I don’t think I’m that concerned,” Dao said.
In order to cause more concern, some students believe the university should more directly and clearly communicate with students about the status of attacks.
“I think they could make it more clear in how they explain what the risks are to students and just the way that students can protect themselves,” Evan Chernack (SFS ’17) said. “If that’s something Georgetown wants to do, it needs to be accompanied by them raising a lot of awareness.”

With the spring return of the Georgetown University Farmers Market to Copley Lawn, students will notice new vendors as well as the absence of Indigo, the popular Indian food stand, on Wednesdays.
This year’s new vendors include Hilltoss — the new Students of Georgetown Inc. salad location — Lulu’s Ice Cream, Rita’s Crepes and a new pickle vendor called Fresh Crunch. This introduction of different food stands is an attempt to vary the vendors based on the change of season while continuing to cater to student preferences.
“We have our vendors try to rotate in and out just to keep consistency but also to get a diverse variety of offerings throughout the market season,” Farmers Market Director Lexi Cotcamp (MSB ’15) said.
Director of Hilltoss Dana Mitchell (MSB ’15) was pleased with the student-run stand’s first day at the farmers market.
While Hilltoss is new to the scene, Indigo — a student favorite — will not return to the farmers market.
“I believe Indigo won’t be back this season just because they recently opened a new restaurant near Union Station and so they are actually focusing on that this semester,” Cotcamp said.
Cotcamp partly attributed the new food selections to vendor availability.
“There is no specific reason as to why a certain vendor would be included over another other than the fact that certain factors would prevent a vendor from being able to come, such as opening a restaurant, or growing or time constraints,” Cotcamp said.
The products that are sold at the farmers market, especially in the produce section, vary according to the weather. Peach season occurs toward the beginning of the academic year, while apples are most abundant during the fall and winter vegetables are plentiful during this time of year.
“Our product offerings tend to be very much dedicated to the different seasons,” Cotcamp said. “Mother Nature really tends to figure out how our product offerings will go, depending on if there is a late freeze or an early start to spring.”
The weather is especially impactful on the weekly market because of its focus on local products. All produce comes from the D.C. area, a standard which is enforced by Georgetown Farmers Market leadership.
“In order to actually come to the market, vendors must sign a contract, which essentially binds them to only bring to the market produce that is sourced locally, which is defined as being within I believe [a] 200-mile … radius,” Cotcamp said.
Besides the climate’s effect on product offerings, weather also affects whether the market can function at all. However, despite recent storms, Cotcamp said that weather wouldn’t prevent the stands from opening for business.
“Of course, if there is any sort of emergency condition where the university is closed, then we would have to reconsider, but for the most part, we tend to operate rain or shine,” Cotcamp said.
Because the market’s opening day was plagued with wind, rain and mud, some vendors were concerned with weather issues.
“Weather is 50 percent of our sales, one way or another. If it’s bad weather, it’s going to be less than half [of our normal sales],” Fresh Crunch founder Matt Bressan said.
As students quickly moved from stand to stand to avoid the rain, some said that the bad weather would limit their time at the market. However, they said they would continue coming in future weeks.
“I probably won’t stay around as long if the weather continues, but as long as I have an umbrella, I’m good and I’ll show up,” Angela Ribaudo (SFS ’17) said.
The products themselves continue to draw Erika Bullock (COL ’17) despite weather concerns.
“[The weather] is a little bit of an impediment, but I just love the fresh produce so much that it doesn’t affect me personally too much,” Bullock said.
Even with weather concerns, vendors are happy to return to campus.
“I love this market. The students and the faculty and the staff love our stuff. We’re really happy to be back,” said Chris Girardot, who is in charge of running the Upper Crust Bakery stand.

Just as the university wrapped up its first GAAP Weekend for students through accepted early action Sunday, 2,277 high school seniors began receiving word of their regular decision admission to the Class of 2018.
Out of 19,501 total applicants, 2,277 were accepted through regular decision. The overall admission rate in the combined early and regular decision cycles was 16.6 percent, slightly lower than last year’s 17 percent for the Class of 2017.
The McDonough School of Business was once again the most selective school with an acceptance rate of 16 percent, slightly higher than last year’s rate of 15.7 percent.
“There has been more growth in the MSB than other schools, and partly that is because of job opportunities,” Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) said. “The yield is pushing up towards 60 percent in the MSB. Perhaps the MSB pool is a little more self-selective and less dependent on financial aid, so people have the ability to say yes more easily.”
Georgetown College admitted 16.4 percent of applicants, slightly higher than 2013’s 16.3 percent acceptance rate. Both the School of Nursing and Health Studies and the Walsh School of Foreign Service admitted 17.5 percent of applicants, slightly lower than last year’s rate of 17.7 percent for the NHS and 18.7 percent for the SFS .
The number of first-generation college students leveled at 12 percent, the same as last year, a number which, according to Deacon, is consistent with national trends.
“Colleges are recruiting harder in that population to bring more equity, and there is a lot more attention given to it. Kids in first-generation backgrounds are beginning to believe they have that chance,” Deacon said. “We have some pretty good partnerships with scholarships and that helps us get students in the pool that might not otherwise apply to Georgetown.”
Additionally, the accepted class is 56 percent female, two points lower than the national average of 58 percent female.
California and New York were again the two most represented states in the admitted class, with 391 and 382 students, respectively. New Jersey had the next largest representation with 259 admitted students.
Although Georgetown admitted students from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and 64 countries, the percent of international students, at 8.5 percent, saw a nearly three-point decrease from last year’s pool. The majority of international applicants came from South Korea, China and the United Kingdom, respectively.
Deacon attributed this decrease in admitted international students to the total decrease in international applicants, down 10 percent from last year.
“We may have hit a ceiling, or at least a pause, in this growth of international applicants. It could be the law of averages catching up to us,” Deacon said. “Our staff is going to India in the next couple of weeks, and that we see as an area to grow more in terms of applicants.”
The acceptance rate for minority students increased 0.6 percent from last year’s record number of 39 percent to 39.6 percent. Within individual minority groups, there was a 4-point bump from 2013 in the number of accepted students who self-identified as Asian-American, from 13 to 17.3 percent. Ten percent of admitted students identified as African-American, a slight increase from last year’s accepted class of 9 percent, while almost 12 percent of accepted students identified as Hispanic, up slightly from 11 percent. At 7 percent, the rate of students identifying with multiple ethnicities remained the same as last year.
Georgetown still distinguishes itself from peer universities by remaining separate from the Common Application and requiring an alumni interview. According to Deacon, the separate application process results in fewer applicants every year and consequently a higher acceptance rate compared to peer institutions such as University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College and Emory University, which had admit rates of 12.3, 10.4 and 26.5 percent, respectively, according to their websites.
Accepted Georgetown student Sian Rigby praised the university’s separate, unique application.
“I enjoyed the personal ‘Georgetown touch’ apparent in the application. Georgetown has been my dream school since middle school, and I felt I could demonstrate that sentiment more effectively with the Georgetown application than I would have been able to through the Common App,” Rigby wrote.
According to Deacon, Georgetown offered 2,123 students spots on the waitlist this year and expects to accept around 50 waitlisted students in May after deposits have been sent for a target class size of no more than 1,580 students, in accordance with the 2010 Campus Plan Agreement’s cap of 6,675 undergraduates.
Over the next few weeks, the university will push to woo accepted students through alumni-sponsored receptions across the country and the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program events running throughout the month of April leading up to the May 1 decision date. Last year, 47.4 percent of accepted students in the Class of 2017 enrolled in Georgetown.
With one GAAP weekend already held, some prospective students already find themselves attached to the Hilltop.
“GAAP weekend was incredible. I already loved Georgetown, but GAAP weekend convinced me that extra little bit I needed that it would be worth it to fly all the way across the country to come here. It was the most well-organized, well-planned open house I’ve been to, and I enjoyed it thoroughly,” said Aislinn McNiece, an accepted senior from Lafayette, Calif.

Georgetown University Debate Team captains Andrew Markoff (SFS ’14) and Andrew Arsht (COL ’14) won their second national debate championship title at the University of Indiana Bloomington on April 1.
After a long tournament that began on March 28, Markoff and Arsht were notified of their win at 2:30 a.m.
“The first person I see is [Arsht] and just the smile on his face, and then all of our teammates were gathered there right behind us, kind of tackle us, and everyone is celebrating,” Markoff said. “It’s just euphoria because of just how hard we’ve worked and how much it takes to get to that point.”
Coach Jonathan Paul also expressed pride in the win.
“I was just completely elated. I was proud of everyone on the team and coaching staff that worked so hard. I was just immensely excited for [them] that they were able to win their last debate and leave the debate team and Georgetown on top,” Paul said.
To qualify for one of the tournament’s 80 spots, a partnership had to be ranked in the national top 16 teams, win regional debates or be directly offered a spot. In addition to Markoff and Arsht, the pair of Andy McCoy (SFS ’16) and Tyler Engler (SFS ’15) also qualified. Markoff and Arsht are ranked third in the nation, while McCoy and Engler are ranked 12th. Going into the tournament, Georgetown overall ranked as the 10th best team.
This year’s National Debate Tournament topic was the reduction of presidential powers. The debaters said that this year’s topic proved especially difficult because of its contentious legal nature.
“The core question of the topic was about legal authority, but the vast majority of the literature wasn’t really about who has control over something like drone strikes — legally. It was more just ‘Are drone strikes good or bad,’” McCoy said. “It was really challenging, but it was good to force a very technical debate over a tough legal issue.”
Markoff and Arsht also won the championship title in 2012; together, the pair holds more championships than all but eight out of the 286 schools that attended the National Debate Tournament. Despite their previous win, however, Markoff and Arsht placed third in last year’s tournament.
“They won a national championship as sophomores, and it happened so fast and was so surreal — it was such a fairytale — that we kind of walked away with it with this unnatural understanding of how hard it was,” Assistant Coach Seth Gannon said. “Last year, they were even better at debate, and they were working so hard and yet didn’t win.”
According to Paul, Markoff and Arsht’s hard work, recruitment and mentorship strengthened the team to its current position as one of the nation’s top debate teams.
“They set the tone for other people on the team with their hard work, their preparation, and we had a great deal of success their first year,” Paul said. “It helped us a lot with recruiting good high school debaters to come to Georgetown and debate.”
Gannon agreed and praised their teamwork.
“They are a finely tuned machine. They kind of read one another’s minds, [and] they work together hardly having to talk,” Gannon said.

Monday marked the first day of the 2014 Indian general election, which will span a record 36 days, culminating May 12. Voting will take place in all 543 constituency districts of India to elect members of parliament in the Lok Sabha, which will determine the new prime minister. Students are raising awareness for the election, which may have serious repercussions for Asia and the world.
On April 3, the government department paired with the Georgetown South Asian Society to sponsor the event, “Indian Elections 2014: An Interactive Panel Discussion” at the Mortara Center. Government professor Matthew Rudolph moderated the event, which featured presentations by associate for the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Milan Vaishnav, former U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh Howard Schaffer and Indian political author, journalist and visiting scholar at Johns Hopkins University Kota Neelima.
“I hope that this is part of a wave where we see more student and university interest and effort in India. China always gets the limelight when we refer to Asia, and I for one and students supporting this event would like to see some balance,” Rudolph said.
The focus of the event was to discuss the electoral prospects of the main political parties, and to determine what the results could mean for India’s relationship with the United States. There are two frontrunners for the position of prime minister: Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi.
Gandhi’s incumbent Congress Party, supported by the poorest factions of Indian society, focuses on welfare initiatives and increased socioeconomic mobility. Gandhi himself is the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has dominated Indian politics since independence. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party runs on a platform of good governance and economic development, hoping to expose the alleged corruption and wastefulness of the Congress Party and current Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s coalition government.
The BJP is favored in the election, as Vaishnav explained that Indians care most about economic development and corruption.
“When the Indian voter is asked, the single most important thing is the economy. Number two is corruption, and number three is inflation,” Vaishnav said. “Because the Congress hasn’t performed well on these issues, the BJP have attacked the incumbents on these core tenants and have focused their platform on these issues.”
Although the BJP are expected to win the most seats of any party in the Lok Sabha and lead a coalition government, the many regional parties whose major voting bases consist of lower-caste, working-class Hindus and Muslims will ensure that a variety of parties hold a sizable presence in the parliament. It will be up to the BJP to convince some of these crucial smaller parties to join them in order to cross the 272-seat mark and effectively form a majority functioning coalition in the Lok Sabha.
Vaishnav explained the collaboration between various parties in terms of political and security motivations.
“In the case of Tamil Nadu, a southern state, political leaders entering the coalition would want the major party to let the foreign policy dealing with Sri Lanka, which has an ethnic Tamil majority, fall to their state,” Vaishnav said.
All three panel experts predicted that Modi will win the election — what this will mean for U.S.-Indian relations is up for debate.
“Modi’s party will want good relations with the United States, as most Indian leaders have in the past. However, in the past six months, relations have soured a bit due to the arrest of Indian Consular Officer Devyani Khobragade in New York City on charges of visa fraud and making false statements to the U.S. State Department about her work,” Schaffer said.
Despite this scandal, the relationship between the two major powers looks to remain a strong and vital partnership for years to come.
Luis Joy Pérez (SFS ’17), one of the approximately 40 students in attendance, came away from the panel discussion with a better understanding of the Indian political system.
“I am now able to better comprehend the issues of India’s election and why the media has been portraying Narendra Modi as the heir-apparent for New Delhi,” Pérez said.
SAS Marketing Chair Mariam Matin (COL ’15) was happy to see that students were developing an interest in foreign electoral races.
“It was exciting to see the room filled with a combination of people both directly invested in the elections and people who were just curious to learn more. I think people got a good idea of some of the key trends at play for this election,” Matin said.
Yash Johri (SFS ’17) from Delhi, India, is a research assistant under Rudolph, and helped arrange the event. He agreed with the panel’s conclusions.
“I think that it will be a coalition government because I don’t think that any party will attain a majority. Modi’s party has captured the imagination of the youth interested in the main issues. What he’s focused on is economic development and not the regional or religious issues,” Johri said. “This election is more about the shortcomings of the incumbent party. The rampant corruption and mismanagement of the past five years is the main talking point for Modi and the reason why he will win.”
He hopes that the panel will create greater interest in India from the Georgetown community.
“This event is the beginning of a larger effort to bring India to Georgetown and to the D.C. community in particular. While I see an immense amount of emphasis laid upon studying China as the next great hegemon, having been in Washington for over eight months I have sensed that India’s presence isn’t really felt, and I feel it is important to educate the community on India’s importance in the world,” Johri said.

The Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, the official publication of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, is launching a new website at the end of this month, with hopes of extending its brand in the academic community.
“The goal is to facilitate academic community because we have so many different authors and so many different pieces coming out,” Co-Online GJIA Editor-in-Chief Catie Burleson (SFS ’15) said. “We wanted to have the functionality of really creating a web community.”
New features include specific webpages for authors and easier maneuverability through articles. From Jan. 1 to Nov. 13, 2013 the website received 91,969 visits and 157,057 page views.
“I think it will definitely enhance our online edition,” Co-Online GJIA Editor-in-Chief Daye Shim Lee said (SFS ’14). “Georgetown Journal online started out as a small blog with staff writers contributing to it but now it has become a more legitimate online publication, featuring really prominent experts in the field of IR.”
With four years of experience working at the journal, Lee became GJIA’s online Editor-in-Chief this past year. According to Lee, who came from the print journal, a large learning curve was involved with online.
“I learned a lot about how fast-paced the online publications are and what we need to do to survive in that area of publication,” Lee said.
The print version of GJIA is published biannually, while the online version includes anywhere from two to five new articles every week, with funds for the journal coming directly from the SFS Dean’s Office.
“We are looking to build more bridges between print and online and we definitely use online to feature the print content,” Burleson said. “With online, we have different columns that focus on different themes that are always turning over.”
While scholars and experts in a particular field mainly write the articles that are published in the journal, students play a main role in editing and reviewing.
“The journal is actually really interesting because it’s probably the only organization on campus that I know of that actually has a hybrid staff that is comprised of undergrads, graduate students and actually Ph.D. candidates as well,” GJIA Executive Director William Handel (SFS’ 14) said. “When you work on the staff, you really get exposed to people that are at all different points in their career track at all different levels of experience.”
Due to GJIA’s spread of international topics, it is written for a readership that largely includes readers outside of the Georgetown community.
“The journal’s readership is mostly an amalgamation of government, business leaders, policymakers, think-tankers and major institutions around the world,” Handel said. “We would love for more of our readership to come from students, especially Georgetown students, but it’s notoriously difficult for us to retain their attention for a long period of time and that’s something we always struggled with.”
The readership for the journal is mainly in the Washington, D.C. proper area and the international community, among which the United Kingdom, India, Canada and Australia rank most prominently.
“We are looking for scholars, for experts with a very good understanding of what goes into their industry and their field,” GJIA Undergraduate Editor-in-Chief Medha Raj (SFS ’14) said. “We know who our readership is and we try to cater to that readership.”
Student readership at Georgetown has been a continual issue for the journal. Although GJIA is internationally known, students seem to turn to other publications on campus.
“Georgetown students are very busy and everyone has work they need to do for class,” Handel said. “There are so many publications out there that, if a Georgetown student only has a limited number of hours in a day to read stuff, they probably won’t turn to us first.”
Nevertheless, GJIAhas also made great strides in recent years. With many of the Georgetown students at the journal having worked there for multiple years, they have seen tremendous growth.
“I think it definitely grew a lot in terms of substance, but I think what we do need to continue to work on increasing our presence in the Georgetown community,” Lee said.  “We are very well-known and respected in D.C. and elsewhere and we have global readership, but here at Georgetown, I don’t think as many people know what we do.”
One way that the journal tries to reach out to readers in the Georgetown and greater D.C. area is by holding events.
Choosing themes for the different issues is another important aspect the journal must consider when constructing their print issue.
“We look at what is most current and get a variety of perspectives,” Raj said. “Myself and Warren Ryan (GRD ’14), the graduate editor-in-chief, go through topics and decide what we think is most fitting, not just in terms of timing, but also in terms of what is more cutting edge and what other journals aren’t necessarily writing about.”
As a student organization, the journal is highly dependent on its undergraduate and graduate staff to continue to build the publication and help it grow in the future.
“It’s so dependent on the talent here and the level of commitment that they can put into it and the ownership they take,” Burleson said. “We have seen a lot of ownership being taken and the team really being built and we hope that continues in the future and expands to be broader than just our staff.”

Recent Alumna
Ten weeks after her graduation from Georgetown, Bess Rosenzweig (COL ’13) died in a plane crash in Kenya on July 25 that also claimed the lives of her mother and the plane’s pilot. According to friends, the psychology major with a minor in French and a certificate in African studies epitomized the concept of a free spirit. An avid traveller, Rosenzweig, who was 22, relished the opportunity to explore different cultures — she had a particular affinity for the African continent — and connect with strangers and friends alike. She spent time volunteering as a teacher outside Nairobi, Kenya, and had climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.
 
Professor
Professor Wayne Knoll died Nov. 10, 2013, after a three-month battle with an incurable and inoperable cancerous tumor. The former Jesuit priest joined the Georgetown faculty in 1972, teaching English for 41 years. Knoll was renowned for his capacity for love, whether in regard to his students, which included University President John J. DeGioia, the university or his wife. He received the Edward B. Bunn Award for excellence in teaching in 2006.
 
 
Former Mascot
The pioneer of Georgetown’s costumed mascot tradition, Patrick Sheehan (CAS ’81), was killed in a car crash in the Bronx, N.Y., on Nov. 9. Sheehan donned the first Jack the Bulldog suit in 1977, his freshman year, after an Alumni Association group chose him because of his enthusiasm and personality. His tenure as mascot aligned with the heyday of Georgetown men’s basketball, with the legendary coach John Thompson Jr.’s assumption of the helm in 1972. Sheehan was known for his antics during basketball games.
Sheehan, 54, was a managing director for public finance at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York. His son George attends Georgetown.
 
 
Alumnus and Boxing Trainer
Tom Quinn (CAS ’55) was a man of many titles: United States Marine, businessman, consultant, actor and Yates Field House employee. Yet one title has enshrined him in the pantheon of Georgetown legends: the 1955 NCAA Eastern heavyweight boxing champion. Quinn, who died Jan. 5 in Teaneck, N.J., at 79 from complications related to diabetes, was the university’s last title winner in boxing; his gloves hang in a case in McDonough Arena. After graduation, the Athletic Hall of Fame member held a variety of successful careers before pursuing acting, with parts in “Enemy of the State” and “The Wire,” in addition to his work in D.C. theater. He was hired as a boxing trainer at Yates in 2004, and was recognized by students as a friendly employee GOCards at the gym’s front desk.
 
 
Professor
Former professor and economist Adhip Chaudhuri, who retired last year, died Jan. 13 after a three-year battle with lung cancer. Chaudhuri, who was born in India and immigrated to the United States in 1972, taught international economics at Georgetown in both D.C. and Doha, Qatar, for 34 years, twice winning professor of the year. Chaudhuri encouraged students to incorporate social justice into all aspects of their Georgetown education. His children, Maya (SFS ’13) and Neal (COL ’16) Chaudhuri, followed their father to Georgetown, where they, too, participated in social justice programs.
Above all, Chaudhuri, at 62, remained devoted to knowledge and education.
“Right until the very end when he couldn’t stand up to teach, he would say to me, ‘I have to sit down and do this,’ but he did it because he loved doing it,” Chaudhuri’s friend Amit Shah said.
 
Student
Mark Adamsson (SFS ’15) died from lung and heart failure attributed to medical reasons in the Dominican Republic during spring break this past March.
Adamsson, 22, a Swedish international student, was universally described as academically strong and curious. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., where he captained the varsity tennis team, which remained undefeated and won the Class A New England Championship his senior year.
“He was a very positive and optimistic person who would discover good and redeeming qualities in himself and also in others,” French professor Peter Janssens said.

After 13 years at the helm, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) has reached a milestone. The Georgetown fixture is now the longest-serving president in the university’s history, surpassing the 12- and 13-year tenures of former presidents Fr. Leo O’Donovan, S.J., and Fr. Timothy Healy, S.J.
But DeGioia says the real significance of the 2014-2015 academic year is not entering his 14th year in office, but the anniversary of his time as part of the Georgetown community. Forty years ago, Dean of Admissions Charles Deacon sent 18-year-old Jack his acceptance letter.
“I’ve been a part of this place, now, this will be the 40th year,” DeGioia said. “To this day I feel very blessed that I was invited into this community and given the opportunity to do the work I’ve been able to do here.”
DeGioia was named Georgetown’s 48th president in July 2001, after a career as a philosophy professor and senior administrator on campus. After graduating from Georgetown with a degree in English in 1979, he became a hall director in New South and has since served as an assistant to the president during Healy’s presidency, dean of student affairs, and senior vice president during O’Donovan’s time in the president’s office, negotiating the deal that sold the university’s hospital to MedStar while retaining its School of Medicine. He earned a doctorate in philosophy from the university in 1995.
“I’ve been in this office 13 years, and sometimes I still feel like it’s their office,” DeGioia said of his predecessors.
DeGioia is the first layperson to lead Georgetown, following 47 priests — mostly Jesuits — in the role.
For O’Donovan, Georgetown being led by a layman relates to the Second Vatican Council’s recognition of the importance of laypeople to the Catholic Church.
“I see the fact that Jack was elected president as a layman not only as reflective of his great quality, but also as the impetus of the council,” O’Donovan said.
“I think I would not have been able to serve long if I hadn’t been able to find ways for us to be the most authentically Catholic and Jesuit,” DeGioia said.
For much of Georgetown’s history, the lengths of its presidents’ tenures were limited by the position’s Jesuit link. The university president simultaneously served as rector of the Jesuit community, a position that one person can only hold for six years, until the two roles were separated in the 1960s.
Since then, university presidents have served around a decade. DeGioia began as president at 44 — a younger age than most of his predecessors.
“He acquired the experience and understanding of the university and its values at an early age and became president at a relatively early age, so it’s not surprising he has a career marked by longevity,” said Paul Tagliabue (CAS ’62), president of Georgetown’s board of directors.
“I was a little younger when I started. That was a little unusual,” DeGioia added. “I sort of joke, the old Indiana Jones line, ‘It ain’t the years, it’s the mileage.’ I’ve got some mileage on me.”
When DeGioia entered the president’s office in 2001, he was confronted with the university’s serious financial concerns and infrastructure needs. The first few years of his term were devoted to building new residence halls and academic construction, the university’s fundraising campaign and its commitments to faculty salary growth and need-blind financial aid, DeGioia said.
Since the mid-2000s, DeGioia has been able to focus on less immediate needs, including strengthening Georgetown’s global presence, involving extensive travel, launching the McCourt School of Public Policy and examining long-term approaches to academics.
“It’s almost been like two jobs for me,” DeGioia said. “The job I did from ’01 to ’05 and the job I’ve done since ’05.”
Now, DeGioia said, he thinks of Georgetown in terms of five elements: academic excellence, its home in Washington, its international character, its Catholic and Jesuit identity and its community.
Over the next year, DeGioia said, he’s looking forward to the university’s Designing the Future(s) programs, continuing to launch the McCourt School of Public Policy and finishing the Healey Family Student Center.
Beyond that, DeGioia said he will stay in his second-floor Healy Hall office “as long as it makes sense.”
“When I was a child, my dad was in the air force for a company that moved us a lot, and by the time I was 11, I had lived in 11 different places in three different states,” DeGioia said. “People often say, ‘How’d you stay at Georgetown all this time?’ If you’d moved 11 times by the time you were 11 years old, you might want to stay put for a while. But I know what it’s like to move, and when the day comes, if it makes sense, I’ll be ready to move.”

Georgetown will welcome its first Hindu chaplain, army captain and chaplain Pratima Dharm, in October. After Dharm retires from active duty, she will begin working part time with students, professors and the Office of Mission and Ministry.
Dharm currently serves as the first Hindu chaplain in the U.S. Army and has worked at army bases and hospitals around the world for eight years, including a yearlong deployment in Iraq. She is the head conflict resolution/resiliency and suicide prevention chaplain at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
Dharm will join Campus Ministry’s staff of Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, Orthodox and Protestant chaplains.
According to Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., a group of students and administrators helped select the new chaplain from a competitive pool.
“We’ve been looking for a Hindu chaplain for a couple of years now, and we’ve been talking with students about identifying a Hindu chaplain and the type of chaplain they want,” O’Brien said. “It was a competitive open search, but she was identified because of our contacts with the local Hindu community.”
The selection committee included three of the past presidents of the Hindu Student Association, including current president, Smiti Mohan (MSB ’15) and former president Ronak Parikh (MSB ’12). According to Mohan, the administration strongly valued student input during the decision-making process.
“We are the individuals with the most working knowledge about the process, the needs of the Hindu community and what the role of a Hindu chaplain would look like at Georgetown,” Mohan wrote in an email. “However, HSA boards have been discussing the hiring of a chaplain since my freshman year. It was very exciting and we were thrilled that Campus Ministry valued and placed such an emphasis on including our student feedback in their decision process.”
O’Brien said that Dharm is the best candidate for the job because of her multicultural and multi-religious background.
“She brings a unique mix of religious sensitivities to the position. She is a woman steeped in her own Hindu tradition, yet she has also been engaged deeply with other religious traditions, first as an Army chaplain, which serves all traditions,” O’Brien said. “She has had deep engagement with Christians and Muslims and Jews, so she brings a really unique set of experiences, which makes her sensitive to our interfaith engagement on campus.”
As a chaplain, Dharm will provide counseling, Hindu worship services and blessings to any member of the Georgetown community who seeks her guidance.
“[I will] help the students understand and be in touch with their faith traditions and their culture,” Dharm said.“The Indian culture and Hindu culture is very deep and very ancient, and to be able to have some continuity, even on a campus, is very important.”
Dharm said that her experience with young people in the army has prepared her well for helping students with the stresses they face on college campuses.
“On active duty, the actual population that we take care of and administer to are the young soldiers. The issues are pretty much the same,” Dharm said.“There are issues of identity that we deal with and issues of suicide, which is very rampant in the Army. … There’s a lot of stress related to starting a new career in the army, and here too, with the academics. … [We are] bringing them the grace of God, the aspect of faith and the aspect of grace in all of our counseling and guidance.”
Mohan said Dharm will provide the HSA with a figurehead and role model in the years to come.
“I’m very excited for the HSA community to have a mentor and role model,” Mohan wrote.“I’m also excited to increase the awareness and presence of Hinduism on campus as the number of Hindu students grows exponentially each year.”
As the first Hindu chaplain, Dharm will add a new facet of religious diversity on campus, O’Brien said.
“From its founding, Georgetown has committed itself to service of students of different faith traditions,” O’Brien said. “We are proud of our Catholic heritage, but to be Catholic in the world today is also to engage in substantial interreligious dialogue, and our hiring a Hindu chaplain to serve on our staff reflects this age old commitment to the service of students of all faiths and to interreligious dialogue.”
Dharm said she is pleased to help the university on its way to a more diverse and culturally eclectic community.
“It is very important to note that Georgetown has a tradition of diversity and celebrating diversity, and I think that this is a step forward in that,” Dharm said. “You couldn’t go more into diversity, you have to always only step forward. Each step that we take is a lesson for us all as a community. There will be many more steps that I am confident Georgetown will take.”

Following in the footsteps of Georgetown men’s basketball greats Patrick Ewing (CAS ’85) and Jeff Green (COL ’12), All-American Roy Hibbert (COL ’08) made a donation toward the construction of the John R. Thompson Jr. Intercollegiate Athletics Center, prompting fan-favorite CasualHoya to launch a giving campaign of its own.
The Indiana Pacers center’s $1 million gift came on Sept.  2, on the occasion of Thompson Jr.’s 73rd birthday.
The Thompson Athletic Center has gained a total of $5.3 million from these three donations in the past 11 days alone.
Hibbert credited Thompson Jr.’s son, current Head Coach John Thompson III, for his development as a player and a man during his time on the Hilltop.
“I am deeply indebted to Georgetown University and the basketball program for all they have done for me,” Hibbert said in a statement. “I put in a lot of hard work to get where I am, but I was given a tremendous amount of guidance both on and off the floor from Coach Thompson III and I wouldn’t be here without him.”
A member of Georgetown’s back-to-back Big East regular-season championship teams spanning 2006 to 2008, Hibbert brought the university closer to its $62 million overall funding goal with his donation.
Thompson III returned Hibbert’s gratitude with kind words of his own for his former player.
“This gift is significant but it is only one of the ways that [Hibbert] supports those who are coming behind him at Georgetown,” Thompson III said in a statement. “He has consistently shown that he is a man of actions, not merely words.”
The construction of the center will commence Sept. 12 with a groundbreaking ceremony. Highly touted Class of 2015 recruits Dwayne Bacon and Bryant Crawford will make their official visits to Georgetown on that day, making it a crucial day for Georgetown varsity athletics, and men’s basketball in particular.
In the midst of this flurry of donations, CasualHoya.com founder Andrew Geiger (COL ’99) has launched The Casual Campaign to aid what he considers a vital fundraising process.
“I believe the timely completion of the Thompson Center is the single most important venture for the future success and sustainability of the Georgetown basketball program,” Geiger wrote in an email. “In this new era of conference realignment and with Georgetown entering its second season in a very different-looking Big East, the school needs a facility like the [Thompson Athletic Center] in order to remain competitive with other programs both in and outside of the conference that are competing for the same top recruits.”
As the founder of the popular Georgetown men’s basketball blog, Geiger has engendered a significant response from the Georgetown community through his campaign.
“Since CasualHoya.com is the biggest site on the Internet for Georgetown basketball fans, I felt compelled to do what I could in order to help the cause,” Geiger wrote. “The response to The Casual Campaign has been overwhelmingly positive, and the timing of the initiative in concert with the donations from Ewing/Falk, Jeff Green and Roy Hibbert was perfect as there is an energy among Hoyas basketball fans right now about the project and a desire to make sure it gets completed on time.”
With the looming 2014-2015 basketball season, the importance of Hibbert’s gift and the Thompson Athletic Center project as a whole comes into clearer focus. The Thompson Athletic Center will house the new Georgetown Athletics Hall of Fame and men’s and women’s basketball coaches’ offices. The four-story, 144,000-square foot structure will be built adjacent to McDonough Arena, and will contain weight-training, sports medicine, team meeting and practice facilities for all varsity programs.

The Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs has partnered with the University of Notre Dame’s Center for Civil and Human Rights to create a new project, “Under Caesar’s Sword,” which will examine the growing issue of Christian persecution around the world.
The joint venture of the two Catholic schools has already received a $1.1 million grant from the Templeton Religion Trust and will send 14 of the world’s leading Christian scholars from universities across the United States to study in over 30 countries and present their findings at a conference in Rome in December 2015. Some of the countries include China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Egypt and India.
Notre Dame professor Dan Philpott proposed the idea after working closely with Berkley Center professors Timothy Shah and Thomas Farr on the Religious Freedom Project at Georgetown, and took the lead on writing the grant proposal.
“It is an effort to stand in solidarity with the persecuted Christians of the world,” Philpott said in a CCHR press release. “To advocate for the rights of Christians is not to claim that their human rights are more important than anyone else’s. Religious freedom is a fundamental human right to which everyone on the planet is entitled. Today, however, Christians constitute the lion’s share of those in the lion’s den.”
“Under Caesar’s Sword” aims to closely examine Christian persecution, how Christians respond to it and increase public awareness of the growing problem.
“We are providing the best possible scholarly analysis we can of what is going on. And this is an issue which is of enormous intellectual interest,” Shah said. “Christians are the world’s largest religious group.And a number of secular responsible analysts have pointed out that the group that’s facing the most harassment because of their religion is Christianity … and yet there’s very little scholarly study of this.And particularly very little study of what Christians are doing to respond to the discrimination and harassment and persecution that they’re facing.”
In addition to funding the research and sending the experts to over 100 Christian communities spanning the globe as long as a month, the grant will cover two additional measures geared toward increasing awareness.
“We have it as one of our official goals that our scholarship really have an influence on the world’s awareness of these problems,” Shah said.“Our second goal is public awareness. We want to increase the knowledge of relevant actors and parties of what’s going on … and we really want a big megaphone through which to announce our findings.”
In addition to the international conference, the project plans to fund another means for garnering the attention of the public.
“We’ll be spending a certain amount of money supporting the filming of a documentary which will be available, ultimately, online. We’ve hired a documentary film producer to travel to at least two or three countries where there is serious repression of Christian communities,” Shah said.
This project builds upon Berkley Center research fellow Rebecca Shah’s research, presented at the “Christianity and Freedom” conference in Rome in December 2013, which focused on the effect the conversion to Christianity had on the social and economic standings of Indian women.
Georgetown University Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., (CAS ’88) denounced the recent violence against Christians and explained that what students and faculty at Georgetown do is important in fighting religious persecution everywhere.
“The recent violence in Iraq against Christian minorities is only the latest in a series of attacks against Christian churches and people,” O’Brien said. “The targeting of any people because of their religion — whether Christian or not — is an affront against our common humanity as children of God. … What we do at Georgetown is part of the solution — teaching people how to talk across religious differences and learning how to join together for peace and solidarity against the forces of violence and division.”
Philpott came up with the name, “Under Caesar’s Sword,” and Shah expects it to be an accurate representation of the situation in many countries.
“The name is inspired by the reality, the very grim reality, that huge numbers of Christians face very real violence, repression and persecution at the hands of governments, i.e. Caesar, around the world,” Shah said. “Of course, the project recognizes that in many cases, it’s not official governments that are doing the persecution. In a number of cases it’s groups, non-state actors, terrorist organizations, extremist groups or grassroots uncivil members of society that are perpetrating the persecution. But in many cases, of course, it’s the government, hence the title, ‘Caesar’s Sword.’”

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak spoke about the future of Asia’s government and security in Gaston Hall on Tuesday.
Razak’s lecture, which focused on key issues such as the rise of China and the role of the United States in a multipolar international order, marked the first Lecture Fund event featuring a head of government this academic year.
“The way we respond to these issues will determine Asia’s future,” Razak said. “Confronted with the complex disagreements between states, Asia must place its trust in diplomatic solutions.”
Gaston Hall was filled with students as well as members of delegations from both the Malaysian and U.S. governments Tuesday.
After recognizing the past dominance of the United States on the global stage, Razak then discussed the emergence of many Asian powers including China, Japan and India, not only in regard to their economic transformation but also their political reforms.
“We must heed the fundamental principles upon which diplomacy is conducted: sovereign equality, respect for territorial integrity, peaceful settlement of disputes and mutually benefiting relations,” Razak said.
Razak, who came to Georgetown after attending the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, also emphasized his personal connection to the university during his speech, praising the education two of his children received in the School of Foreign Service and reminding students to tread carefully, both on the Exorcist Steps and on the seal outside of Healy Hall.
The prime minister talked about the positive influence of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which Malaysia will chair in 2015. He asserted that the ASEAN code of conduct can help alleviate disagreements like those surrounding the territorial claims on the South China Sea.
Razak outlined key questions and issues that he believes will shape the future of Asia, regarding the rise of China and other nation’s reactions to Chinese leadership, the role of the United States in a multipolar world, and the shifting position of Japan in the 21st century.
After Razak finished his comments he spoke with US-ASEAN Business Council Vice President of Policy Marc Mealy. During this time, Razak condemned the actions of the Islamic State Group.
“They don’t speak for us. Whatever they are, and whatever actions they’ve done, they are against Islam, they are against God and they are against humanity,” Razak, whose country is primarily Muslim, said.
He stated that religious freedom in Malaysia has embraced the true ideals of Islam, which has resulted in over 40 years of peace and stability.
During a question-and-answer session following the talk, students asked Razak about issues ranging from the banned study of political science in Myanmar to his personal advice for young people.
One student questioned the heavy media censorship and the treatment of the ethnic elite in Malaysia, prompting a response from Razak that stressed Malaysia’s emphasis on democracy and an open society that can be clearly seen on social media.
Monica Mahal (COL ’17), who attended the event, said that she was impressed by Razak’s lecture.
“The prime minister touched upon a lot of themes that apply to all types of Georgetown students,” Mahal said. “He handled his questions very graciously, and he also shed light onto his personality which made the whole conversation much more enjoyable. … Overall it was really an informative and very enriching lecture.”

Jairam Ramesh, a member of India’s Parliament and a senior political leader in the Indian National Congress Party, spoke about the need for climate change policy in a lecture hosted by the Georgetown-India Dialogue and the School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program in the Intercultural Center auditorium on Friday.
Ramesh, who negotiated for India at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, spoke about the struggles that policy makers face when trying to find a diplomatic solution to climate change.
“We get it that climate change is here,” Ramesh said. “There are people still in the world who deny the signs of climate change. But my talk is based on the assumption backed by robust scientific evident that climate change is not a hoax, it is not an exaggeration, that global warming is a reality.”
Ramesh, a former minister who held the environment and forests and rural development portfolios, said that this type of climate change is, for the first time, created by humans, instead of natural processes. Despite changes in scientists’ understanding of climate change and increased evidence of its anthropogenic causes, negotiations have remained the same.
“We have yet to discover an economic model that is decoupled from pollution, and economic model that is decoupled from deforestation and an economic model that is decoupled from carbon emissions,” Ramesh said. “The paradox is the world has changed from 1992 but the negotiating framework remains ossified in a world of 1992.”
Ramesh also highlighted the fact that different countries handle climate change in different ways, using the term “common but differentiated responsibilities.”
“It means that we all have common, we are all in this together because climate change is a common responsibility, so it is a common responsibility but it is a differentiated responsibility,” Ramesh said. “What that CBDR is has been left delightfully vague to be interpreted by countries as they chose to see fit.”
Ramesh argued that the problem with this is that different countries have interpreted CBDR in different ways, but said he hopes for a universal solution within the next year.
“In Paris in 2015, it is widely expected that the international community will finally come up with an international agreement, with a global agreement,” Ramesh said. “It would send a clear signal to the world that every country is going to take on some responsibility or the other to do its bit to control global warming.”
Ramesh said that as this conference approaches, policymakers face a “trilemma” between the architecture of the agreement, differentiation between countries and legal implications.
“All three are important,” Ramesh said. “You have to have an agreement that is politically feasible, you have to have an agreement that is economically desirable because you have to have economic growth to generate jobs you can’t do that without economic growth. And you need an agreement that is also environmentally optimal.”
Jeh Tirodkar, a founding member of the Georgetown-India Dialogue, said that the group brought Ramesh to campus due to his background in economics, politics and climate change diplomacy.
“With his knowledge on the issue and the experiences he has at Copenhagen he is one of the foremost authorities on climate change,” Tirodkar wrote in an email to The Hoya. “More importantly, the thought of Mr. Ramesh being the first politician The Georgetown-India Dialogue brought to campus made perfect sense.”
Paul Selling (COL ‘18) said he thought the event was interesting because it explained the United States’ precarious situation in the climate change crisis.
“What particularly interested me was the difficulties with the framework,” Selling said. “Right now, we are based on stock and flow, but the current framework is requiring the United States to have a larger commitment to stopping the fossil fuels while other countries who are contributing to the flow don’t have to do that right now.”

Around the world in 70 days — this refrain describes Harmonie Kobanghe’s summer (SFS ’15) after winning the Raymond Dinsmore Fellowship from the Circumnavigators Foundation.
Kobanghe was awarded with a $9,000 grant to explore an international issue in 10 weeks, travelling to Peru, Brazil, Italy, Tanzania, India, Bhutan and Nepal to research women’s property rights and their relationship to food security.
“I interviewed government actors, civil society members and women farmers to see if there was any discrepancy between the law and the application of the law on the ground in terms of women’s property rights,” Kobanghe said.
The Circumnavigators Club honors those who have travelled around the world and crossed each meridian line of longitude in one direction. The Circumnavigators Foundation has sponsored over 100 students since its creation in 1964 and aims to improve international relations by creating a deeper cross-cultural understanding. Grants are primarily funded by donations from universities and members of the Circumnavigators Club.
As Kobanghe could choose the countries she wished to travel to, she said she attempted to pick countries based on their relationship to their continent and to her project topic.
“Since I was required to travel to at least three continents, I tried to pick countries that were meaningful within their own continent,” Kobanghe said. “I picked Brazil, for instance, because of the huge difference between small farming activities and the export of agricultural projects. I picked Italy because the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] and [International Fund for Agricultural Development] were there.”
After the Circumnavigators Club approved the list of countries, Kobanghe said her next challenge was to get in touch with government officials and women in each country. Once Kobanghe found responsive officials, she said that they directed her to women in the respective communities.
“I was lucky enough during my trip to have cities in mind where I wanted to go and when I was in the capital city of most of the countries, I met with government actors who led me to women … that I planned to visit,” Kobanghe said.
With many non-English speaking countries on her itinerary, she utilized Georgetown professors as resources and translators.
“I contacted Georgetown professors here and I asked them if they could help me translate my requests for interviews and they agreed to do so,” Kobanghe said. “It’s better than using Google Translate.”
Although Kobanghe said she planned to hire a translator, she found that people in each country were willing to help her with subsequent interviews.
“Luckily enough the people who I interviewed served as my translator for free,” Kobanghe said. “You meet good people along the way, so I didn’t have any issues there.”
Kobanghe, an international politics major pursuing a certificate in African studies, said that her trip inspired a topic for her senior thesis.
“I did some research but I also did some sightseeing,” Kobanghe said. “It’s a good grant, it’s a good opportunity to travel and research and enjoy your summer. … It’s also a good opportunity to explore new cultures, to taste new food, and meet interesting people.”
Kobanghe told the story of her summer at an information session Monday hosted by the School of Foreign Service Academic Council.
Anthony Pirrotti, a first-year student adviser and dean of international history, and culture and politics, also spoke to interested students.
“One of the goals of the Circumnavigators Club is to get [students] interacting with people,” he said. “They want you to be on the ground, doing field work, and seeing things for yourself.”
Forty-four Georgetown students have participated in the program since 1971, researching such topics as urbanization in third world countries, infrastructure development and refugee transit programs.
The grant is available to rising seniors in the SFS who did not study abroad during their junior year.
Morgan Forde (SFS ’16), a prospective applicant, said that this 10-week trip would be a suitable replacement for a semester abroad. Forde expressed interest in going to Eastern Europe and studying development issues, such as capacities for Internet access.
“I am not able to study abroad during the year, [so] this sounded like a great opportunity to get out, see the world, and do some research,” Forde said. “It would be a great opportunity for me to just be able to get out and have a new perspective on the world I’m studying.”

The Supreme Court declined review on the three cases contesting same-sex marriage Monday, thus deferring to the decisions of the lower circuit courts and clearing the way for legalization of gay marriage. Now legalized in Virginia, Utah, Indiana, Wisconsin and Oklahoma, same-sex marriage is currently permitted in 30 states in the United States, with more expected to follow suit.
“This is an amazing victory for loving and committed same-sex couples in these states who now have the freedom and recognition that they deserve,” American Civil Liberties Union Director James Esseks wrote in a press release.
The ACLU acted as co-counsel in three of the five cases.
With the fourth, seventh and 10th circuits legalizing same-sex marriage, same-sex couples in other states within those circuits can expect to be able to marry within the coming month.
After the circuit courts ruled that the states’ same-sex marriage ban was discriminatory, and thus unconstitutional, the appeals went up to the Supreme Court. In the case of Virginia, in the Fourth Circuit, all of the states in Virginia’s circuit, which also includes Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia, will be subject to the law. Gay marriage was legalized in Maryland on Jan. 1, 2013, but those remaining three states in the Fourth Circuit have yet to see a ruling.
“It shouldn’t be long for someone to go to court and say, ‘Look, the Fourth Circuit has ruled this way, this state is in the Fourth Circuit, therefore you have to start allowing gay couples to marry,’” said Nan Hunter, a Georgetown University Law Center professor specializing in sexuality in the law. “So I think different states will move at different speeds, and some states may resist it very strongly, but I think that will happen in all six states, the indirectly affected states, within the next month or so.”
Campbell James (SFS ’17), media manager and historian of GU Pride, was hopeful that this ruling would spark a trend of same-sex marriage legalization across the country.
“We’re just really happy to see that a lot of LGBTQ people now have the opportunity to get married in a lot of states that I personally wouldn’t have imagined being in the first half of marriage equality in the country. I think it just sets a really exciting precedent for the coming months, the close future, eventually for all 50 states, to perform, recognize, allow same-sex marriage,” he said.
Esseks was also optimistic about the future.
“Ultimately, it means that we will soon see marriage in a lot more states. The Supreme Court’s action this morning sends an unmistakable signal that the nine justices are comfortable with the lower court decisions in favor of marriage, and we think that lower courts will read that loud and clear,” Esseks wrote.
Hunter said that she thought if the court had decided to rule, the right of same-sex couples to marry would have been upheld, but that the court most likely declined to rule to avoid making a sweeping decision that would affect so many U.S. citizens at once.
“I think the justices who support gay marriage think that they would win if the case were decided right now, but they also believe that the country is changing, and they can let these lower court decisions change one part of the country at a time, and let more people get used to the idea, before they have to announce a rule that would control the entire country,” Hunter said.
She added that she had not expected the courts to decline to rule. Instead, she said she thought the court would either grant certiorari, meaning to take a case and make a decision, or let the case sit.
“I didn’t expect them to do this. I expected them to either accept cert. or to deny cert., and then wait and see what happened with the next couple of circuits,” she said. “So I was surprised that they went ahead and—because they could have just kept those cases pending. It’s quite telling to me because what they did was —the effect of what they did was to allow marriages to go forward in those initial five and, ultimately, 11 states.”
James praised the Supreme Court for deferring to the lower circuit courts to decide this issue.
“I’ve always considered marriage a state issue, so I think it makes me happy that the Supreme Court has decided to uphold these courts rulings, and I feel like that shows support for the lower courts and these lower appellate judges and their abilities to make sound constitutional decisions,” James said.
As for the remaining U.S. circuits that have yet to legalize same-sex marriage, they will have the ability to make their own rulings. Hunter explained that if one or more of those circuits were to decide that the gay marriage ban is constitutional, that will cause a circuit split and the Supreme Court will be forced to issue a ruling on the case to resolve the circuit split.
If the remaining undecided courts independently rule that the marriage exclusion law is unconstitutional, however, the Supreme Court would never need to rule specifically on this issue.
“I think that this court is very clearly ducking this issue, at least for the time being,” Hunter said. “If it turns out hat the remaining three circuits also rule that marriage exclusion laws are unconstitutional, so that the whole country, bit by bit over time, has been covered, then I think it’s quite possible that the Supreme Court will not rule specifically on this question.”
This is not the Supreme Court’s first move that would pave the way for same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage last year when it voted to strike down part of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which denied benefits to same-sex married couples who were legally allowed to marry in their states.

The 20th annual Rangila dance show will be held at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts on Nov. 22 as a result of structural problems in the show’s usual venue, Gaston Hall.
The coordinators of the cultural dance performance, which is put on by the South Asian Society and will feature around 500 student dancers, officially signed a contract with the Kennedy Center last Friday.
Last month, The Office of Planning and Facilities Management performed an engineering analysis on Gaston Hall’s stage and found it to be structurally unsound for groups of over 45 people. Renovations will occur on the stage this summer.
Event coordinators Alisha Datwani (MSB ’15) and Medha Chandorkar (COL ’15) said that after discovering that Gaston Hall was no longer an option for the performance, they met with the Center for Student Engagement and the Office of the President to brainstorm venues.
“As soon as we found out that we didn’t have Gaston, we called a meeting with the South Asian Society board and we all collaboratively came up with every single option in the general vicinity of Georgetown as to where we could hold Rangila,” Datwani said.
Rangila Master of Ceremony Priya Sharma (MSB ’15) said that the sudden announcement regarding Gaston’s condition worried many performers and choreographers.
“The second you take away Gaston Hall, that’s at the core of what Rangila is, it’s a tradition,” Sharma said. “People are excited to perform in such a a prestigious hall. So when you say it’s not going to be there because the stage is not ‘structurally sound’— that was the phrase continuously used — people were anxious,” Sharma said.
After considering numerous options, the Office of the President helped SAS secure the Kennedy Center. According to the University President John J. DeGioia’s Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara, the office’s past collaboration with the Kennedy Center on events like “Let Freedom Ring!” for Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the “Faith, Culture and the Common Good” conference, which the university co-hosted with the Vatican’s Pontifical Council for Culture and the Archdiocese of Washington, made this agreement feasible.
“As a result of our relationship with the Kennedy Center and an opening in their performance calendar, we had the opportunity to host this event there this year,” Ferrara wrote in an email. “We are excited for Rangila to celebrate its 20th anniversary with a performance at a venue that is such an important part of the community.”
Chandorkar said that this year will most likely be the only time that Rangila will be held in the Kennedy Center.
“We are all going to sit down and look at what Rangila will look like in the future. The Kennedy Center just frankly isn’t a realistic option for a year-to-year basis but we have confidence that going on from here it’s going to get better and better,” Chandorkar said.
Datwani and Chandorkar said that although the venue has changed, they are striving to maintain the energy and spirit of a Georgetown tradition.
“Even though it’s an amazing opportunity and an amazing venue, we didn’t want to compromise so much that it didn’t become Rangila,” Vasant said. “We kept that mind throughout the process. Really there aren’t too many things changing other than the fact that Gaston was never built for a dance performance so to have a stage with a full light array and space, it’s really fantastic to be on a stage that was made to dance on.”
Choreographer Matthew Chan (COL ’15) said that although he will miss Gaston Hall, he is eager to perform at a world-famous venue.
“There is some sentimentality attached to Gaston because it’s something so intrinsically Georgetown, but when you think about D.C. in general, the Kennedy Center is the place to be,” Chan said. “When you think about the East Coast and you think about where is the biggest stage you can perform ever, the Kennedy Center is right up there. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”
One major change to the usual two-show Rangila performance is that it will now be held on only one night. The Kennedy Center fits 2,300 to Gaston Hall’s 800, and Chandorkar said they predict the sale of 1,800 tickets for the single performance. Some of those tickets have been reserved for alumni, dignitaries, faculty, staff and families of performers.
“We are allocating to more family coming, more faculty and staff coming,” Datwani said. “Students who never get tickets will definitely get tickets this year.”
The extra 500 seats will serve as a waiting area for student dancers who want to watch their peers perform.
“Every year in Gaston, dancers who were waiting to dance go line up in the back and just watch the show unofficially and stand the whole time, but it’s very inconvenient,” Chandorkar said. “This year obviously Kennedy Center won’t allow that, so the top tier of seats — about 400 seats — are all reserved for dancers. So anyone who’s not in the wings waiting or on stage dancing can grab a seat and catch the show.”
Tickets to the performance have increased from $15 to $20, and Datwani said that they ensured that prices stayed low to allow all members of the community to attend the event.
“We personally feel like we stepped up the quality of the show this year and at the end of the day we are a student production, there was no way we were going to charge more than that,” she said.
The larger stage at the Kennedy Center has prompted choreography changes that will allow dancers to spread out, according to Datwani.
“We told them immediately after we knew that we didn’t have Gaston: ‘Plan for a bigger space,’” Datwani said. “What that means in terms of general formations and transitions: Formations can be bigger, better. The problem with Gaston is there is very little depth so finales look a little clustered and formations look flattened. So we told them to work with more space.”
The event will raise awareness for the Pritam Spiritual Foundation, a group based in Kashmir, India that provides medical aid for those injured by land mines.
“It’s amazing work not being done by any other group and we thought the interfaith aspect really fit into the Jesuit values of Georgetown, and their mission really aligns with Jesuit values, Georgetown values and Rangila as well,” Vasant said. “We love their work and we really want to support them and this year their funding was cut by 50 percent because the Indian army pulled all their funding. We wanted to step up and help them out.”
In honor of Rangila’s 20th anniversary, its theme this year is “A Story of Time Travel.”
The sheer size of the new venue has led to a few nerves for those set to perform before a sold-out house of 2,300 audience members and fellow performers.
“My reaction was ‘What have I gotten myself into?’ I thought I was going to be on stage with my [fellow MC Jimmy Ramirez (COL ’15)] in front of Gaston Hall, and now it’s 2,300,” Sharma said. “This number is very much ingrained in my mind. For me, it’s daunting.”

Washington, D.C., is the second-best place in the country at combatting the costs of lung cancer, according to the financial website Wallethub.
Wallethub ranked all 50 states and the District of Columbia based on their efforts to combat the economic and societal impacts of the disease, analyzing air quality, death rates from lung cancer, the number of tobacco users per capita and various other elements.
Hawaii was the only state to be ranked above the District, with Alaska, Utah and New Jersey rounding out the top five.
The final rankings were a composite of two factors: “favorable environment for avoiding lung cancer” and “lung cancer prevalence and prevention.” D.C. was ranked 14th and fourth, respectively.
According to the American Lung Association, the economic costs of smoking and lung cancer in D.C. exceed $600 million per year. There are over 650 cases of smoking-related cancer in the District each year, about 400 of which are lung cancer.
Roughly 20 percent of adults and 13 percent of high school students in D.C. smoke, with an estimated economic cost due to smoking of almost $627,000. In 2013, there were 724 deaths in D.C. attributable to smoking.
Wallethub’s study ranked D.C. fourth in the country for the lowest death rate from lung cancer, and fifth for the highest percentage of smokers who attempted to quit.
Despite the positive feedback from Wallethub, Kenneth Tercyak, a professor in the departments of oncology and pediatrics at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, said that state governments are not doing enough to prevent tobacco use.
“In D.C., we have smoke-free air laws and moderately high cigarette taxes,” Tercyak said. “However, the level of resources devoted to tobacco prevention and cessation fall short of national spending guidelines recommended by [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention].”
The American Lung Association assigns D.C. a letter grade of F in tobacco prevention and cessation coverage, but an A in smoke-free air and a B in cigarette taxes. Out of the estimated 1,030 people in D.C. who died from cancer in 2013, one in four died of lung cancer.
Lung cancer claims more lives in the United States than the next three most common types of cancer with a survival rate under 17 percent, and over 224,000 people in the United States will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, according to the CDC.
The disease has a high financial toll as well. According to the National Institute of Health, lung cancer accounts for over $12 billion of total cancer costs around the United States. Premature death from lung cancer among adults aged 20 and older results in over $36 billion in lost productivity each year.
Indiana University health science professor Jon Macy explained that preventing people from smoking is the most effective way to prevent lung cancer.
“State and local governments should implement comprehensive tobacco prevention and cessation programs,” Macy said. “Such programs would include increasing the cost of tobacco by raising taxes, adopting smoke-free air laws that prohibit smoking in all public places and workplaces, and providing access to proven tobacco cessation treatment.”
According to Chris Davis of the Lung Cancer Alliance, early detection is crucial in fighting the disease.
“Education and wellness programs as well as screening initiatives help combat lung cancer,” Davis said. “In fact, screening programs are already in place to help catch the disease earlier. We know that lung cancer screening can save lives when carried out responsibly and following current best practices.”
In the battle against lung cancer and smoking, a large disparity exists between states. For example, in terms of cigarette taxes, New York’s taxes, the highest in the nation, are 26 times higher than those in Missouri, the lowest.
“States vary considerably in their policies,” Macy said. “Some states still have tobacco taxes that are too low, some states still have smoke-free air laws that are too weak, and all states underfund their tobacco prevention and cessation programs.”
Despite the reduction in cigarette smoking across the country over the past 60 years, Macy warned that this progress was fragile.
“I think we are at a very important point in the fight against lung cancer,” Macy said. “If we adequately fund tobacco prevention and cessation programs, then we can continue this success and see further reductions in smoking-related diseases, including lung cancer.  If we don’t, then I don’t think we will see much progress.”

The Smithsonian Institution will renovate museums and gardens on the South Mall campus to improve infrastructure, visitor services and accessibility in a multiyear project that will begin in 2016, the institution announced Nov. 12.
The $2 billion redesign and restoration of the world’s largest museum and research complex will affect museums located between the National Mall and Independence Avenue SW, notably the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Arts and Industries Building, the Smithsonian Castle, the National Museum of African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, the Freer Gallery of Art and the S. Dillon Ripley Center. The other Smithsonian museums and galleries on the National Mall — the Air and Space Museum, the American Art Museum Portrait Gallery, the American History Museum, the National History Museum, the Postal Museum, and the Renwick Gallery — will remain untouched.
The proposed South Mall Campus Master Plan will be implemented over a 10- to 20-year period, combining major projects that will improve infrastructure of the Smithsonian museums and galleries, reinvent the style of the South Mall campus and ensure the energy efficiency of the complex. The cost of the master plan will be split between federal funding and privately raised funds, though fundraising has not begun yet.
Smithsonian Public Affairs Specialist Becky Haberacker explained that the renovations will focus on the oldest part of the Smithsonian campus.
“The proposed plan makes these museums more accessible to our visitors and better connects them to one another. It enables us to provide visitors with a better experience when they come to visit,” Haberacker said.
Haberacker confirmed that, despite the renovations of the South Mall campus, the respective identities and goals of each museum would remain the same.
“The mission and focus of each of the museums won’t change. The proposed South Mall Master Plan increases the usable space for the museums and helps all of the spaces — both above and below ground — flow together better. It also provides more space for public programs and educational activates,” Haberacker said.
The master plan was designed by a Denmark-based architectural firm, Bjarke Ingels Group, which has worked closely with the Smithsonian Institution to develop the redesign ever since the group’s proposal was chosen in March 2013.
“The design has a modern aesthetic that works in harmony with the classic architecture of the buildings that already exist in the South Mall Campus,” Haberacker said.
BIG founding partner and Master Plan architect Bjarke Ingels expressed his excitement regarding the redesign of the South Mall campus.
“It’s a great honor and a humbling challenge to reimagine one of the most significant American institutions on the front lawn of the nation’s capital,” Ingels said in a press release from the Smithsonian Institution. “We have created a new landscape of connectivity and possibility. We believe this plan holds the potential to guide the Smithsonian South Mall campus into the future while remaining firmly rooted in its heritage.”
The centerpiece of the master plan is the restoration is the Smithsonian Castle, which was built in 1855 and is the oldest structure of The Smithsonian Institution. Currently used as an information center and as headquarters for the institution, the castle will add two underground floors for visitor services, a cafe and a shop that will have direct access to the Enid A. Haupt Garden and the Ripley Center.
The redesign will also construct pathways to connect the museums and gardens on the South Mall campus.
“Currently, the museums are not connected to each other if you are traveling east to west or west to east on the campus. The proposed plan will link the museums together both above and below ground to enable visitors to move from one to another more easily,” Haberacker said.
The proposed master plan still awaits review by the National Capital Planning Commission, which will work with The Smithsonian Institution to ensure the renovations fulfill the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and Section 106 of the Historical Preservation Act. An updated master plan will be issued in a formal meeting in December.
Dan Corry (COL ’15) was excited by the changes, hoping it would inspire more students to visit the museums.
“[The Smithsonian is] a really important resource that is right at your fingertips. You have all these specialized museums basically in one place, and because of the Georgetown bubble, they are really underutilized by Georgetown students. How many people do you know who have gone to the National Museum of the American Indian?” Corry said. “I am excited to see how the renovations turn out.”
Andrea Roos (SFS ’17) agreed that the renovations would be a positive change.
“I’m excited that it seems the government is putting a higher priority on educating its public through methods other than the schooling system. It’s a move in the right direction,” she wrote in an email.

The Georgetown University Initiative on Innovation, Development and Evaluation, known as gui2de, will offer a one-credit economics incubator course that will allow students to research and design innovative solutions in developmental economics starting in the spring semester.
Students in the course will meet once a week to design projects that focus on governance, health, education and technology in developing countries. These projects will later be tested and evaluated in the field.
“The incubator course is an opportunity for students to learn about all of these different stages from initiative to evaluation,” gui2de Co-Director James Habyarimana said. “It’s also hopefully going to be about innovation. We want students to be thinking about what the problems are and mobilizing all the energy and creativity to tackle these problems.”
For the past two years, students have conducted empirical field-based research and created innovative programs and policies in developing countries through the gui2de program. Participants have travelled to developing regions in countries such as Kenya, Brazil and Rwanda. Habyarimana said that students will be able to travel to the regions of research in the summer through the new economics class.
“The goal is that we’ll have this course in the spring and in the summer, we’ll take a few students to the field and test some of the ideas that they generate,” Habyarimana said.
The course is open to upperclassmen and graduate students. According to gui2de Co-Director Billy Jack, the program welcomes students from different academic backgrounds.
“We don’t want to restrict entry based on what students have done here. We want a mix of people,” Jack said. “The idea is that innovation happens when different ideas come together. Who knows? That’s one of the big questions of economics actually — where this growth comes from.”
In previous years, projects developed by gui2de have included designing mobile applications that provide market price information for farmers in India, developing a mobile money platform to facilitate saving for education and creating a campaign for road safety intervention in Kenya.
The incubator course has received around 30 applications from pre-registration. The co-directors estimate that they will accept 10 or 12 students. Future opportunities for applications during the add/drop period are being considered.
Jack said that he would like to increase opportunities for the program in the future, but noted that any expansion would require additional grants.
“On the longer term, we’d be happy to have more [students]. In the longer term, we might find a way to combine it with the summer activity for it to be a full three-credit course,” Jack said. “Of course, it costs money to bring students to the middle of nowhere, keep them alive then bring them back.”
Last spring, Jack and Habyarimana conducted a trial run of the incubator course but failed to receive funding.
“It wasn’t a full course. I just reached out to about 10 PhD students, asked if they wanted to come over for pizza once a week,” Jack said. “We weren’t able to put together the funding for that group. They all applied to funding sources, and unfortunately did not get them.”
Whitney Odden (GRD ’14) became a program coordinator at gui2de after serving as a graduate assistant for the program. She noted that the program provided her with plenty of opportunities.
“Getting to interact with your professor in such a close-knit way is really important,” Odden said. “Being able to develop those kinds of relationships in this kind of institution, with this caliber of professors, and spending time hands-on working on problems with them is a really neat experience.”
Odden said that she learned various practical skills through the program.
“Part of the reason why I went back to school is that I didn’t really have any practical skills from a liberal arts education,” Odden said. “I didn’t know how to program anything. To get exposure to stuff like that is incredibly important. It doesn’t require you to commit to a full year or to focus on one thing. You’ll get a taste of a bit of everything, see what you like and know what you want to pursue from there.”

First lady Michelle Obama discussed methods to improve girls’ education worldwide at an event on Friday at the Brookings Institution, which also included two panel discussions featuring former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard.
The event, “Mobilizing for Children’s Rights, Supporting Local Leaders and Improving Girls’ Education,” was centered on exploring ways that community organizers and regional reforms could further girls’ education, which has continued to make strides in recent years. Obama noted that, while 56 million more girls attend school now than a decade ago, work toward gender equality in education is only beginning.
“What we’re talking about are the hard things like countless conversations, community meetings. We’re talking about hundreds of hours spent training and empowering local leaders on the ground,” she said. “We’re also talking about a shift in our own thinking so that we see families and communities less as a barrier to girls’ education and more as the source of the solution.”
In her keynote address, the first lady challenged the audience to embrace failure as an opportunity to learn what works and does not work in advancing female adolescent education. She said that if girls in schools around the world can overcome fear and community barriers, leaders in education could overcome logistical barriers to help them.
“Our challenges in doing that are nothing compared to the challenges these girls face, and if we can show just a fraction of their passion and courage and determination then I’m confident that we can give all our girls the education that they deserve. That’s why I’m here,” she said. “I want you all to know that I am committed to this issue. I’m in.”
The first lady’s comments were bookended by two panels, each focused on mobilizing community solutions to the education situation. In the first panel, Gillard echoed a need to engage leaders at the local level in order to address the differing needs of dynamic communities around the globe.
“One of the things I think we always need to do is strengthen the intersection between our local education groups and local leaders because the more grounded that can be in experiences within [countries], the better the answers that are going to be generated,” she said. “It’s never a case of one size fits all.”
Urvashi Sahni, CEO of Study Hall Educational Foundation, an organization that provides education to marginalized Indian children with a focus on girls, said that in many places around the world, gender is a life and death issue and that patriarchal societies should reform their structures to empower young women.
“In a democratic constitution, patriarchal structure has no modern justification whatsoever,” she said. “So let’s look at the social structure, let’s look at patriarchy, let’s look at how power plays itself out in our society…and see how we can make it better. “
Campaign for Female Education Regional Executive Director Angeline Murimirwa recounted her own experience overcoming poverty to receive an education in Zimbabwe. She said that education should not alienate girls from their communities.
“[Education] allows you to become a celebration point for the community and then you start shining,” she said.
In the second panel, moderated by Glamour magazine editor-in-chief Cindi Leive, 17-year-old Namunyana Mwajuma, the youngest panelist, embodied the potential of education. Although her father went missing in 2013, the humanitarian organization CARE, which focuses on fighting global poverty, helped her mother with a savings program that allowed Mwajuma to raise the funds to return to school in Uganda, allowing her to hope of becoming a nurse one day.
“When I went back to school I became happy and excited,” she said. “I gained confidence, knowledge [and] life skills … that have made me who I am today.”

Georgetown University welcomed 13 percent of its early action applicants, a slightly smaller proportion than last year, into the Class of 2019 this past week.
The university sent out acceptance letters on Friday to 907 of the 6,840 applications, down from the 14 percent early action acceptance rate for the Class of 2018.
“Over the next few nights, admissions ambassadors — students — will be making phone calls to students to congratulate, and we’ll begin the process of hopefully winning them for Georgetown,” Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said.
Deacon said that the admissions committee reserved more space than usual for regular decision applicants, whose submissions are due Jan. 10. The admissions office expects approximately 500 of the admitted early action students to enroll at Georgetown by the May 1 deadline, comprising a little less than one-third of the Class of 2019.
“The admissions committees chose to accept fewer this time around even though the pool was the same, largely because there is this idea that we want to make sure we have enough room for the good candidates in April,” Deacon said. “Nationally, that’s going the other direction, where places like [the University of Pennsylvania] are taking 56 percent of their class early. … There’s a tendency of colleges to lock in early decision candidates.”
Deacon also explained that Georgetown generally limits the number of early acceptances because the pool for early admissions includes more students with privileged access to application resources than the regular decision pool.
“Early tends to favor the advantaged. Fewer minorities apply early, fewer first-generation kids apply early, fewer kids from the center of the country apply early. So the idea is when you take a lot of early [applications], you’re favoring people who are ahead of the game,” he said.
Applicants were accepted from 49 states, missing only North Dakota. Deacon said “a couple” of students from the state had applied but expected more in the regular decision period.
Nine percent of the admitted students were black, 12 percent were Hispanic, 14 percent were Asian-American and 1 percent was American Indian. International students from 34 countries, constituted 7 percent of the admitted.
Georgetown College, which saw 3,854 applications, over a hundred more than last year, accepted 459 students, an acceptance rate of 12 percent. The other three undergraduate schools each featured acceptance rates of 15 percent. The Walsh School of Foreign Service admitted 209 of 1,360 applicants, the McDonough School of Business accepted 173 of 1,193 and the School of Nursing and Health Studies welcomed 66 of 433. Deacon expected the overall acceptance rate after the regular decision period to stabilize around 16 to 17 percent.
Despite a declining high school graduate population, Georgetown maintained its level of early action applications, seeing a small increase from the previous year. Deacon said that since the university does not use the Common Application, the stability was encouraging and would allow the admissions committee not to worry about yield rates when making their decisions.
“We have resisted doing the Common Application, partly because we want to know more about you as a Georgetown applicant. This hasn’t had a negative impact on our pool,” Deacon said. “We get people who actually have us in their top four or five choices, so our yield’s pretty good. We don’t deny people because we think they’re not going to come. We take the best people, and we get about half.”
All early action applicants that were not accepted are automatically deferred to the regular decision pool and will learn their final fates in March.

Penn Masala, University of Pennsylvania’s South Asian a cappella group, will perform to a sold-out Gaston Hall on Saturday evening.
The proceeds of student and regular tickets, costing $12 and $20, respectively, will be donated to Pratham USA, a non-governmental organization that helps improve the quality of education for children in India.
The performance, sponsored by Deloitte Consulting, SAPAN Institute, GU Jawani, Georgetown and Penn Masala, will feature 12 a cappella performers from Penn Masala as well as performances by the SAPAN Institute and Raaga Dance Company.
Formed in 1996, Penn Masala mixes sounds from Bollywood and contemporary pop music to create a unique blend. The group has over 29,000 followers on YouTube and has released eight full-length albums.
“Basically, how we got our start was that our founder had the idea to fuse Bollywood music with western pop because it’s what we grew up with,” Penn Masala member Pranay Sharma said. “Most of us are Indian Americans and we grew up with both of these vastly different genres in our lives and when we came to college, there was nothing filling this gap. That’s where Penn Masala comes in.”
Penn Masala Music Director Prashant Ramesh said that the group provides representation for Indian Americans.
“The way that we see ourselves is that we represent people who have a similar background of us, who grew up in America but are still pretty true to their Indian heritage,” Ramesh said. “We love being a voice or representing them in as best of a way as we can through our music.”
The performance, which was planned in only two months, came about after Georgetown graduates at Deloitte Consulting decided to plan a fundraiser for Pratham, a group that Deloitte has heavily partnered with for the past four years.
“As a result of the partnership, the thought process behind this event evolved from two different points,” Deloitte Consultant Silky Kadakia (COL ’12) said. “We wanted to do something that would really benefit Pratham in a big way and showcase Deloitte’s continued commitment to helping Pratham achieve its mission, but at the same time I think one of our partners and practitioners had seen Penn Masala and know their international acclaim and wanted to bring them to campus and to D.C. in order to create this fundraiser.”
The event, which sold out with around 720 seats, is one of Penn Masala’s largest venues, according to Kadakia.
“We’re all excited to be able to host it at Georgetown because Gaston is such an iconic place and I will say that this is probably one of the larger venues and audiences that Penn Masala has played for,” Kadakia said. “I know that they’re very excited and the partner organizations that are involved are also very excited.”
Kadakia said that the planning process before the event was extremely rewarding because it has given Pratham a platform to increase awareness about its mission.
“The best part about planning this so far is to see how many different types of people are interested in giving back to Pratham and coming to the fundraiser,” Kadakia said. “Probably most importantly, I think more people now know about the charity and the cause, and having that as one of the main goals and achievements has been huge.”
Deloitte Partner and Pratham member Hemal Vaidya (SFS ’95) said that Pratham is excited about the upcoming performance.
“Pratham is very excited to have this event in which Penn Masala is the headliner, and this is the first time that we are having an event by Penn Masala for which the proceeds are going directly to Pratham,” Vaidya said. “This is an inaugural event and we hope that, given the attendance that we anticipate, it’s going to be a huge hit and hopefully that we can replicate for years.”
Members of Penn Masala are eager to help Pratham through their performance, according to Ramesh.
“In recent years we’ve had the fortunate opportunity to do performances for various charity causes and we really love to do that,” Ramesh said. “The fact that our music, something we just do as a hobby in school, is able to be used for such a good cause is really amazing and humbling for us.”

Akshay Sinha (GRD ’15), a second-year student in the McCourt School of Public Policy, was awarded the 2014-15 McCourt School Whittington Scholarship. As part of the scholarship, Sinha received an $11,000 financial award and will be recognized at the McCourt School’s Whittington Lecture.
“Akshay excels academically and is committed to community service. When selected, he had the second highest GPA in the Master of Public Policy program. He also volunteers in many McCourt and non-McCourt activities,” McCourt School Director of Communications Lauren Mullins said. “The McCourt School is thrilled to recognize Akshay, an exemplary student at our School. The Whittington Scholarship is incredibly meaningful to our community.”
The Whittington Scholarship was created in memory of Leslie Whittington, a former dean of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute and professor who died in the 9/11 attacks with her husband and two children. The annual scholarship is awarded to a second-year McCourt School student who displays high academic achievement and commitment to service.
Sinha, a student from New Delhi, came to Georgetown after working for KPMG Advisory Services in Mumbai, India for three years and decided to attend the McCourt School because of his interest in clean energy.
“I used to work in consulting and I’ve always been very interested in energy and energy projects as such. I wanted to get more involved with project design, financing and specifically, clean energy projects. It was logical for me to do a public policy program. The McCourt School happened to be the best and was based out of D.C.,” Sinha said.
Committed to community involvement and service, Sinha is an active member of student groups including a community soccer team and the Georgetown Public Policy Student Association, while also having volunteered with non-Georgetown affiliated organizations such as the Irish Wheelchair Association in Dublin, Ireland and the Missionaries of Charity in Kolkata, India. Sinha explained his commitment to community involvement as an important element of his education.
“For me, school has never just been about academics. Schools are always about community. The best part about going to school is that it gives you time to explore things you don’t have time to do in the rest of your life. You have time to get involved and meet new people. It’s a lot of fun and its also very educative to learn about other people,” Sinha said.
Last year, as the GPPSA Interest Representative, Sinha was responsible for intra-student interactions and for organizing events that allowed students to share their experiences with one another. Sinha is now the treasurer of the GPPSA.
He also emphasized his relationships with other students and his professors as integral to his education and experience at the McCourt School.
“My fellow students are really great and very intelligent people. There is a lot that I can learn from them and I think I have learned as much from them as I have learned in class. There is a big sense of community we have here,” Sinha said.
Andreas Kern, Sinha’s thesis advisor and a visiting assistant professor of international political economy, development economics and European policy, called Sinha an exceptional and deserving student.
“Akshay is an exceptionally well-trained, intellectually curious, hard-working and very humble student with a great sense of humor and a strong passion for evidence-based policy making. He also has a strong passion for finding sustainable and feasible solutions to complex policy challenges,” Kern said.
Kern first met Sinha when Sinha approached him about his project on suicides among farmers in the Indian cotton industry. Having met with Sinha and the group of students he worked on the project with, Kern was very impressed by the group’s creativity and with the ideas they produced, noting Sinha’s passion and strong work ethic.
“I realized that Akshay is a student, who is willing to run the extra mile in order to make a difference and to improve the lives of those among us in this world that are less fortunate than him/us,” Kern said.
Sinha explained that most second-year graduate students apply for the McCourt School’s scholarships with a common application that evaluates both academic performance and community involvement.
“I wasn’t really expecting to win the scholarship so it was definitely a surprise. I wasn’t expecting to get anything because there are so many other deserving students. It was a very pleasant surprise and was uplifting and in a sense, very inspiring,” Sinha said.
Currently writing his thesis on oil price volatility and the adoption of renewable energy, Sinha wants to work in designing, implementing and managing clean energy projects in developing countries after graduation.
“I want to work in the field of clean energy. I am interested in working specifically within developing countries on medium to large-scale clean energy projects. I want to structure, design and look for ways to finance these projects,” he said.

The first two Georgetown University Law Center students selected as part of a Department of Defense program visited the military commissions and observed pre-trial hearings at Guantanamo Bay in November and December. Additional student trips are planned for the coming months.
Selected through an application process available only to second-year and third-year law students, as well as Master of Law students, Kayleigh Golish (LAW ’15) attended proceedings from Nov. 3 to Nov. 8, which primarily dealt with pre-trial evidentiary motions related to the impending trial of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, a Saudi Arabian citizen accused of orchestrating the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 before his arrest in 2002.
“The most interesting [motion] to me was that the defense counsel was requesting that the death penalty be taken off the table as a possible punishment for al-Nashiri because of the limitations with accessing classified information,” Golish said. “I thought that was a really interesting conversation that was worth having.”
Shaw Drake (LAW ’15) visited the base from Dec. 14 to Dec. 17 to observe hearings related to the 9/11 case, which includes charges against five members of al-Qaida for orchestrating the deadly attack in New York City and Washington, D.C. While Drake was there, the potential conflict of interest for a lawyer of one of the defendants was dominating the proceedings.
“An FBI investigation targeted one of the members of the defense team,” Drake said. “If your attorney is under investigation by the FBI, that could affect the decisions that they make.”
Another critical motion being considered was the refusal of the defendants to attend meetings with their lawyers because of the presence of women guards in the movement of prisoners.
“The five 9/11 detainees were refusing to go to attorney meetings or court because women were now in positions where they would physically touch them,” Drake said.
After several closed-door sessions with the lawyers that the observers could not view, the judge in the case decided to cancel the hearings, denying Drake the chance to view any proceedings.
“It seems like a calculation was made by the judge: Do we hold the meeting that probably gets us nowhere because the prosecution is not prepared … and in doing so, do we bring beaten up and bloodied defendants into the courtroom because they’ve had to be forcibly removed from their cells and tied down? It’s probably not worth doing that,” Drake said.
The Guantanamo Bay Naval Base was a primary subject in the “torture report” released by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in December, which detailed prisoner abuses used to elicit information and confessions from prisoners at the base. Despite the cancellation of the hearings, Drake explained that the defense counsel met with the observers to discuss some of the issues behind the trial, particularly in relation to the torture discussed in the Senate report.
“[Torture] was a dominating discussion topic … It’s pretty clear that the trial is going to have months and months of arguments around that topic,” Drake said. “The defense team has claimed all along that the way their clients were treated will and should impact the reliability of the evidence and the usage of any statements that they’ve made. They alluded in that conversation that what was released in that report is purely the tip of the iceberg.”
Golish echoed Drake, explaining that the question of torture was ever-present in the Guantanamo commissions.
“Someone who’s been subjected to torture, can they give a voluntary confession?” Golish said. “Every defense counsel is going to try to bring those issues to the forefront and try to use them specifically as mitigating factors.”
Both cases are stuck in the pre-trial stage. According to Drake, the defense counsel in the 9/11 case do not expect a trial until 2017, while the al-Nashiri case is projected by some to start later in 2015, though the defense was pessimistic.
“It’s really quite incredible, not in a good sense, how long it takes, because al-Nashiri is facing charges for events that happened in 2000, before 9/11, and he was arrested in 2002. His trial is starting potentially 13 years later. What does that say for fair and speedy trials?” Golish said.
The observer status conferred upon GULC by the Department of Defense primarily applies to non-governmental organizations, though other universities, including Yale University, Indiana University, Seton Hall University and the University of Toledo, have all sent observers to the proceedings as well. GULC’s Center on National Security and the Law Executive Director Nadia Asancheyev (LAW ’06) said that the law center thought the observer status would provide a platform for students to experience the law in practice.
“We have such a depth of expertise on these issues at Georgetown Law … that we could fulfill the Department of Defense’s mission of having observers go and be able to really do a lot with the information that they gathered,” Asancheyev said. “We just saw a natural opportunity to enhance their learning.”
Asancheyev noted that even as three additional trips were pending for January and February, GULC would continue sending observers as long as the program continued.
“When they have a hearing set, it appears that then they go to the observer pool — and we’re in the observer pool — and ask for nominations for people they want to send,” Asancheyev said. “As long as they are continuing to prosecute people at military commissions at Guantanamo, we intend to send representatives as observers.”
Drake pointed to the program as setting the university in a position to interact with important national issues.
“It puts Georgetown in a unique place to be able to engage with major issues that will make headlines over the next few years, and establishing ourselves as a law school that will send qualified and prepared students to engage actively in this observation project is something that will set Georgetown apart,” Drake said.
Golish reflected on her experience, explaining that viewing the trial had given her a nuanced understanding of the issues surrounding the military commissions. As a member of the Journal of National Security Law and Policy, she explained that the organization was planning a symposium to address issues of terrorism trials and would incorporate her experience into the discussion.
“I think there is a lot of stuff that is still unsettled in terms of rights these people have and whether we’re okay with that. We’re a country that believes in laws and adheres to laws and yet, the laws, as they apply to this set of people, who we’re not crazy about, are not clear,” Golish said. “I also went into these proceedings thinking that they were completely unfair. But after going, you realize that people are trying to achieve justice, but the practices haven’t quite caught up with the law and vice versa. And everything surrounding these commissions is very hazy about where the legal lines really are.”

United States Agency for International Development administrator Dr. Rajiv Shah has been appointed as a distinguished fellow for Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service. Shah will join the SFS faculty March 1 and will reinforce the university’s commitment to global economic development, working with SFS Global Human Development program director Steven Radelet.
Shah deferred comment on his new position until he arrives on campus in March, and SFS Interim Dean James Reardon-Anderson and Associate Dean Mitch Kaneda deferred comment until they begin work with Shah in the upcoming months.
Shah led President Barack Obama’s global hunger and food security initiative, Feed the Future and Power Africa, which has worked with over 7 million small-scale farmers in 19 countries to reduce poverty and malnutrition. Feed the Future has improved the nutrition of 12 million children and continues to sustainably reduce poverty and hunger around the world.
Shah also pushed America’s global health partnerships to join UNICEF and put an end to preventable child deaths in countries like Ethiopia and India. The program has helped the number of children under age five who die each year to drop from 12 million in 1990 to 7 million in 2011. Shah also directed the U.S. government’s responses to urgent humanitarian crises like the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the recent Ebola outbreak.
Before working at USAID, Shah worked in the U.S. Department of Agriculture as undersecretary and chief scientist. Shah created the National Institute for Food and Agriculture, an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. NIFA aims to advance agricultural research, education and extension to address societal concerns in the United States.
Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia said in a statement on the university website that Georgetown students and faculty will benefit from Shah’s experience at USAID.
“Through innovative technology and engagement with diverse corporate and community sectors, Rajiv Shah’s leadership at USAID has worked to solve some of the world’s most pressing challenges,” DeGioia said. “Our students and university community will greatly benefit from his experience in international development and humanitarian responses.”
Radelet, who Shah will be working with at the SFS, worked as chief economist for USAID before joining the SFS faculty in 2012. Radelet commended Shah’s work and leadership abilities.
“Raj Shah is one of the most creative and energetic development leaders in the world today,” Radelet said in a statement on the university website. “He has led USAID through some of the biggest changes in its history and leaves the agency much stronger than when he arrived five years ago. We are thrilled that he has joined us at Georgetown.”

Legislation to permit concealed firearms on college campuses is currently being considered in 10 states, with gun rights advocates arguing that such laws would reduce sexual assault.
Bills to allow guns on college campuses are currently being considered in Florida, Nevada, Indiana, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming.
A committee of the Florida State Senate passed a bill legalizing firearms on college campuses Feb. 19, though the bill still must be passed by the full Senate. State Representative Dennis K. Baxley defended the legislation on the basis of preventing sexual assault.
“If you’ve got a person that’s raped because you wouldn’t let them carry a firearm to defend themselves, I think you’re responsible,” Baxley said during a House subcommittee meeting, according to The New York Times.
Sixteen states currently forbid firearms on campuses, according to data from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Twenty-four states allow individual schools to decide, while 10 states already permit guns on campus.
While it does not allow firearms on college campuses, Washington, D.C.’s ban on concealed carry of firearms was overturned in July. Legislation passed by the D.C. Council in response to the federal court decision imposed stringent requirements on the licensing process and prevented the carrying of firearms in government buildings, schools and public transportation.
Although D.C. allows conceal and carry, it does not affect university policy, according to Emma Iannini (SFS ’16), president and co-founder of Georgetown Against Gun Violence, a student organization formed in February.
“I have talked to administrators who are experts on campus safety, and they all say the same thing. Here at Georgetown we have leadership who know that there is nothing to be gained by adding more guns to campus,” Iannini said.
The university’s Code of Student Conduct includes the “possession or use of any potentially dangerous object or weapon, including … firearms” as a conduct violation to be adjudicated by the Office of Student Conduct.
GAGV Vice President and Co-Founder Sarah Clements (COL ’18) explained that the debate over allowing firearms at universities began in the wake of several shootings on college campuses, most notably the shooting at Virginia Tech University in April 2007.
“Even though most, if not all, of the survivors and victims’ family members of Virginia Tech advocated against campus carry in the wake of that shooting, there were some people who said, well, the only logical thing that could have prevented this was if somebody in that room had a gun,” Clements said. “From there the NRA really uses it as a ploy to sell more firearms and to try and reach out to a demographic that they really desperately need, which is young people.”
Iannini noted that the bills circulating around the country would force public universities into actions they would otherwise be reluctant to take.
“Public universities who are reliant on funding from these same state legislatures could literally be under fire from this,” Iannini said. “They are the ones who would be forced to follow the letter of the law passed by the legislature and either be encouraged or forced to allow students and administrators, people who really shouldn’t be armed, running around campus.”
Clements added that allowing firearms on college campuses would amplify existing dangers in student life.
“The gun lobby doesn’t know what college life is like. We do. There are really great things about college, but there are also negative sides like drinking on the weekends and sometimes drug use,” Clements said. “A lot of times of depression and high tension and high-stress situations almost constantly: to put a gun, a firearm, in those situations is completely dangerous and completely illogical.”
While lawmakers are pointing to sexual assault prevention as the reason driving gun liberalization, Sexual Assault Peer Educator Nora West (SFS ’15) said that concealed weapons would not address the sexual assault problem.
“Regardless of issues with students properly using weapons … 90 percent of college sexual assaults are committed by acquaintances,” West said. “[It is] unlikely that students would be carrying around their weapon at all times and using it against an acquaintance.”
West added that this proposed solution to sexual assault emphasizes the need for potential victims to take action, rather than addressing the perpetrator of the crime.
“It places the responsibly with the victims to defend themselves rather than directly blaming the perpetrators and simultaneously lets campus police off the hook as the ones who should be able to protect all students in the event of a potential violent crime,” West said. “It creates yet another opportunity for the survivor to be blamed for their perpetrator’s actions.”
Although Georgetown University College Republicans Chair Amber Athey (COL ’16) agreed with West on the issue of sexual assault, she said that conceal and carry would not necessarily be a bad thing for all universities.
“Many factors are involved in creating and maintaining an atmosphere of safety and security on college campuses; one specific policy is not going to be relevant for all types of universities. While concealed carry may be a suitable complement to other security measures on one campus, it may not make sense for another,” Athey said.
West said she felt that there were more effective solutions to the problem of sexual assault than allowing guns to be carried on campus.
“[We should focus on] education and outreach resulting in bystander intervention,” West said.

Following World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim’s speech on tactics to address climate change at Gaston Hall on Wednesday, members of GU Fossil Free stormed the stage and asked Kim for his opinion on the divestment movement.
During the transition from the speech to the question-and-answer session of Kim’s lecture, which was part of a lecture series sponsored by the Global Futures Initiative, three members of GU Fossil Free — Patricia Cippolitti (SFS ’15), Chloe Lazarus (COL ’16) and Elaine Colligan (SFS ’15) — walked onto the stage and unfurled a large banner. Three other members of the group, who stood first in the question-and-answer session line, asked Kim to address the issue of divestment.
The GU Fossil Free members held the banner, which read “‘CORPORATE LEADERS SHOULD NOT WAIT TO ACT UNTIL MARKET SIGNALS ARE RIGHT & NATIONAL INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE IN PLACE.’ – Jim Yong Kim GEORGETOWN, DIVEST NOW GU Fossil Free.”
Vice President for Global Engagement Thomas Banchoff, who moderated the question-and-answer session, paused and looked at the sign with Kim, then continued the session. Several Georgetown University Police Department officers requested the members to leave the stage. Five minutes later, they were escorted down the steps by the officers. They then moved to the back of the hall before being asked to leave the hall entirely.
GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber did not respond to requests for comment, while Banchoff declined to comment on the incident.
The event began with opening remarks from Banchoff and University President John J. DeGioia, who reiterated the Global Futures Initiative’s purpose of setting Georgetown as an example of a global university committed to serving others.
“This initiative … was launched in January to bring together the expertise of our community, the resources of our tradition and our commitment to the common good to discern and to model what it means to be engaged as a global university in service to the world,” DeGioia said.
Kim began the lecture by addressing the World Bank’s objectives to limit extreme poverty to three percent of the global population and to elevate the living standards of the bottom 40 percent of every country’s population.
Kim continued by laying out the scientific facts about climate change that he pointed out were supported by 97 percent of scientists. In particular, he noted that 2014 was the hottest year on record, and that 13 of the hottest years on record occurred in the last 15 years.
“Recently the extreme temperatures have hit the physiological limits of what humans and animals can withstand in being outside,” Kim said. “There’s really no more serious debate in the scientific community about the fact of global warming and that humans are playing a part in it.”
Kim then discussed the impact of climate change on development, including the possibility of floods and natural disasters leading to outbreaks of diseases like cholera and malaria in poor countries.
“We know that the poor will be affected the most,” Kim said. “Poor countries around the world are not ready for these disasters.”
In suggesting possible solutions to the consequences of climate change on development, Kim proposed that developing regions should implement the model of “smart cities.” For instance, he cited projects such as bus rapid transit lines in India, which significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Additionally, Kim criticized current fossil fuel subsidies from top oil-producing countries such as Egypt and Iran while promoting carbon taxes, climate smart agriculture, climate treaties and alternative energy. He concluded the lecture by addressing the responsibility of the students in attendance.
“I just want to let you know that this is going to be up to you,” Kim said. “I came here to talk to you about this specifically in order to send you a message. No matter what you end up doing — you can be investors, homeowners, drivers, and consumers — every choice you make can have an impact potentially on this particular issue. The most important thing is to educate yourselves.”
During the question-and-answer session, Kim answered the first question on Twitter from a Qatar campus student, ignoring the protesters only twenty feet away. Part way through his response, he paused mid-sentence to read GU Fossil Free’s banner, then responded with “Hmm, okay,” garnering laughs from the audience.
The first in-person question came from the three GU Fossil Free members, who asked Kim for his opinion on divestment.
“By financially linking ourselves to [fossil fuels] through investments in the fossil fuel companies, we link ourselves to the excess of fossil fuels,” one of the members said. “GU Fossil Free … recently met with our board of directors asking them to divest from the top 200 fossil fuel companies in their vote in May. So if you could say anything to the board of directors, what would you say?”
Kim’s response addressed the complexity of divestment, including the necessity of providing energy for poor countries and the nature of commingled funds, which would greatly reduce the university’s endowment if it were to divest.
“[The World Bank is] very exposed to fossil fuels because we’re in the business of trying to create energy for poor people. … There’s not a simple answer to this,” Kim said. “Having run a university before … these are difficult things to do. … These [fossil fuel companies] that you invest in … can be spread over many different funds. … If you were to completely divest from all fossil fuel companies today at Georgetown, the endowment would go down [and] you’re going to have less financing for the programs that support students.”
However, Kim lauded Georgetown students’ efforts in raising awareness about divestment issues.
“I think what you guys have done to force the conversation onto campus is a very good thing and I’m sure President DeGioia would say the same thing,” Kim said.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said that the board of directors will continue to review the issue of divestment. GU Fossil Free members have recently worked with university administrators after developing a proposal requesting that the university divest from the top 200 fossil fuel companies. The Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility voted against GU Fossil Free’s proposal in late January, proposing an alternative solution, which includes targeted divestment and continued assessment of the university’s investments. GU Fossil Free also met with five members of the board of directors in mid-February, and the board will review and discuss GU Fossil Free and CISR’s proposals at its meeting in May.
“The working group of the Board of Directors will be reviewing the divestment question carefully in the coming weeks and will want to hear from key stakeholders, including GU Fossil Free,” Pugh said.
Cipollitti, one of the GU Fossil Free members who stormed on stage, said that she did not intend to criticize Kim.
“We understand that Jim Kim is on our side in terms of wanting to combat climate change and ensuring the well-being of all the world’s people including the most vulnerable, so we are drawing the link between his sentiments and our campaign, to show that they’re fully compatible and the consistent thing to do, if it agrees with Jim Kim’s statements, is to divest from fossil fuels,” Cipollitti said.
Mark Noll (COL ’17), who attended the event, said that he thought Kim gave a comprehensive answer to GU Fossil Free’s question.
“[It] was very well articulated, because divesting is one of many options and it will obviously not solve the problem, and it carries significant financial consequences for the university,” Noll said. “I can see where he’s coming from, cautioning GU Fossil free not to focus solely on this one issue.”
Hannah Gerdes (SFS ’16) said she was unsure as to whether GU Fossil Free’s actions were effective.
“I didn’t see the point … because [Kim] is on stage answering our questions, so I didn’t quite understand why students were holding a sign up of a previous quote of his on stage when he’s actually here in person [and] we can actually ask him [questions],” Gerdes said. “[It] didn’t make complete sense to me,”

OWN IT and the Georgetown Office of Public Affairs hosted the second annual OWN IT Summit Saturday in Gaston Hall. The women’s conference aims to bridge the gap between young women and working professionals in a variety of fields.
Approximately 800 attendees from Georgetown and universities around the country including Yale University, University of Notre Dame and Johns Hopkins University attended the summit, which featured over 80 speakers and panelists.
The Hoya conducted exclusive interviews with five of the speakers. The interviews have been edited for clarity and condensed for print.
Danielle Brooks is an actress who attended The Juilliard School and now plays Tasha “Taystee” Jefferson on the Netflix original series “Orange Is the New Black,” which is in its third season.
What advice would you give young women interested in acting?
Brooks: I say go for it. Go full throttle for it. If you’re still green, get educated. There’s so many schools out here; it doesn’t have to be Juilliard. There are so many colleges that can give you what you need where you are. Go get some education. Educate yourself, and go for it.
How do you think that your character, Taystee, in “Orange Is the New Black” is exposing problems for women in the prison system in America?
Brooks: Taystee, you know, she is a child of the system. She has been in and out of prison her whole life. As we see in season one, I believe, she goes in and out. The reason she does is because in prison she had a home, she had a family, she had food on the table and that was comfortable for her. And that’s a problem that we’re having that, where do these prisoners go for rehabilitation? Where do they go to figure out how to live when they get out? And we don’t have enough of that. So I feel like, that’s really the purpose of Taystee when it comes to talking about the issues of the prison systems in America.
Mary Jordan is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist for the Washington Post who served as a foreign correspondent for 14 years in over 40 countries.
What’s your advice to young women interested in pursuing journalism?
Jordan: Learn how to write. Work hard. Read everything you can, and go for it because there’s never been more opportunities in journalism, actually. There are many more platforms now. You can blog and you can do radio and you can do print journalism. You can do video. There are a lot of places for people who are curious and just know that it’s a fun job. I always feel like it’s grad school. First, I was in Japan and learned everything about Japanese politics, and then I moved to Mexico and learned everything about Latin American studies, then London and learned about the British parliamentary system. I think journalism is so great, because it’s basically just learning every day and meeting really interesting people.
Norah O’Donnell is a print and television journalist who works as the co-anchor of CBS This Morning, and previously worked as the Chief White House Correspondent for CBS News.
What’s the biggest challenge to be a woman in journalism and how would you encourage young aspiring female journalists?
O’Donnell: I think there are very few challenges for women in journalism. I think it’s a great field for women to enter because it’s largely a meritocracy. If you write a good story, if you investigate something and break a news story, that’s going to be recognized. So, I think many of the talents that women have, which are interests in how policy affects people’s lives, answering the question of why something is, which is the heart of journalism. Those are well-suited to some of the skill sets that many women already have and I think journalism is a great field for women. We need more women in leadership in journalism, and that will take time, but I’m firmly convinced that we are at a turning point. Having met many of the women at Georgetown, I’m confident that we are going to have equality in terms of leadership in journalism very soon.
Megan Smith is the chief technology officer to the United States and was formerly the vice president of GoogleX.
What is the role of U.S. Chief Technology Officer and how have you adapted it?
Smith: The official job is to advise the president and his team on how to harness the power on data efficiency in technology on behalf of the nation. It’s a flexible job. It’s not like you’re supposed to run NASA or run IT websites for the government, it’s really an architecture job and a policy job. …
One of the areas we focus on is the American people. How do we help with skills or entrepreneurial access and what people are able to do, STEM stuff for youth and coding at school and that whole range of things to support the American people and top innovators can also help other people get into innovation. We call it “Innovation Nation,” it’s our nickname. Programs like Tech Hire that we launch that are helping people use code boot camps to get into. There’s five million jobs open in the country, so we’re trying to help people get into the tech jobs there.
What advice would you give young women interested in the technology field?
Smith: The universe doesn’t really divide the subjects up. In school you’re learning science, math, and English and history and music. Being fluent in all those different things is very powerful. … As a student, take a lot of time to sample some things and not shut the door because of stereotypes. Even in children’s television they have some crazy stereotypes. Out of every four characters on kid’s TV only one’s a girl. In STEM fields, only one’s a girl out of five, and in computer science cast on TV it’s fifteen to one. Which is not true for the industry, but it creates this bias in what you think you should do. And then you see classes skewed. But coding is just following instructions like following a recipe or following a list of things to do. Learning how to use that to make things and have impact on the world is really important. We sometimes make people afraid of tech. The way that we teach it, we make people feel dumb and bored and not have people teach by learning. You learn to read and write. But when we teach tech stuff, we teach all these facts, we don’t let you discover or make or invent.
Kara Swisher is a technology journalist who serves as the executive editor of Re/Code, a tech news and analysis website.
As moderator of the Innovation Panel at the summit, what were you trying to get across?
Swisher: Innovation can come in many forms and where is it going. And we have to think very hard as to how we can stay as an innovative country. The U.S. is a leader in technology and innovation but it’s going to lose that fast to China and India and countries that are doing some amazing things. The question is, are we educating our people in a way that is necessary to keep that going, are we providing visas in a way to bring in talent from all over the world, do we have enough focus on the fact that this is going to differentiate ourselves and bring us into the future for a better country and a better world.

World Bank Chief Institutional Economist Joel Hellman was selected as the new dean of the School of Foreign Service, blending experience in academia and development practice to steer the school into its second century. Hellman will assume his role July 1.
He will succeed SFS Interim Dean James Reardon Anderson, who assumed the position in November 2013 after Dean Emerita Carol Lancaster (SFS ’64) was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Lancaster died Oct. 22, 2014, at the age of 72.
“We believe that by building on our foundation, Georgetown can make unique contributions in the context of the increasingly complex and interconnected global landscape that we face,” University President John J. DeGioia wrote in a campus-wide email announcing the decision on Tuesday. “As we imagine our future ahead and seek to engage in ever deeper and more meaningful ways with these issues, we look forward to working with Dr. Hellman to lead the SFS into its next hundred years of excellence.
A Fusion of Academia and Practice
Hellman, 52, holds a B.A. from Williams College, a M.Phil. in Russian and East European Studies from the University of Oxford, and a doctorate in political science from Columbia University. He served as a faculty member in the department of political science at Columbia University and in the department of government at Harvard University.
Hellman left his career in academia in 1997 to become a senior political counselor at the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. In 2000, he joined the World Bank, where he initially specialized in the European and Central Asia region, before serving as an adviser in the bank’s Indonesia office. There, he coordinated the World Bank’s response to the 2004 tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia.
After serving in Asia, Hellman assumed the role as the World Bank’s first director for the Global Center on Conflict, Security and Development in 2011. Based in Nairobi, Kenya, and the District of Columbia, Hellman played a large role in managing global development.
Hellman currently serves as the chief institutional economist for the Governance Global Practice at the World Bank, specializing in governance and institutional reform, which he also studied as an academic.
“While we are sad to see Joel leave, this is a remarkable opportunity for him to serve at a distinguished university. I am confident that Joel’s energy, vision and intellect will be put to good service at that venerated institution,” World Bank Governance Global Practice Senior Director Mario Marcel wrote in an email to World Bank staff. “He has long been among the most articulate and visionary staff … and his wit, wisdom and insights will be missed.”
The university is currently collaborating with the World Bank on the two-year Global Futures Initiative. According to Mortara Center for International Studies Director Kathleen McNamara, who served on the selection committee, Hellman also coming from the World Bank was “a happy coincidence.”
SFS Faculty Chair Jeffrey Anderson, who interviewed Hellman and the other final candidates, said that Hellman’s background, which blends practical policymaking experience and academic scholarship, made him an attractive candidate for the position.
“It’s pretty striking how varied and rich his background in international affairs is as a practitioner,” Anderson said. “He also has very strong credentials as an academic. … He made the decision to go into development work, but by the time he left [academia], he established a reputation for academic excellence that is still with him today. For colleagues here in the school, I think they will see him as a wonderful choice on the scholarship front.”
McNamara echoed Anderson, pointing to Hellman’s extensive global knowledge and tangible experience in policy. In the past 20 years, Hellman has worked in over 50 countries and four continents.
“[He has] connections, relationships that he’s built. He spent a lot of time in India, he’s worked in Africa, Asia [and] Latin America,” McNamara said. “As we think about what are the emerging regions in the future: He’s going to have on-the-ground experience — even stature — with groups abroad, having already served so very ably in exactly the sort of places we’re going to be wanting to make sure that we are engaged.”
Vision for the SFS
In 2019, the SFS will celebrate the centennial anniversary of its founding. As the new dean will preside over the school during the occasion, the landmark milestone guided Hellman’s selection. The selection criteria demanded someone with a vision for the school over the next century, according to Provost Robert Groves.
“We wanted someone who could lead and coordinate faculty and staff and student discussions about looking back on the first 100 years and looking forward to the next 100 years of the school and how we can use this fantastic moment in history and really propel the school forward,” Groves said.
The opportunity to consider the future at the 100th anniversary was attractive to Hellman, as well, who saw the centennial as a unique moment to reflect.
“I’m in an enviable position,” Hellman said in an interview with The Hoya. “First, building on a school that already has strengths that are widely recognized but also, because of the centenary, having this opening to really think through what the next 100 years are going to look like or should look like, and what changes need to be made. That doesn’t often come along in the history of most schools.”
When Hellman explained his vision for the direction of the SFS, he emphasized that planning for the future must be a collaborative process.
“What I’m going to do is really reach out to all the different parts of the SFS community and listen to what they think are some of the key issues, some of the key pressures, some of the strengths and what needs to be addressed,” Hellman said. “Obviously, coming in from the outside, I have experiences that I want to share in discussion, but it really has to be based on a collective vision.”
Anderson lauded Hellman as “sending the right signals” about valuing faculty and student input, and Groves concurred.
After participating in conversations with SFS leadership, Hellman said that he primarily wanted to increase levels of collaboration at three different levels: first, between professors of different disciplines on research questions; second, between regional studies programs within the SFS; and third, between the different schools in the university.
“I think there is an openness of everyone I’ve spoken to at Georgetown of thinking more creatively about how [integration] is done in a way that preserves the strengths of the individual programs but also integrates global understanding,” Hellman said. “I think those are things that we will have conversations about with the students, with the faculty, with the staff, and see what possibilities there might be to look for linkages.”
Steven Radelet, chair of the Global Human Development program, which launched in 2014, expected Hellman to continue supporting the exploration of the grand questions of development.
“I suspect that Dean Hellman will continue to support that program, both given his own personal interests in development but also because of the recognition of how important development issues are in the future of the world economy and the world political system,” Radelet said. “It makes sense for the school to continue to build in this direction.”
As a specialist in governance and development, Hellman follows the legacy of Lancaster, who focused on issues of development and poverty reduction throughout her career.
“Carol was beloved by many colleagues here. We are still grieving her absence. She was a wonderful colleague and we miss her. Her great effort, her legacy is connected to programs involving global human development,” Groves said. “If you think about Joel’s work, if you just examine what he has been doing at the World Bank, it is indeed that. In a way, although it wasn’t planned, we have the next dean who, from everything he thinks about and cares about, is really quite consistent with the legacy that Carol left us. I expect good things on that front.”
The Executive Search Committee
The extensive search process for a new SFS dean began in early fall, when DeGioia appointed an executive search committee of 17 individuals, including professors, university officials and undergraduate and graduate students.
Center for Eurasian, Russian and European Studies Director Angela Stent, who also led the 2010 dean search, chaired the committee. The group also included College Dean Chester Gillis, SFS Academic Council President Megan Murday (SFS ‘15) and Program in Science, Technology and International Affairs Director Mark Giordano, among others.
The committee utilized the recruiting and consulting firm Witt/Kieffer, which Georgetown previously used to hire Groves and fill dean vacancies in the School of Continuing Studies and Georgetown University Law Center, to manage the search. Witt/Kieffer members declined to comment on the selection process, as the proceedings remain confidential.
McNamara said that they searched for candidates with tangible academic experience, in addition to real-world practice.
“As a committee, we were certainly very concerned that whichever name we sent up to the president, we made sure all of them understood the DNA of academic life,” McNamara said.
After an initial screening from Witt/Kieffer, the committee conducted preliminary and second-round interviews to narrow the pool to a small group of finalists. Stent said that this smaller group visited the School of Foreign Service campus in Doha, Qatar, but because of the confidentiality of the search process, could not provide details on the number or names of finalists.
Murday, the only undergraduate student on the committee, said that she served to provide a unique perspective during the deliberation process.
“[SFS undergraduates] have a specific set of concerns and a specific set of experiences that no other stakeholders, no other members of the committee have,” Murday said. “So [I was] making sure that not only was the candidate qualified in academic and professional regards, but also qualified as someone who would be there for students.”
After deciding on the list of finalists, the committee sent its top three recommendations to DeGioia and Groves, who both interviewed each candidate individually.
Groves said that he looked for three main attributes: an innovative mind, experience in both worlds of academia and practice and an ability to involve the community in discussions about the future of the SFS.
“President DeGioia and I discussed the three after each of us interviewed the three separately,” Groves said. “We sort of got our heads together and in that capacity, I was sort of advising him with regard to how I absorbed the different search committee input and my own feelings to help him make his decision.”
DeGioia, ultimately, made the final decision after consulting with university leadership and notified Hellman last week. Hellman visited campus Tuesday, the day of the announcement, to meet with faculty and staff.
Transition Process
Hellman currently lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Sharon, and his 18-year-old daughter, Isabel.
“We have two stray cats from Jakarta and one stray dog from Delhi,” Hellman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We live in the Palisades just a few minutes Vespa drive from campus.”
Hellman will assume his position on July 1. He said that he hopes to meet with as many SFS faculty members and various stakeholders as possible in the coming months, a prospect made easier by the proximity of his current job at the World Bank, just a Vespa ride away on Pennsylvania Avenue.
In addition to his responsibilities as dean, Hellman also plans to teach a course on corruption. Reardon-Anderson currently teaches the required Map of the Modern World course, and Lancaster taught a freshman proseminar on ethics and global development while serving as dean.
“I’m very excited about returning to teaching,” Hellman said. “One of the early conversations I want to have with the faculty and the administration is, how quickly can I get back into the classroom?”

The Honorable Omar Abdullah, the former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, delivered his first address at an American university in Gaston Hall on Tuesday. Abdullah discussed his tenure as chief minister and the road forward for the troubled region in his keynote address that closed out the Kashmir Conclave, a series of panel discussions on Kashmir.
The School of Foreign Service Asian Studies Program and the Georgetown-India Dialogue hosted the conclave, which included panels on “Security Concerns,” “Politics and Identity” and “Kashmir’s Importance Today in the India-Pakistan Relationship.”
Abdullah, 44, completed his six-year term as chief minister in December 2014, and is the youngest Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir in the 67-year history of the state. He is currently a Member of the Legislative Assembly and former president of the National Conference Party.
Abdullah comes from a prominent political family; both his grandfather and father both served as chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir.
Berkley Center director and Vice President for Global Engagement Thomas F. Banchoff introduced Abdullah.
Banchoff thanked professor Irfan Nooruddin, the Asian Studies Program, and the Georgetown-India Dialogue for their participation, and spoke about Georgetown’s role in the day of panels.
“We are an institution with strong expertise and robust networks around international issues, and as an institution we are committed to promoting greater understanding and collaboration in the service of the global common good,” Banchoff said.
Abdullah began his talk by expressing his discontent that, after seven decades of skirmishes and protests over India’s and Pakistan’s land claims of Jammu and Kashmir, there is still so much controversy surrounding the area.
“I had hoped long before this that the issue would have been put to rest and that we would be discussing a whole lot of other things with regard to India and Pakistan, but not Jammu and Kashmir,” Abdullah said.
Abdullah focused much of the first part of his talk on explaining the history of the Kashmir land controversy.
“Although it started to be described by various presidents here and other influential people as the most dangerous place in the world, I dare say that perhaps at one point in time it might have been; it certainly isn’t today,” Abdullah said.
Abdullah said that the 1947 partition—when India and Pakistan came into existence — led to a number of issues, especially because Jammu and Kashmir had a Muslim majority and a Hindu ruler.
“Because Jammu and Kashmir is a Muslim majority state, Pakistan felt that it should naturally have been a part of Pakistan, and on the other side India felt that Jammu and Kashmir symbolized what India is supposed to be about, which was a pluralistic, secular society,” Abdullah said.
Jammu and Kashmir decided to stay an independent state following the partition and was subsequently invaded by Pakistani militants whose occupation continue even today in some regions. Despite this, India only agreed to help Jammu and Kashmir if the maharaja, the ruler of India, signed an instrument of accession. This instrument of accession gave India power over the state’s currency, communication, defense and foreign affairs.
Abdullah said that the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution stating that the responsibility was on Pakistan to remove its uniformed nationals from Jammu and Kashmir. After the Pakistani nationals are removed, responsibility is on India to scale back its presence in the contested area so that the people can choose a course of governance.
Abdullah then turned his attention to the future of Jammu and Kashmir and the path to resolving the conflict. Many things have changed since 1947, according to Abdullah. Not only is the Pakistani side of Jammu and Kashmir currently a very different ethnic make-up than it was in the past, but Pakistan has also ceded some of its territory to China.
Abdullah said that because Jammu and Kashmir did not technically merge with India, it cannot be treated on par with other states in the area, and that this is a key aspect of resolving the conflict.
“Militancy in Jammu and Kashmir has had a number of very tragic facets including an almost complete exodus of the Kashmiri Pandit community from Jammu and Kashmir,” Abdullah said.
Abdullah added that democratic and government institutions have almost disappeared, human rights are being denied, and security forces operate with a sense of almost complete immunity from prosecution under the civil courts.
“A solution to Jammu and Kashmir is not going to emerge out of violence, war, or terrorism,” Abdullah said. “After 25 years of militancy and countless deaths in Jammu and Kashmir, but not an inch of territory has moved either towards the west or towards the east.
Although levels of violence in Jammu and Kashmir are almost 80 percent lower than they were in 2000, nothing has changed in terms of the laws giving immunity to security forces. Abdullah called for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate war crimes over the past 25 years.
Abdullah ended his talk by saying that though there are barely any families in Jammu and Kashmir not touched by violence, it is no longer the dangerous place it once was.
“Don’t look at Jammu and Kashmir as the most dangerous place in the world,” Abdullah said. “It isn’t. It certainly is one of the most beautiful places in the world.”
Attendee Gonzalo Figar, a first-year Master of Science in Foreign Service student, said that the Kashmir conflict is one of the most uncontrollable global conflicts and that the world should be involved and concerned.
“The speech was pretty comprehensive and honest on behalf of an Indian politician,” Figar said of the keynote address. “It wasn’t an impartial speech, although of course I didn’t expect it to be. It was of course balanced more towards the Indian point of view, but he did raise some concern about India’s attitude too, so all-in-all it was very interesting.”

Executive Director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State Rev. Barry Lynn, Esq. (LAW ’78) discussed the role of religion in government at an event hosted by the Secular Students Alliance on Thursday night at White-Gravenor Hall.
In the past few decades, Lynn has advocated for the separation of church and state through his position as a minister in the United Church of Christ and various media appearances.
Lynn started the lecture by affirming the separation of church and state as a constitutional value, while noting the scale of religious influence and the discrimination against non-theists in political campaigns.
“I don’t think you should make policies in the United States based on anybody’s understanding of the Holy Scripture,” Lynn said. “We make decisions based on commonly shared values in everyone, so often articulated so well in the Constitution: equal protection under the law, freedom of speech [and] separation of church and state.”
According to Lynn, politicians from earlier periods of American history have advocated for the separation of religion from politics more than current politicians have. For instance, he cited President Ulysses S. Grant’s banning of religious teaching in public schools and President John F. Kennedy’s declaration of the separation of church and state.
“I don’t think there’s any candidate in either political party today, not even sure about the minority parties, who would make a statement like [Kennedy’s] and not fear that he or she would be ostracized and probably defeated for public offices,” Lynn said.
While he conceded America’s high level of religious freedom in comparison to other countries, Lynn said it is challenging to achieve the separation of church and state with 20 percent of the electorate self-identifying with the religious right.
“I think the country today does not have a problem with Christians being subjected to discriminatory treatment,” Lynn said. “It does have a problem with two things. … [One is] inertia, as when something gets started, it’s hard to stop it. The other is momentum.”
Lynn then discussed his involvement with the creation of the Federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. While the FRFRA influenced the ruling of the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. case, Lynn questioned the legal basis for defining corporations as religious.
Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. was a landmark decision that allowed closely held for-profit corporations to be exempt from a law if its owners religiously objected to it.
“I don’t believe it was a reasonable assessment of what this bill [FRFRA] is about, because going through the entire debate, there was no reference to this ever covering corporations except the Church,” Lynn said.
Lynn also questioned the recent events surrounding Memories Pizza in Indiana, which refused to cater a gay wedding under the Public Accommodation Act.
“You just have to be served,” Lynn said. “The service is catering. The service is photographing [an] event. That’s what public accommodation does.”
Lynn said that he was disappointed in President Barack Obama for maintaining the faith-based initiatives and for allowing tax-exempt groups, including churches, to endorse candidates for public office.
“Leaders, I think, are supposed to lead,” Lynn said. “They are supposed to be people who make the arguments that other people can now look up to and not to wait for everybody or the critical mass.”
SSA President Katherine Landau said that Lynn was representative of a larger secular movement beyond Georgetown’s campus.
“It was really good to have that voice from the secular community in D.C.,” Landau said. “As the Secular Students Alliance is gearing more towards the community aspect, giving the atheists a community on campus, it was really good to dig into our roots to hear about those current issues and what he has to say about them. He was a very eloquent speaker.”
SSA member Mallory Vial (COL ’18) said that she enjoyed hearing about Lynn’s perspective and his personal approach to discussing secular issues with students.
“Barry was very engaging and personally interacted with everyone there, even calling us by name,” Vial said. “While Barry lobbies for secular issues, he is also a reverend. As most members of our group identify as non-theists, Barry’s secular but religious perspective was very interesting to hear about.”

The university announced the speakers for the 2015 commencement ceremonies, including United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, journalist Charlie Rose, former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao and global mental health expert Vikram Patel, on May 4.
The ceremonies began Thursday with the McCourt School of Public Policy hosting Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.).
Saturday’s undergraduate commencement ceremonies will begin on Healy Lawn with Ban at 9 a.m. for the School of Foreign Service, followed by Rose for Georgetown College at 12 p.m., Patel for the School of Nursing and Health Studies at 3 p.m. and Chao for the McDonough School of Business at 6 p.m. Each speaker will receive an honorary doctorate.
Ban has been secretary-general since 2007. Ban also spoke at Harvard University’s 2004 commencement while serving as South Korea’s minister of foreign affairs and trade, as well as at the University of Denver’s graduate school commencement in 2013. The U.N. Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General did not respond to requests for comment on the content of Ban’s speech.
Rose, a talk show host and journalist, has hosted his eponymous interview show on PBS since 1993 and has co-anchored “CBS This Morning” since 2012. Rose could not be reached for comment through his program.
College Dean Chester Gillis said that each speaker is welcome to discuss any topic he or she chooses.
“I think that Charlie Rose will speak to the graduates about the privilege and experience of a college, and specifically a Georgetown education, encourage them about their futures and congratulate them,” Gillis wrote in an email. “That said, with all College graduation speakers, the speech is his or hers to create and deliver. I do not specify content.”
Patel, a professor of international mental health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Health and a psychiatrist based in Goa, India, said he will use his vast experience working on global mental health to inform his speech for the NHS graduation.
“Global mental health is really a different way of thinking about mental health care and what mental illness means to ordinary communities,” Patel said. “The field is primarily concerned with notions of equity and fairness in terms of improved opportunities for people with mental illness in all parts of the world, but also in terms of the distribution of resources that are available for mental health care.”
Patel explained that, with this in mind, his talk would be based on two central themes.
“The first theme is about how people with the power of knowledge that comes from higher education should democratize that knowledge by sharing it with other people in the community and to have the humility to learn from other people in the community,” Patel said.
“The second important message is about acting locally, but always thinking globally, to keep your mind open to innovations and approaches to address problems that affect our world.”
The NHS Dean’s Office originally approached Patel to speak at last year’s ceremony, but he was unavailable, and American Association for the Advancement of Science CEO Alan Leshner addressed the graduating class instead.
Patel admitted he was surprised that Georgetown approached him.
“It’s a tremendous honor for me, as an Indian academic,” Patel said. “I know that it’s not common for foreigners to be invited to give this address, and I think it’s a great honor especially given that it’s one of the most world-class universities in the world, especially in the area of health.”
Chao made history in 2001 as the first Asian-American woman to be appointed to a U.S. president’s cabinet, serving as the 24th Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush until 2009. She is also the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
Before entering the political world, Chao held high-ranking positions at Bank of America and Citicorp.
In addition to speaking at this year’s commencement, Chao has attended numerous events at the university in the past, including when she received the Georgetown Business Leader of the Year award in 2001.
Chao praised the university’s commitment to service.
“Georgetown is a wonderful university,” Chao wrote in an email. “The Georgetown tradition of emphasizing leaders dedicated to serving others is an ideal I’ve always believed in and have dedicated most of my career to embody.”
She detailed how her speech will focus on the role of business leaders in the free enterprise system.
“Business leaders should be positive role models, and help shape the image of the free enterprise system by becoming leaders who are ethical and worthy of the public trust who bring hope, employment opportunities and a better life to everyone, their families and communities,” Chao wrote.
MSB Dean David Thomas described meeting Chao shortly after she was appointed as Secretary of Labor and praised her selection to speak at this year’s commencement.
“We shared an interest in the importance of diversity in leadership positions,” Thomas wrote in an email. “She is an inspirational person, and I was happy to nominate her as our speaker this year to the university’s leadership.”
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will host R. Timothy Ziemer, retired Rear Admiral of the United States Navy and U.S. Global Malaria Coordinator. Ziemer will speak Friday, May 15 at 9 a.m. on Healy Lawn.
The speaker for the McDonough School of Business MBA commencement will be President and CEO of the American Red Cross Gail McGovern. She will deliver her address Friday, May 15 at 12:30 p.m. on Healy Lawn.
Friday’s final ceremony will feature the commencement for the School of Continuing Studies. Retired Admiral Thad Allen, executive vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton, will make his remarks on Healy Lawn at 3:30 p.m.
The ceremony for Georgetown University Medical Center will feature remarks from  President and CEO of Trinity Health Richard Gilfillan on Sunday, May 17 at 11 a.m. at the National Theatre.
Stephen Bright, president and senior counsel of the Southern Center for Human Rights, will speak at the Georgetown University Law Center commencement on Healy Lawn Sunday, May 17 at 2 p.m.
Claudia Paz y Paz Bailey, former attorney general of Guatemala and current distinguished scholar in residence at the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and GULC, will receive an honorary doctorate as well.

Global mental health expert Vikram Patel spoke about mental health and health inequality in his address to the Class of 2015 at the commencement ceremony for the School of Nursing and Health Studies this afternoon.
University President John J. DeGioia presented Patel with a degree of Doctor of Science prior to his speech.
Patel began by highlighting his connection to Georgetown as a Jesuit institution, noting that he was trained at Jesuit schools for the first twelve years of his education.
“It just shows how connected we all are, even though it may not seem that way at first,” Patel said.
Patel then spoke about mental health issues, which he said include a range of problems including autism, intellectual disabilities, depression, drug and alcohol abuse and dementia, in developing countries.
While low and middle-income countries hold about 80 percent of the world’s population, they only posses about 10 to 15 percent of the world’s mental health resources.
Patel said that while these countries lack resources to deal with most health problems, mental health issues can be particularly damaging for individuals.
“For people with mental health problems, there is an additional challenge that they face, and of course that is the enormous stigma that is attached to mental problems, and that is unique to mental health problems,” Patel said.
According to Patel, about 90 percent of people who suffer from poor mental health do not receive proper care – a problem that he attributes to the failure of governments and donors to invest in resources to address these issues.
Patel, a professor of international mental health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Health and a psychiatrist based in Gao, India, said that his principle achievement has been empowering ordinary people to provide social and psychological interventions for mental disorders.
“I believe that we have affected a paradigm shift from thinking about places as being under resourced to being richly resourced,” Patel said. “Because the single most important resources that we need for mental health care, indeed for any kind of health care, is a human being with compassion. And I do not believe that there is any community anywhere in this world in which there aren’t people who care for other people.”
Patel said that in the challenge of figuring out how to best use these human resources, he puts ideology on par with science.
“In my view, ideology and science are inseparable bedfellows when it comes to global health or public health. To address the health issues that we talk about … in the unequal societies that we live in, we must adopt an ideology,” Patel said. “For me, the ideology that certainly is relevant for Asia and Africa, the two parts of the world that I know best, … is that health cannot be considered a private commodity.”
In order to deal with the issues of global mental health and health inequality, Patel left students with two guiding principles.
Patel encouraged students to adhere to the principle of the democratization of knowledge.
“I firmly believe that it is only when you give up that knowledge to those who don’t have it that you will actually finally achieve the goals you aspire to,” Patel said.
Secondly, Patel said that students should be mindful of both local and global needs.
“When you act, act thinking about local needs, but by guided by and always keep a mind on the world around you,” Patel said.
Patel closed by reiterating the interconnectedness of the global community.
“We are not only very interconnected as a world in terms of all the problems that vex our world, such as climate change and the massive migrations of people leaving economic and environment insecurity, but also in terms of the solutions that lie ahead of these challenges,” Patel said.
Following Patel’s speech, the graduates received their diplomas, beginning with Blake Meza (NHS ’15), the recipient of the NHS dean’s medal.

Sri Lankan Ambassador to the United States Prasad Kariyawasam expressed his optimism for political and economic reform in his country at a speech in the Intercultural Center on Wednesday night.
The event, titled “Sri Lanka: A Tale of a Resilient Democracy,” was organized by the Asian Pacific Forum and the Asian Studies Program.
Asian Studies professor Irfan Nooruddin, who moderated the event, said that Kariyawasam’s speech is an example of the School of Foreign Service’s growing interest in the South Asian region.
“[The visit] is part of a broader agenda to build the presence of South Asia in the SFS,” Nooruddin said. “Some say South Asia has been neglected in most conversations. … But the ambassador’s visit is a step in the right direction to bringing its issues and importance to the forefront of discussion.”
Kariyawasam served as Sri Lanka’s diplomat to India, Saudi Arabia and Switzerland before becoming ambassador to the United States. Throughout the discussion, he provided examples from his political career to explore a wide variety of topics.
Kariyawasam began by stressing the importance of democratization in Sri Lanka.
“Democracy is a work in progress, and it was hard to say our government was democratic,” Kariyawasam said. “Sri Lankans decided … to go through with a free and fair election, and the democratic institutions were strengthened.”
Sri Lanka, which gained its independence in 1948 after 150 years of British rule, is the oldest democracy in Asia. Since it became independent, the country endured a 25-year civil war between the government and minority ethnic groups.
Kariyawasam said that although the conflict ended in 2009, the government still faces significant challenges in overcoming its history of oppression.
“[The] last government was authoritarian and operated with impunity,” Nooruddin said. “Yet the mood has moved from pessimism to optimism with the revitalization of democratic principles. Sri Lanka is once again a bright spot for democracies.”
As the conversation progressed, Kariyawasam addressed Sri Lanka’s improving relationship with the United States. In September, both countries agreed to draft a resolution that would focus on post-civil war reconciliation efforts in Sri Lanka.
However, the ambassador said that the relationship between the two nations has not always been favorable.
“There were many areas of dissonance in the relationship, especially in the areas of human rights,” Kariyawasam said. “Since the elections, we are increasingly on the same page.”
Kariyawasam said that Sri Lanka is also positioning itself to continue strong economic growth. The country’s gross domestic product growth rate has remained above 6.5 percent since 2009, a higher rate than those of India and Pakistan.
According to Kariyawasam, the Sri Lanka’s positioning as a trade hub is important to its economic prosperity and international relationships. Seventy percent of the world’s oil passes through the region, providing incentive for Sri Lanka, India and China to strengthen their relations.
“We are in the intersection of a power play with world commerce and world powers,” Kariyawasam said. “Our partnerships and the liberalizations of our economy will only allow for further prosperity.”
Amanda Zhu (MSB ’17) said she was unaware of the country’s recent social, political and economic progress prior to Kariyawasam’s speech.
“Sri Lanka is usually talked about tangentially in relationship to China and India,” Zhu said. “But people should be paying attention to it more. The shift into a more democratic government is a success story, but so are its economic and political developments. Its regional importance will only expand.”
Yohan Senarath (SFS ’17), a student in the Asian Studies Program, said Kariyawasam is one of the most effective political operators and commentators in Sri Lanka.
“I find him to be an oxymoron in the world of diplomacy. He is genuine, insightful and incisive when it comes to providing sharp analysis on the relevant issues,” Senarath said. “These qualities are what make the ambassador one of the most respected diplomats working today.”
Senarath said that he hoped the conversation will change commonly held perceptions about Sri Lanka.
“Most Americans consider Sri Lanka a noteworthy country, but not at the level of importance that is shared by actual policymakers,” Senarath said. “You are only likely to see the nation feature more prominently as future issues centered within the region continue to play out.”

Prominent Buddhist monk, author, photographer and humanitarian Matthieu Ricard shared his insights on the importance of human happiness and altruism to an audience of more than 300 people in Gaston Hall on Monday.
The former molecular biologist turned monk visited Georgetown as part of a global promotional tour for his latest book, “Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World.”
Ricard is renowned for his 2004 TED talk on happiness and altruism that has garnered more than 7 million views. He also participates in scientific research related to contemplation and founded the charitable organization Karuna-Shechen in 2000, which is currently committed to more than 140 humanitarian projects throughout Nepal, India and Tibet.
In University President John J. DeGioia’s opening remarks, he cited a quotation — “The world is our house” — from Jerome Nadal, a 16th-century member of the Society of Jesus, and said that altruism aligns with Georgetown’s Jesuit mission.
“This idea that the world is our house asks that we embrace a way of life that is welcoming, accepting and in solidarity with all those around us,” DeGioia said. “It asks that we take responsibility for the well-being of each other.”
Ricard began by offering his personal definition of altruism.
“[In] altruism … your primary motivation is to achieve the benefit of others or to remove their suffering,” Ricard said. “So altruism basically is a state of mind, it’s a motivation and an intention. Of course, it must be followed by action as much as possible.”
Ricard also said that he believes in what he calls “the banality of goodness,” which he defined as the view that all people are essentially good and behave well toward others.
“I think that we have to recognize that if we look at the vast majority of the behavior of 7 billion human beings most of the time … we behave in benevolent, decent, kind, polite and … cooperative ways,” Ricard said.
Ricard said that humanity currently faces many problems including widespread poverty, inequality and globalized environmental degradation.
“We are clearly facing major challenges,” Ricard said. “Here, we are at the edge of tipping points in many ways: our own life, societal life, inequalities that are growing throughout our cities and countries and the environment.”
Ricard also said that in his view, altruism is a practical solution to the problems that humanity faces in the modern world.
“The idea [of altruism] is not just a utopian, beautiful idea, but is the most pragmatic answer to challenges of our times,” Ricard said.
According to Ricard, widespread altruism could help overcome the world’s challenges by altering cultures, institutions and economies to achieve what he calls “sustainable harmony.”
“Sustainable harmony for today is [about] remediating … inequalities — [to bring about] more social justice,” Ricard said. “Sustainable harmony over time is to remain in harmony with our environment so that we continue in a sustainable way for the sake of future generations.”
Ricard said that to cause such far-reaching change, altruism must first be cultivated at the individual level through exercises such as meditation on compassion for others. According to Ricard, modern research indicates that meditation changes the structure and function of a practitioner’s brain, even to the level of gene expression, making them more amenable to compassion.
“If you cultivate the innerskill of love and compassion, definitely, you change,” Ricard said.
Ricard also said that a close-knit group of altruistic individuals could unite to change the community around them. Ricard said that this idea is based on the principle that only the smallest proportion is needed to effect change in a larger whole.
“It turns out that to reach opinion, you don’t need 90 percent of people or more than 50 to adopt an idea,” Ricard said. “If there is a strong idea with, say, 15 percent of people, who really make it the point. … Those who are undecided will shift to that and there is a change in culture.”
After Ricard’s keynote, the event included a conversation moderated by associate professor of psychology Abigail Marsh, a question-and-answer session and a book signing.
Daniel Marshall (SFS ’19) said the event was thought-provoking and inspired personal reflection.
“It was a totally distinctive point of view, which took me by surprise, and as a result I know I have some re-evaluating to do,” Marshall wrote in an email to The Hoya.
 
[…] I have been moved to tears by some of the anecdotes and information.  Ricard talks about the “banality of goodness”.  “We have to recognize that if we look at the vast majority of the behavior of 7 billion […]

University President John J. DeGioia and the board of directors approved the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation’s recommendation to rename Mulledy Hall and McSherry Hall on Saturday, one day after student activists began their sit-in outside the Office of the President.
The group changed the names of both Mulledy Hall and McSherry Hall to the interim names of Freedom Hall and Remembrance Hall, respectively.
The retention of the name of Mulledy Hall sparked controversy earlier this semester, calling attention to the actions of Fr. Thomas Mulledy, S.J., who authorized the sale of 272 slaves to a Louisiana plantation in 1838 while serving as the Maryland provincial of Jesuits; Mulledy would later serve as university president. McSherry Hall is named after then-University President Fr. William McSherry, S.J., who served as Mulledy’s lawyer during the sale.
“We are grateful to the Working Group on Slavery, Memory and Reconciliation; to students, including the Black Leadership Forum and other student groups on campus; and to other members of our community for their thoughtful engagement in these important, and sometimes challenging conversations,” DeGioia wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
According to a letter attached to a university-wide email sent at 5 p.m. on Saturday, DeGioia met with several student activists Friday morning outside his office, then received a recommendation from the working group to change the names of the two halls. The university’s board of directors approved the recommendation electronically on the same day.
“As a university, we are a place where conversations are convened and dialogue is encouraged, even on topics that may be difficult,” DeGioia wrote in a university-wide email. “This is what we will continue to do at Georgetown. We are supportive of our students and proud of the depth of their engagement in these urgent conversations.”
Student activists began staged a sit-in outside the president’s office from 9 a.m. to midnight Friday. The activists intended to continue staging daily sit-ins until the administration met their demands, but they temporarily halted the sit-ins Monday in light of the name change. The group has not announced further plans, but encouraged activists to “not lose momentum” on the Facebook event page of the demonstration.
Latazia Carter (COL ’17), who attended the sit-in, emphasized that student activists were acting in response to a lack of recognition and responsiveness by the Georgetown administration.
“I don’t want this to seem like a new movement, because it’s not,” Carter said. “But we’ve had to take this action because the university fails to hear us and recognize our thoughts on the matter.”
BLF member Crystal Walker (SFS ’16), who is a member of the working group, said that she is pleased by DeGioia’s decision to approve the name change.
“I am content with the provisional names of the two buildings and look forward to the final name change, as it will directly commemorate the lives of the 272 enslaved people who were sold,” Walker wrote in an email to The Hoya.
This activism comes in response to recent allegations of racial injustice on college campuses worldwide.
These accusations resulted in the resignation of University of Missouri President Tim Wolfe after he was criticized for failing to address issues of racial intolerance and outrage at Yale University over comments on offensive Halloween costumes and racial insensitivity by university faculty. As a show of solidarity, around 250 students, faculty and community members attended a demonstration hosted by black student activists in Red Square on Thursday.
At the event, members of the BLF announced demands, including revising university tours to include information on the history of campus sites, placing plaques on the known unmarked graves of slaves, establishing an annual program focused on education, creating an endowment for recruiting black professors equivalent to the net present value of the profit from the 1838 sale and mandatory training for professors on diversity and identity issues.
In September, DeGioia charged a working group of 16 students, faculty and alumni to address the history and ramifications of Jesuit slaveholding at Georgetown. The group is chaired by history professor Rev. David Collins, S.J.
After the board approved the working group’s recommendation, Collins said he would have rather kept to the original schedule for the name change instead of responding quickly to last week’s demonstrations. “I wish we could have kept to our timeline … to vote on a resolution after we had had a university-wide conversation,” Collins wrote in an email to The Hoya. “There are multiple stakeholders in our university. As my email inbox shows, a lot of them wish that we had had time to involve them in a larger conversation.”
However, Collins said he recognized the importance of incorporating the views of the entire Georgetown community and accoutning for the risk of community members feeling uninformed when contemplating the name change.
“We made the decision very clearly that the situation … is a signal to us that it’s important for us to pass this resolution today and to risk all the complications that this is going to cause with other segments of the community that aren’t as familiar with why this is so important,” Collins said. “The BLF and the student groups made a compelling case … that we need to pass the resolution now rather than several months from now.”
The Georgetown department of philosophy also published a letter in support of the Black Leadership Forum’s protests Friday, urging the halls’ name changes, the memorialization of the graves of slaves on campus and an annual educational program on Georgetown’s slaveholding past.
In its recommendation to DeGioia, the working group said it found its values to be consistent with those of black student activists.
“We are very encouraged by and welcome the suggestions of the Black Leadership Forum and other students,” the group wrote. “Their words are shaped by a thoughtfulness, a passion and a spirit of constructive engagement that we appreciate deeply and hope will sustain us through the course of this important and painful conversation about our history and its legacy.”
The group said they proposed the names “Freedom Hall” and “Remembrance Hall” to memorialize the experiences of slaves who helped to build the two buildings in the early 19th century.
In the letter, the group also announced three events to continue dialogue on campus, including a symposium on the history of slaveholding at Georgetown on April 16, a holiday recognized by the District of Columbia as Emancipation Day.
The group will also host two conversation circles next Wednesday and Thursday and a teach-in Dec. 1. Both will take place in the Healey Family Student Center. The teach-in will involve an academic discussion not limited to a certain viewpoint or frame of topic on the issue of Georgetown’s slaveholding past.
According to Office of the President Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara, the working group plans to engage in dialogue with the Georgetown community to find permanent names for Freedom and Remembrance Halls.
“The Working Group will continue to engage our community in dialogue. Through this process of dialogue, the intended timeline is to identify recommended permanent names sometime during the spring semester,” Ferrara wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Collins emphasized the importance of getting as close to a unanimous consensus as possible from different stakeholders in the community, such as alumni and faculty, when suggesting permanent names for the halls.
“Some stakeholders are harder to get onboard than others,” Collins said. “We want everybody to be onboard. You never get unanimity. The working group is prepared to deal with the lack of unanimity.”
Collins said that while some community members have contacted the group in disagreement with the name change, he has not received any racially charged rhetoric.
“I have gotten no email that’s racist,” Collins said. “I have gotten a lot of emails between accusing us of working too hastily [and] for not listening to all the folks who are out there.”
The movement to change the names of both halls sparked the creation of a working group at the College of the Holy Cross, where Mulledy served as its first university president starting in 1843 after leaving Georgetown and where a residence hall is named in his honor. In a letter to the university community, College of the Holy Cross University President Rev. Philip L. Boroughs, S.J., outlined the need to examine Holy Cross in a similar way as Georgetown.
“Since the fall, I have been following the progress of Georgetown’s working group, and have been in conversations with some of our alumni, faculty, and staff about these same issues,” Boroughs wrote. “While our historical situation differs somewhat from that of Georgetown, I believe we too must investigate what this issue means for us today.”
According to Connor Maytnier (COL ’17), who serves on the working group, the temporary renaming to Freedom and Remembrance Halls is the first step in a long process to address the history of slaveholding at Georgetown.
“While the renaming of the buildings is by no means an insignificant step, it is just one piece of a more in-depth process,” Maytnier wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I hope that we can continue to engage with folks across our community and promote dialogue on a number of fronts … such as how to best acknowledge Georgetown’s history with slavery, and steps that can be taken to memorialize and reconcile that history.”
Collins said student input in the naming process is essential to formulating representative permanent names for Freedom and Remembrance Halls.
“The creativity of coming up with a new name — that’s your responsibility. … How about if groups were to get together and engage in some kind of [project] … and out of that were to emerge a word, a name, a concept on how to name the building?” Collins said. “Georgetown students are some of the smartest students in America, and some of the most creative. … What ideas are you going to come up with?’”

Wait till these coddled Sociology majors find out Washington D.C was named after a slave owner too. Will they stage a sit-in at the capitol lawn? Racial discrimination and slavery are an unfortunate reality in this country–there’s absolutely no denying that. But to raise such a fuss about the NAMES of two buildings is absurd. Especially at a place like Georgetown, where–frankly–race is not an issue. How about we focus our efforts in protesting the rising costs of a Georgetown education? Or push for greater awareness and support of rape survivors (or did we forget about Willa already?) And lest we forget that Georgetown opened its doors to us, gave us a stellar financial aid package and all of the support we could possibly need to thrive here. We minorities are in no position to “demand” anything from a university that has given us so much already.

Terrific idea – in fact I have a few more name changes.  I also suggest the University burn any archives that mention their names. 
Riggs – financed the Mexican-American War
Edmund Walsh – proponent of McCarthyism
Carroll – supported slavery
Copley, White, Gravenor – early missionaries contributing to early conquest of the Indians
Lauinger Library- represents American imperialism and aggression in Vietnam
Georgetown – named after George II – personified Catholic and Irish bigotry
Washington, slave owner
DC – named after Columbus
Of course, we should no longer be known as a Catholic school since Catholic priests have molested children and the Jesuits have some terrible chapters in their history as well. Oh, you better remove gray as an official color – although chosen to represent peace after the Civil War, it is a symbol of the Confederacy and must go.  Maybe the school in Qatar is not such a great idea.  Slavery in the 21st century does not reflect GU’s values.

Georgetown accepted 13 percent of its early action applicants to the Class of 2020 this past week, an acceptance rate consistent with that of the last several years.
The university mailed acceptance letters to 892 of a record-high 7,027 applicants Friday, marking an early action acceptance rate equal to the 13 percent for the Class of 2019.
“In my opinion this has been the most diverse and the most talented pool we’ve seen,” Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon said.
About one-third of the expected 20,000 total applicants for the Class of 2020 applied early action. Georgetown expects to offer admission to about 3,200 students to complete a class of 1,600, according to Deacon.
Deacon emphasized that the university aims to keep the acceptance rate for early action below that of regular decision, as the early action pool generally comprises more privileged students.
“We don’t want to over-admit early, because the early pool tends to be slightly more advantaged. We want to give everybody a fair chance and are also looking for diversity,” Deacon said.
The admissions committee accepted applicants from 48 states and 38 foreign countries. Nine percent of admitted students are African-American, 10 percent are Hispanic, 14 percent are Asian-American and 1 percent is American Indian. Seven percent of international students were offered admission.
Deacon highlighted the ongoing trend of increased diversity in the early action pool and said that this pattern is projected to continue in the coming years.
“Every year it’s getting slightly more diverse, and looking down the pipeline, even more change is coming,” Deacon said. “Historically, a declining majority of the applicant pool has been white students every year. That’s getting down close to 50-50. If you were to go back 20 years, it would be 75 to 80 percent. As the pool is going down in white students it’s going up in other students, so the diversity is continuing to increase.”
Deacon also said the university’s continued use of an application separate from the Common Application has led to a smaller applicant pool, from which the admissions office is able to draw information about students in a more individualized way.
“By not accepting the Common Application, we actually get a pool of students we know more about, when they answer our questions,” Deacon said. “Our pool of 20,000 could be a lot larger if we did [accept the Common Application] but we wouldn’t know as much about them, and we might accept different people.”
The Walsh School of Foreign Service admitted 207 of 1,434 applicants, an acceptance rate of 14 percent. The other three undergraduate schools each welcomed 12 percent of applicants. Georgetown College accepted 481 of 3,917 students, the McDonough School of Business admitted 143 of 1,178 and the School of Nursing and Health Studies accepted 61 of 498.
The average admitted student was in the top 2 percent of his class, with average SAT scores of 690-780 and 700-770 in critical reading and math, respectively.
Deacon emphasized the positive components of this year’s early action pool, particularly focusing on increasingly exceptional applicants and growing diversity.
“We’re getting an ever-increasing share of the high-ability schools, at the same time as diversity. It’s a nice combination for Georgetown,” Deacon said.
Early action applicants that were not accepted are deferred to the regular decision pool and will receive notification of final decisions April 1. All accepted students will have until May 1 to commit to the Class of 2020.

Benjamin Bryant (GRD ’17) was one of 60 former or active military members in 2015 to be awarded a prestigious Pat Tillman Scholarship for his pre-medical school coursework.
The academic scholarship funds recipients’ degrees, covering not only direct tuition expenses, but also other needs including housing and child care. It was created in 2004 to honor the legacy of Pat Tillman, a star defensive back for the Arizona Cardinals who voluntarily left the National Football League after the Sept. 11 attacks to join the military and was killed in Afghanistan.
“Our program unites the best talent and leadership in the military to make a significant impact in the fields of medicine, law, business, policy, technology, education and the arts,” the Pat Tillman Foundation website reads. “The Tillman Scholars program supports our nation’s active-duty service members, veterans and military spouses by investing in their higher education.”
Bryant did not always dream of becoming a doctor. He enlisted in the Army shortly after graduating from high school in Indiana and was later admitted to the United States Military Academy. But as Bryant was preparing to graduate from West Point in 2007, his older brother and role model was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
“My older brother, he’s kind of perfect,” Bryant said. “He was already a major in the Army, and a general’s aide, and just doing great things.”
Bryant identified his brother’s diagnosis as the first turning point that drew him to health care. The next came in 2009, when Bryant was deployed to Iraq as a field artillery officer in the 10th Mountain Division and came into regular contact with Army doctors.
“I went to Iraq and I saw how well the health care community took care of any of our injured soldiers. They’re really pretty phenomenal,” Bryant said.
While deployed in Iraq, Bryant began following the health care reform debate that was raging back in the United States as newly inaugurated President Barack Obama placed health care at the top of the national agenda. Bryant paid close attention to the intense public scrutiny placed on the Affordable Care Act, and his fascination led him to decide to make the career switch to health care and apply to Georgetown University’s School of Nursing and Health Studies.
Not only was Bryant admitted to the Master of Science in Health Systems Administration Program, he was also awarded the Tillman Scholarship and then accepted to a one-year pre-medical certificate program. Bryant attributed his success to his start in the master’s program.
“I didn’t think I had the academic chops to do it, but being in that program gave me a lot of confidence,” Bryant said. “I did very well in it and I just thought, you know, I should try out and see if I can get into the pre-med program.”
After finishing his pre-medical coursework, Bryant will complete his master’s while applying to medical schools. Though the master’s is not necessary for medical school, Bryant aims to continue learning about the complexities of the health care system and ways to address its problems.
Bryant said that he plans to use his combined master’s and medical degree to return to the military or the Veterans Administration to care for soldiers and veterans.
“I don’t think I would be content with just being a doctor in the hospital,” Bryant said. “In my master’s program I really got a good look at the state of the health care system. There is a lot of evidence out there that what we need is a lot more general practitioners. We need family doctors and a lot of people that can take care of a lot of people instead of specialists that can only do one little thing.”
Science in health systems administration professor Ryung Suh (MED ’98, GRD ’98, GRD ’03), a mentor to Bryant, recommended him for the scholarship. Suh is a fellow graduate of West Point and a combat veteran who was the task force surgeon in Kandahar, Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom when Tillman was killed.
“I was honored to recommend Benjamin for the Tillman Scholarship,” Suh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He reads broadly, thinks critically and is preparing himself for a range of future contributions to the health care industry — as a clinician and as a health executive. He embodies the spirit of Georgetown, preparing himself to serve others in the world and constantly seeking opportunities for intellectual, spiritual and moral growth.”
Even though Bryant spends his days taking classes with Georgetown undergraduates, he serves as a captain in the Maryland National Guard on reserve duty. Last year, he left Georgetown in the midst of finals and deployed to Baltimore in the wake of the Freddie Gray protests.
Bryant still has a long road ahead of him before he becomes a doctor, but he said that he is currently focused on working hard and making the most of the opportunity the Pat Tillman Foundation has given him.
“I really want to do well,” Bryant said. “I want to show them that they made the right decision in supporting me.”

Former Pakistani Ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani advocated for an overhaul of ideologies and paradigms within Pakistan, including the ways Pakistanis study and learn their history as well as their relationship with Islam, in a panel discussion titled “Reimagining Pakistan” held in the Mortara Center for International Studies on Wednesday.
Along with Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, a member of the ruling Qatari royal family, Professor in the History of Islam Tamara Sonn and Professor Christine Fair, the ambassador highlighted ways to confront the ideologies fueling instability within Pakistan and the surrounding region.
Haqqani was exiled from Pakistan in 1999 following his criticisms against the government. He then taught as a professor at Boston University from 2004 to 2008 before serving as Pakistan’s Ambassador to the U.S. in 2008. He resigned after pressure from officials in Pakistan, who alleged the ambassador attempted to solicit support from the U.S. military if a military coup took place in Pakistan. He left Pakistan in 2012 and has not returned since.
Haqqani’s remarks first focused on the ways extreme Islamic ideology continues to plague Pakistan’s own population as well as the country’s stability.
Haqqani said Islam — once a uniting force following Pakistan’s independence in 1947 — has been utilized by leaders in Pakistan to exert control over regions and ethnic groups within the nation.
“Islamic ideology has been used essentially to be able to perpetuate the ethnic domination of groups instead of uniting a federation of partners,” Haqqani said. “Pakistan needs to morph into a more fair federation that accepts its diversity instead of insisting that we will try to create one nation by enforcing everything from the top.”
Many minority groups within the country have suffered from such domination, particularly Ahmadi Muslims. Ahmadis belong to a specific sect of Islam, but officials within Pakistan consistently oppress the group. When filing official documentation, other Pakistanis are required to denounce Ahmadis as well.
“Every Pakistani who applies for a passport as a Muslim, in order to perform a pilgrimage to Mecca, is required to sign a declaration that disavows Ahmadi beliefs and disavows them as Muslims,” Haqqani said. “Instead of uniting, [religion] has become a divisive factor.”
Later in the discussion, Sonn noted Haqqani’s desire to see religious ideology move out of the Pakistani legislature. She raised questions as to whether it was Islam itself that contributed to the suffering of minorities or if it was the way religion played out in public discussion.
“In particular, your proposition is that it is very important for Pakistan to give up its ideological paradigm when it comes to [Islam],” Sonn said. “Could it not be said that there would be a reimagining of public discourse about Islam [instead]?
Haqqani said the Pakistani state continues to see competition with India as one of the primary purposes of its existence. He argued that the government and leaders are obsessed with establishing dominance over India, though such thinking is unsustainable.
“Does [Pakistan] want to be a country that derives its pride from the size of its nuclear arsenal, or are we going to derive pride from having a nation that actually looks after its people?” Haqqani asked. “Pakistan cannot achieve any of that until it ends this perennial competition it has with our much larger neighbor [India].”
Fair reiterated this point during her own remarks. She said it is important to explore how to deal with such misbeliefs and fallacies in light of the Internet, journalism and public discourse.
“Pakistani textbooks and media keep claiming that India has started every war and Pakistan has won every war,” Fair said. “So what accounts for this enduring accumulation of fiction that so many Pakistanis rehearse in their curriculum and elsewhere as fact, despite empiricism? How do you puncture the bubble of nonsense?”
One method for changing such views and ideology lies in revisiting the ways Pakistanis are taught about their history and their national identity. Haqanni advocated for changing the ways Pakistani citizens view themselves in relation to the world.
“The reimagined Pakistan would tell our young people that you are Pakistanis because you were born in a country called Pakistan … Surely Pakistan can revisit its own history and say ‘We did something wrong somewhere and this is how we can change it’ and that is what I think is needed,” Haqqani said.
Moez Hayat (SFS ’19), who is ethnically Pakistani and attended the event, said the ambassador’s comments reflected ideas that were too dismissive of the idea of Islam as a uniting force.
“As a Pakistani and as a Muslim, I found this conversation interesting, but unhelpful at its best and insulting at its worst,” Hayat said. “While everyone agrees many of Pakistan’s problems lie with its military and security institutions, the idea that Pakistan as an idea should be changed is laughable.”
Hayat said instead that Islam should be a unifying factor in Pakistan.
“No matter how many times it fails, the actual idea of Pakistan will always be just,” Hayat said. “The idea of Pakistan as a state based in Islam is part of the solution, not part of the problem. The idea of Pakistan may need repair, but it does not need to be reimagined.”
Ali Rehman (COL ’17) also disagreed with some of Haqqani’s specific ideas, though she said she appreciated his efforts to spur progressive thinking among Pakistani communities both in America and in Pakistan.
“He presented a more progressive view, something a lot of my friends [from Pakistan] discuss here in the U.S.,” Rehman said. “While some of his viewpoints may not be agreeable, they are still good starting ground for the future of Pakistan and the improvement of the [Pakistani] people.”

Georgetown University Women of Color hosted its annual “Race at Georgetown” dialogue in an effort to discuss issues of race and diversity within the larger campus community in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Tuesday night.
The event was held in conjunction with the “What’s a Hoya?” initiative, focusing on freshman participation, and involved polling and panelists. Approximately 120 audience members were present and able to openly voice their own opinions and questions.
GUWOC is an organization dedicated to providing women of color a space to both gather and network with one another, in addition to providing a platform for the discussion of race and ethnicity.
According to GUWOC Outreach Chair Courtney Maduike (SFS ’17), the event’s theme was “Are You Woke?” The phrase, slang for being socially aware, emphasizes the importance of bridging divides through greater dialogue and awareness.
“I think it’s just the awareness and the fact that the theme for the event for this year is “‘Are You Woke?’”, Maduike said. “It’s this awareness and consciousness that being sympathetic and sensitive to these topics, and building this sense of solidarity and community across these kind of categorizations.”
The event began with opening remarks from moderators Maduike and GUWOC Treasurer Ashlie Williams (MSB ’17), in addition to a video of Yale University students protesting their community’s racial injustices and allegations of discrimination.
Following the video, student panelists Ayo Aruleba (COL ’17), Asha Thanki (SFS ’17), Gilda Gallardo (COL ’17) and Tanner Davis (SFS ’17) presented to the audience their own views on race relations at Georgetown as well as their perspectives on ways for students to enhance the ongoing dialogue.
 
“Working closely with communities of color, but also as a leader, I would say communities of color are trying to bridge the gap,” Aruleba said. “In order to bring sides together, to bring a more inclusive Georgetown community, it’s going to take not only communities of color talking about race. I think everyone has to come to the table.”
Davis emphasized how he became active in dialogue dealing with issues of race and the treatment of minorities after returning from studying abroad.
“I was never really conscious of my race or my whiteness until I studied abroad in [India], and I was a minority there for four months as a white person,” Davis said. “Getting stared at, getting looked at and feeling uncomfortable in social situations, and coming back here after having that experience has really shaped the way I understand how a minority might feel.”
Over the course of the discussion, GUWOC also used a polling system that allowed audience members to answer questions from their phones. Their answers would then subsequently appear on the projector screen in a word cloud with the most popular answers enlarged.
The addition of polling to the overall discussion was part of a broader effort to make sure the dialogue incorporated as much student opinion as possible. Davis explained that discussions on issues of race and discrimination do not happen as often as they should because people can see such dialogues as difficult.
“Having these conversations never really happened in any campus organization I’ve been a part of since I’ve been here,” Davis said. “And when they have, we would talk to each other like ‘This makes us uncomfortable, we don’t want to be talking about this.’”
The panelists continued to explore their own relationship with race-related dialogue, with Gallardo giving an anecdote on how she was treated during a rally in Red Square in November, which called for the name changes of former Mulledy and McSherry Halls, now known as Freedom and Remembrance Halls, respectively.
Gallardo explained how, during a time when students were invited to speak into the microphone and give their own views during the rally, she encountered pushback and criticism.
“I had been the object of critique in one of the classes because I had gone up [to the mic] when they invited people to come forward and share their experiences as minorities with race. The critique was that was not my place or my time to share that experience,” Gallardo said. “I thought that was interesting, but at the same time that invitation was for everybody to share their experiences.”
A student in the audience asked how others could stand with minorities and those facing racial discrimination simply by being active on social media. Aruleba said it is critical for students to read from experts and writers who continue to comment on the issues facing minorities today.
“Especially in this age where there are a lot of movements going on, I would encourage people to do reading on the topics because a part of the movement is being woke,” Aruleba said. “The best advocates of racial justice and the best people to talk on these issues are those who understand, so it’s important to read the discourse on what’s really going on, especially with these issues.”
Thanki said students should move past social media activism by creating tangible change in their communities.
“You can post a status update and still be totally ignorant to the injustices that you see in the world around you,” Thanki said. “So post a status update if you want to, but then take a moment, look around you and see what else you need to do.”
Thanki added that simple acts and efforts on the part of individuals can make significant progress when it comes to assisting those affected by an issue.
“Listen, be genuine and care,” Thanki said. “Those things are so simple-sounding, but the only way to be a true ally, no matter what context, is to hear what people are asking of you instead of not just deciding for yourself what is being asked of you.”
Afras Sial (COL ’19), who attended the event, said he has been involved in dialogues dealing with issues of race and discrimination in the past, but appreciated the value in holding such conversations for those not engaged in the issues.
“I was expecting it to be more structured, for them to have topics specific to Georgetown instead of small anecdotes and large themes,” Sial said. “I didn’t get any new information out of it personally, but it was helpful for people who have not been exposed to the topic before.”
Deniz Yuksel (SFS ’19) said she was happy to see more individuals interact with the topic of race.
“Many people here have their social circles determined by what club they’re in … and friend groups are mostly of the same race, too. It’s bad, and naturally people gravitate to people who look like them,” Yuksel said. “But it’s good that it’s now being noticed, good that people are paying attention to it.”
Winslow Radcliffe-Trenner (SFS ’19) applauded the event’s focus but wished the event itself allowed for more intimate discussion.
“In its objective of making people woke, it was effective because it opened my eyes and the eyes of others to specific issues of racism at Georgetown,” Radcliffe-Trenner said. “But in terms of progressing the conversation, I’m not sure how it went. A conversation has to be a conversation, and there was not really an opportunity to speak back to someone in particular.”
Toward the event’s conclusion, Gallardo emphasized the importance of not being afraid to speak one’s beliefs and engage in issues that may appear difficult at first. She asserted that action needed to be coupled with purpose for effective change to take place.
“Make your beliefs heard. There’s a Japanese proverb: ‘Vision without action is a dream, and action without vision is a nightmare,’” Gallardo said.

“Davis explained that discussions on issues of race and discrimination do not happen as often as they should because people can see such dialogues as difficult.”
It’s not that people see these conversations as difficult, it’s that people don’t see them as dialogues, as opposed to a one-sided “talking to” in which we’re told that everything is white people’s fault, that white people are stupid and bad people who are thieves (just look at Renleigh’s cultural appropriation piece today), and that we should support more affirmative action, more special programs for minorities which are denied to poor white people (even though rich minorities can benefit), more liberal policies, and that we should feel ashamed and responsible for things we haven’t done, that we should shut up unless we’re going to defend the previously stated things, and that we should not complain or speak out when people make fun of us or discriminate against us because of our race.  ‘
There’s a reason why events like the one in this article tend to only have minority groups or white liberals who already agree with the presenters.  It’s because we know better and our time is better spent studying and accomplishing things and having fun with our friends than going to some event where were expected to feel guilty for something we didn’t do and are called racist if we don’t agree with the speakers.  Let’s face it, the biggest dividers on campus are the activist minorities who constantly complain they are oppressed and who demonize white people and instead of trying to make the world a better place for all are constantly demanding special treatment for their tribe.  They’re the ones who make dismissive and derogatory comments toward white people.  We know who they are and what clubs they are in, and when these individuals and and their clubs put on events, we ignore them.  If they were honest and less condescending and students thought they were sincere, and these “dialogues” were actually dialogues, then we might participate more.

Edmond D. Villani Chair of Economics Martin Ravallion launched his new book “The Economics of Poverty: History, Measurement, and Policy” during an official book launch in Riggs Library on Feb. 5.
The new book shares content and approaches explored in Ravallion’s undergraduate course at Georgetown titled “ECON-156: Poverty,” with a focus on the way future policies and policy makers could address an issue as complex as poverty.
Dean of the College Chester Gillis and professor of economics Francis Vella both introduced Ravallion, highlighting his contributions to the Jesuit tradition, his academic accomplishments and his overall impact on the Georgetown community.
“As [Gillis] said, you’ve really made a huge difference in the department and it gives me great personal pleasure to have the opportunity to celebrate the book,” Vella said. Following the remarks of his colleagues, Ravallion described how his interest in economics began, before outlining the structure of his book and the difficulties inherent in both writing and teaching others with limited backgrounds in economics.
Finally, he offered reflections on the future of global poverty before opening up the meeting to a question-and-answer session.
Ravallion said his work’s goal was to broaden the intersection of people interested in both economics and poverty in a way the average reader could understand without advanced mathematics and complicated theorems.
He compared his work with the example of an important paper he studied in graduate school by James Mirrlees on optimal taxation, which the professor then adapted for readers with less formal backgrounds in economic literature.
“I had to convert [that paper] into something I could teach to undergraduates in a book with no advanced mathematics using simple diagrams and words to explain the essence of Jim Mirrlees’ formulation of the equity-efficiency trade off,” Ravallion said.
Ravallion said his 700-page work contains no simple magic fixes for poverty. However, it does review evidence for many policies available, as well as the most relevant policy debates, providing a framework for thinking about the many problems policymakers face today, and for evaluating what works and what does not in specific contexts.
“The concept of poverty must be relevant to the society we’re talking about. There’s no point using India’s poverty line in this country or the U.S. poverty line in India. The U.S. poverty line is ten times the Indian poverty line,” Ravallion said.
Ravallion outlined both pessimistic and optimistic scenarios for the future of global poverty. The former path assumes a return to the slower reduction of poverty, characteristic of the late 20th century, and the second depended on the continuation of the faster trajectory present in the early 21st centuries. The optimistic scenario requires that we maintain the growth rates of the developing world since 2000 and see no increase in overall inequality.
“The pessimistic scenario will take 50 or more years to lift one billion people out of extreme poverty, while the optimistic path will do it in 15 years or so,” Ravallion said.
Ravallion also highlighted the numerous challenges that must be overcome to fight poverty. He noted the causes of poverty often begin early in a child’s life and stressed that formal schooling — while important — cannot entirely solve the greater issue of global destitution.
“Early childhood development — this has got to be pretty much number one on the agenda across the world today,” Ravallion said. “Much of the inequality and poverty in the world today comes from the first few years of life and it’s not easily redressed by schooling.”
Revallion said strategies to address poverty must include devising effective social protection policies to help tackle inequality and risk, managing urbanization and find reliable measurements for poverty.
He also argued the global situation of poverty is improving, adding that he is optimistic when it comes to the important role students and their experiences hold.
“I think very well of the Georgetown undergraduates. I’m not Jesuit, I’m not even Catholic, but I really appreciate that moral tradition,” Ravallion said. “When I started teaching that course, at first I thought, ‘Ah I’m going to teach those Georgetown students what poverty’s like in the world.’ And the first thing I found out is that many of them already know. That was a revelation.”
Economics professor Arik Levinson said he admired Ravallion’s dedication to the university.
“He is a fantastic colleague in both dimensions; you’ve seen it in interactions with undergraduates — he’s been a great mentor to our PhD students — and he’s a great colleague in seminars,” Levinson said.
Jiadi Chen (GRD ’19), who attended the event, praised Ravallion’s lectures for their comprehensibility through his particularly effective use of models and data as well as his insight on the issues of poverty as invaluable and encompassing.
“He gave a really general overview of the poverty and inequality issue global-wide, how this idea has evolved throughout history and what’s changing now,” Chen said.
Gene Choi (SFS ’16) said Ravallion’s teaching style allowed him to easily explain topics in a form that a wide variety of students could understand.
“There was a lot of material covered in the limited amount of lectures that we had, but Ravallion managed to make it simple and interesting. He is a well-known expert on the topic with lots of field experience, so his personal anecdotes were extremely helpful for understanding some difficult concepts,” Choi said.

Georgetown University’s recently launched India Initiative aims to promote dialogue and collaboration between Georgetown University and Indian universities, businesses and political organizations.
Established in December by the School of Foreign Service, the India Initiative has since hosted several high-profile events, including the visit of former Pakistani Ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani on Jan. 27.
Spearheading the program is associate professor Irfan Nooruddin, the initiative’s first director, Vice President of Global Engagement Tom Banchoff and SFS Dean Joel Hellman.
The initiative aims to engage the subcontinent at an academic level while creating opportunities for students and faculty to conduct research.
Hellman traveled to India to formally launch the initiative last December, meeting former Indian Minister of State and U.N. Under-Secretary-General Shashi Tharoor and Indian members of parliament, senior government officials and businessmen.
Faculty members have sought to engage India in the Georgetown academic community in the years prior to the initiative’s launch. Their endeavors consisted of attempts to encourage both student and faculty research of India while also working to connect internship and exchange programs with the Georgetown community as a whole.
Nooruddin emphasized the importance of research in the initiative and outlined a plan for how students and faculty would conduct research together.
“What we’re working on right now is to figure out models that connect faculty and students in ongoing, long-term research projects, such that students could plug in during a given semester and do something that’s already active,” Nooruddin said. “Faculty could dictate a research agenda that would be broadly consistent with the goals of the initiative, and find ways for students to engage in that process.”
In the future, leaders of the initiative will seek the development and expansion of curriculum concerning Indian culture, history, language and politics. Georgetown only has five classes about India, two of which focus on the South Asian region as a whole. Georgetown does not currently offer Hindi, although attempts have been made in past years to offer the class.
Nooruddin projected that the initiative will immediately address the relative lack of South Asian languages at Georgetown compared to other regions.
“My most optimistic view is that by fall 2016 we could have something on the books to teach Hindi at Georgetown,” Nooruddin said. “We don’t want one [Hindi] course, we want it to be possible for a student to start learning Hindi at Georgetown, and leave Georgetown being proficient.”
Many of Georgetown’s peer universities already have initiatives and programs focused on India, including Yale University, Harvard University and the University of California at Berkeley. In the spring of 2014, the University of Chicago opened a large academic and research center in Delhi.
Nooruddin believes the university holds an advantage over other schools, highlighting its location in Washington, D.C., and its proximity to numerous think tanks and research centers.
“None of those programs are in D.C. We see that as a really major comparative advantage for us. We want to use our D.C. location to facilitate a set of conversations that bring in policy makers, public intellectuals and thinkers into contact with their U.S. counterparts,” Nooruddin said. “And then use the think tank and government and the international multilateral organizations to facilitate those conversations.”
The student-led Georgetown-India Dialogue helped lay the groundwork for the initiative. Undergraduates Jeh Tirodkar (SFS ’16) and Yash Johri (SFS ’17) founded the dialogue in August 2014, with Nooruddin serving as the organization’s faculty advisor. Tirodkar expressed that the dialogue began with a commitment to bringing Georgetown and India closer together.
“The reason we started is being from SFS and coming from India and being politically inclined, when we look at the SFS with a presence all across the world and engaging all across the world, we found that lacking in India,” Tirodkar said. “It’s wrong for Georgetown to not have a presence in India and not engage India better.”
The dialogue brought several Indian speakers to campus last year, including government officials and businessmen. In April 2015, the group hosted an all-day conference with former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah as a keynote speaker on political and security developments in the Kashmir region and its effects for India.
Even with the development of the new India Initiative, Tirodkar asserted that the Georgetown-India Dialogue will continue its activity, citing the need for more student involvement in Indian affairs.
“While the university has launched the official India Initiative to engage professors, we think for us in the Georgetown-India Dialogue it’s important to make sure the community stays engaged with the political and social issues concerning India,” Tirodkar said.
Nooruddin said the ultimate success of the initiative will depend on fundraising and expressed his hopes for the future of the program in study abroad and curriculum opportunities.
“Much of the success will be our success in fundraising, so we have an independent, large enough endowment to support student enrollment in India,” Nooruddin said. “I’d like to see a much more robust exchange of people, both from Indian institutions coming to Georgetown and people going to India.”
Gaurav Premnath (COL ’19), who is a member of the Georgetown-India Dialogue, believes the initiative has great potential to attract people from diverse backgrounds across campus due to the events and opportunities it will generate.
“I think the initiative has great scope and can engage a lot of students who aren’t only from India, because the initiative creates a lot of dialogues and events that pertain to international affairs,” Premnath said. “It will increase awareness of the dynamics between India and other South Asian countries as well.”

The Beeck Center for Social Impact & Innovation announced this year’s recipients of its GU Impacts fellowship, a program that allows 16 undergraduate students to participate in a fully-funded 10-week summer internship focused on social innovation at organizations in the United States and abroad.
Fellows will intern with six social impact organizations: Fundación Avina in Colombia, Yanbal International in Peru, the Inventtus Corporation in Nicaragua, the Center for Civic Innovation in Atlanta, the D.C. Federal City Council and Mann Deshi Foundation in India.
The program accepted 16 fellows from a pool of 73 applicants this year, down from a pool of 115 applicants last year, the first year of the program. Applicants were able to rank specific programs based on language ability and preference.
Program Manager Matthew Fortier said the decline in applications is likely due to self-selection on the part of interested students.
“We were more transparent and clear at the beginning of the recruitment process about the requirements of the program,” Fortier said. “I think in that way, while we received fewer applications than last year for the same number of spots, essentially we had a higher quality of applications because applicants already knew what they were getting into when they applied.”
Fortier said the Impacts fellowship aims to expose students to the social development sector through experiential learning opportunities.
“More broadly speaking, we’re looking to develop individual leaders in all sectors,” Fortier said. “So we’re investing in the development of these individuals while. at the same time, they’re having a direct impact with the organizations and projects that we’re working with.”
Fortier said GU Impacts hopes to combine service and learning into a meaningful experience that fellows can draw on through the rest of their time at Georgetown.
“In doing that, we’re looking to have an impact on multiple levels, to have an impact on the individual fellows themselves, to influence their individual academic and professional careers and the contributions that they can make back to Georgetown and the larger community once they’ve returned,” Fortier said. “We’re also looking to have an impact on the organizations and the beneficiaries of these organizations themselves.”
Fellows at Fundación Avina, a new partnership for this year, will monitor the peace and political process in Colombia following the recent agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces, create an impact-investment platform for the foundation and examine the water imprint of Avina’s partner organizations.
According to Fortier, the partnership is pending approval from the Office of Global Services as Colombia is under a State Department travel warning.
“At Georgetown we already have graduate students doing work there with the Center for Latin American Studies, so we’re hopeful that we’ll be able to run that program this year,” Fortier said.
Yanbal International is a cosmetics company with a strong social impact mission. In a micro-entrepreneurship model similar to that of the cosmetics company Avon Products, Inc., Yanbal empowers its sales consultants to implement direct sales models under the supervision of a director.
GU Impacts fellows will work on analyzing and enhancing the company’s direct sales model and structure.
The Inventtus Corporation consists of two social enterprises, Nuve Technologies and Mochila Digital, which focus on democratizing technology in Latin America. The fellows will be working with these enterprises to examine how access to technology can contribute to education.
The Center for Civic Innovation in Atlanta is a startup that focuses on projects aimed at creating an environment that can catalyze entrepreneurship both in Atlanta and in cities across the United States.
The DC Federal City Council focuses on impact investing in infrastructure around the DC area, especially in Anacostia.
Mann Deshi Foundation is a multifaceted organization that works towards the economic empowerment of women in rural India. Mann Deshi consists of a bank, a business school and a chamber of commerce. The organization builds skills surrounding access to finance and helps the women with whom it works to develop their own businesses.
Shola Powell (COL ’17), a GU Impacts alumna mentor who interned with Mann Deshi last summer said she was able to see the impact of Mann Deshi first-hand.
“I went around to different villages and met with different women and learned more about their company and how Mann Deshi helped them, and what kind of resources they had access to,” Powell said.
Valerie Sanchez (SFS ’18), another alumna mentor who interned in the Philippines last summer with Ateneo Center for Educational Development, a partnership that has been discontinued this year, stressed the significance of the fellowship in helping her plan her path at Georgetown.
“It very much helped me in terms of being able to pick my major,” Sanchez said. “I decided that development is something that I wanted to focus on, and the strategy behind different projects or implementation of projects around the world, and that’s really what I came here for.”

Assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information Joyojeet Pal discussed the impact of social media and political rebranding on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s global image during an event in the Intercultural Center on Wednesday.
The event, titled “Narendra Modi, Twitter, and the Selfie State” focused on social media and the use of technology in politics, specifically regarding its use as an inspirational force in developing countries.
“What does it mean for a politician to be seen with a computer all the time? Or to be seen taking selfies?” Pal asked. “We are looking at the technology artifact and what that means, specifically in the larger Indian context.”
Pal said social media is an increasingly relevant factor in developing countries, as it grows more popular.
“We were able to come up with at least 38 countries in which both a leading head of government and at least one leading opposition figure has an excess of 100,000 followers,” Pal said.
Pal said even though countries like India, Ghana, Columbia, and Kenya may be relatively poor, if they have a large upper class with strong social media access, social media can be an effective political tool.
“The reason that social media is important in the case of Narendra Modi is that the political actor can choose to use the social media as their primary line of output,” Pal said.
According to Pal, country size, elite affiliation and media logic are important in a politician’s decision to use social media as a tool for discourse.
Pal said social media and technology can be used as a form of publicity that also ends up benefitting the populace.
“Ideas of technology as being intricately tied to development have been prevalent for the past two decades,” Pal said. “One of the best indicators of how closely technology is tied to aspiration in India is the fact that movie stars in movies are often playing computer engineers.”
Pal said Narendra Modi was originally depicted by the media in a negative light, particularly for his role during the Hindu-Muslim riots of 2002. Modi was criticized for failing to stop the riots in a timely manner as Governor of Gujarat, a northern Indian state.
“He was pretty close to what you might think of as a political pariah for many years following the 2002 riots, and this was also how he was seen in the mainstream English-speaking media,” Pal said.
According to Pal, Modi was able to change his reputation through a strategic social media presence that includes a LinkedIn profile, a Facebook, an Instagram, a Pinterest and a YouTube channel where he puts his official radio speeches as well as other videos on topics such as how to live well.
“His fashioning is not just as a political person, but as a guru who will tell you how to use yoga for stress management, for example,” Pal said. “His is an attempt to re-brand not only through strategic speech, but also through strategic imaging.”
Pal said Modi’s social media tactics are multifaceted as he makes his messages ubiquitous, associates himself with celebrities, crafts his messages in first person, and strategically uses “follow-backs” as political means.
“He provides a vision of somebody who is not only driven by technology, but also has command over technology coming through channels other than social media,” Pal said.
Pal’s research shows that Modi’s sarcastic and ironic tweets are re-tweeted the most, a phenomenon shared by 2016 Presidential candidate Donald Trump.
According to the research, Modi also tweets about international relations in the language of the countries he visits.
“He shows a real sensitivity to what the key topics are in that country in the ‘twitter-sphere’ when he goes there,” Pal said.
Pal said Modi has successfully built a social media profile that appeals to a variety of different constituencies, including both those attracted by conventional values and those wowed by fame.
“He is still someone who gets blessings from his aged mother as well as is comfortable posing next to a film star,” Pal said.
Emily Paragamian (SFS ’16), who attended the event, said she appreciated the comparison the talk presented between the poor in developing countries and the use of social media to appeal to the masses.
“I am really interested in the juxtaposition of the ‘selfie-state’ with the 600 million Indians that are off the grid, and I think that social media is a really useful tool but it can also probably be a detriment if there are so many people that can’t see what is going on,” Paragamian said.
Mark Giordano, the director of the science, technology and international affairs program and organizer of the event, said social media is playing an increasingly more important role in politics.
“Technology is such a key part of politics now that understanding how it is used around the world is important for us in the U.S. but also how we understand how the rest of the world is working,” Giordano said.

The School of Foreign Service announced former World Bank Chief Institutional Economist Joel Hellman as its new dean in April 2015. As Hellman, who officially took over the role in July, reaches the end of his first year on campus, The Hoya sat down with the dean to look back on his achievements and challenges of the past year, discuss the future of the school, which will celebrate its centennial anniversary in 2019, talk technology on a day the Internet failed, and explore the dean’s eclectic musical taste.
This interview has been edited for length and condensed for print.
What are your reflections on the past year?
It’s always great to join a school at the top of its game, but it’s a little daunting to join a school at the top of its game because the question is, where do you go from here?
But what’s really been unique about coming to a school at a period of such strength is, because the school is heading to its centennial anniversary in 2019 and 2020, there’s a real openness on the part of the faculty and alumni and students to think about what we’ve achieved in the past and what we need to do to address real challenges in the future.
What are the broad goals that the School of Foreign Service’s centennial vision is trying to achieve?
One of the things that has marked the school from its inception is that it takes an interdisciplinary approach to educating people about the challenges they will face. It takes a liberal arts approach because it tries to educate the whole person by giving them deep skills to think critically, read critically and present. It focuses on the relationship between policy, practice and big ideas.
Those trends and those aspects of the education are still as relevant today as they were 100 years ago when they were created. But I think there’s a lot we can do to build and strengthen those key fundamental aspects of who we are.
On the curriculum side, first, it’s allowing for greater flexibility. We can’t anticipate over the next years what the combination of skill sets will be. We know there are some core things like history, economics and politics, but increasingly students are coming to us and saying they’re interested in public health, human rights, journalism, media and communications, business. They want to combine the skills they get in business with SFS, in the [School of Nursing and Health Studies] with SFS, create different combinations of security studies and development. We need to create a much more flexible program that allows students to craft their program in a way that suits their goals and what they think they’re going to be doing in the world. Bottom line is, even though we’re the School of Foreign Service and everyone thinks we train diplomats, less than 2 percent of our students become diplomats. Most go on to do remarkable things with their SFS education, and we want to give them a little more flexibility — not throw away the core but create more opportunities to do that.
Second, science, quantitative skills. These are things that aren’t an add-on any more in education; they’re core to all global issues. We want to think about how do we bring those aspects into the educational program?
Third, a lot of our students study abroad. We want to see if we can integrate that as an integral part of every student’s program — not only semester abroad, but summers, vacations. Being in SFS encompasses some form of global engagement so that you’re actually trying to do something in a different environment. We’re seeing how we can support more and more of our efforts by students to do that.
The last thing is, the thing that has always distinguished our school being in D.C. is the link between practice and theory. I think we can do more to give undergraduates access to policymakers and practitioners. Not only big talks in Gaston Hall, which are great, but also informal talks to make them understand how they’ve built their careers, how they’ve made decisions, what attitudes and approaches they take.
Related to the greater flexibility, this week, the SFS announced the language minors program. Are there steps to build off that and perhaps include other minors as well?
There’s a lot of interest from students in minors and to build up expertise in different disciplines, different skill sets that are not in the traditional SFS framework. We’re looking for ways to make that happen. If minors are the best way of doing that, I think that’s something we should think about.
Minors are not the only way. The thing that drives people in minors is they want credentials, they want a stamp that says, “Hey, I did that.” We want to enable students to do that.
I would also say that, if the curriculum becomes more flexible, and there’s a little bit more room built into the program for student choice, then that would also enable us to think more seriously about minors.
When we talked last year, one of your immediate goals was to reach out to various parts of the school and plan the future in a collaborative process. In that process, what surprised you about things that parts of the community told you were a problem? What points did they emphasize?
I think that it is more difficult than I anticipated for students to work across schools. Students have a lot of concerns about that. I know the provost and the deans are all interested in creating more opportunities for students to reach across different parts of the school.
I hear a lot, within SFS, of students not being able to take advantage of all of the resources within SFS. We have over 20 programs and centers: Those are great things because they give students the chance to work with smaller groups of people who are deeply interested in what they’re doing, but often they’re interested in thinking about linkages.
You talked about teaching; I remember that was one of the first things you wanted to do last year. How has the process of getting into teaching a full course been?
I didn’t know that this year was going to be a bit crazy. I did an enormous amount of travel this year: It’s really important to me to reconnect the school with our alumni. We haven’t been strong enough in reaching out to our SFS alumni, so I’ve been pounding the pavement going to big markets where we have SFS alumni to introduce myself to them, hear from them and then reconnect them to the school so they have a stake in the school. That’s taken a lot of time from the classroom.
What I have done is a series of lectures in lots of different classes, talking about my area of expertise — which is fragility and conflict and the relationship between conflict and development — in different parts of the school, which has been great for me because I’ve been interacting at the graduate level, undergraduate level, in big government department classes as well as small Russian studies seminars. And finally, I was faculty teaching on a one-credit course on the history of the SFS with [government professor] Anthony Arend and [Dean’s Office Chief of Staff] Emily Zenick.
Next year, I’m planning with [SFS assistant professor] Ken Opalo, one of our young faculty here: We’re teaching a course on conflict and development, and that’s going to be a formal, proper course. But I must say that I’m really glad this year that I took this approach: I must have given a dozen lectures on campus in different courses, as well as the history course, so it just gave me a great introduction.
I wanted to talk a little bit about technology.
On the day that our Internet is down?
Nicely ironic! International affairs — just like every subject — face the opportunities and challenges that technology provides, and in all my courses, we talk about technology as well, but, at the same time, our curriculum does not necessarily focus that much on technology or science. Including the curriculum, but also including research and educational style, how does the SFS integrate itself more with advances in the 21st century?
It’s such a critical question. It really is very high on our priority list as we think about the centennial and the vision. I’m really pleased to see that science, technology and international affairs is one of the fastest-growing majors in the school; it’s clear that students are voting with their feet. Investing in that will be an important priority going forward. We’ve got such incredible faculty there that are showing what you can do with students: [professors] Joanna Lewis on energy policy, Mark Giordano on water. Sarah Johnson is studying life on other planets; who would have thought 100 years ago that there would be an SFS professor who thinks about life on Mars?
We also have alums who are really engaged and we’re really trying to engage them. One of our new board members, for example, is the general counsel of SpaceX, Tim Hughes (SFS ’94).
We are — on the part of the curriculum reform — seriously moving towards integrating a science requirement of some sort, as part of an overall university effort to ensure that science becomes a part of everyone’s program. We’re talking through what that might mean for SFS.
We’re also talking about how to ensure quantitative literacy at SFS.
We have four economics courses: The question is, is that the right combination of skills that gives students enough of an understanding of quantitative literacy so that they can function well in different environments, whether that’s the private sector or public sector?
In terms of the SFS becoming more global — I know that is another big push — you travelled to India to unveil the GU India Initiative. What was the impetus behind that initiative, and what kind of similar things are you trying to implement elsewhere to create those connections with other countries?
Having a diverse international student body is absolutely critical to SFS’ own identity. This is not a luxury. As a school of international affairs, if we don’t have a diverse representation of views in the classroom, when we’re discussing the toughest issues, then we can’t really make the claim to be a top-ranked global school. I think we can do better on that score at SFS.
I don’t think we’re keeping pace with the best schools in the world — not just the U.S. — in terms of attracting that globally diverse and socio-economically diverse student body: globally, bringing more international students in, and a socioeconomically diverse group of students. Because of financial aid and federal funding, we have a differential: We have 62 percent of domestic SFS students who are on financial aid, but we have a very small percentage of international students on financial aid. We’ve got to address that imbalance. One of my highest priorities is to build the financial strength of SFS in order for us to do so.
Second is the relationships. That’s where you get to the GU India Initiative. That’s why I traveled to India, Hong Kong, Europe. I’m going to go to Africa next year. I’ve lived in eight different countries over the last 20 years. I have a college-age daughter; we’ve mentored a lot of college-age kids coming to the U.S. It is a bewildering system for someone coming from outside the United States. There are thousands of colleges to go to. How do you start to think about that? We need to start building relationships so that we get the word out, not just about Georgetown, but also about SFS. What is SFS? What does that mean?
When the early admits were given, we called all of the international students. I talked to one father in Singapore, and he said, “I’m glad you called. I have a question for you. Why should I send my son off to study foreign service so that he can join the U.S. Foreign Service?” People need to understand better about what we do.
One of my friends told me that you are very much into jazz. What is your favorite jazz record or musician?
You know, I have very eclectic tastes, and so on my own, when nobody else is around, I listen to what my wife would describe as “unlistenable music,” and that ranges from the avant-garde era from the mid- to late 1960s to contemporary challenging classical jazz. There’s something called the Bang on a Can music collective in New York that is really interesting — sometimes unlistenable, but I like to call it challenging.
When other people are in the room, I love classic jazz, from Louie Armstrong up through Bennie Goodman and Duke Ellington and the great jazz orchestras, and I’m a great fan of the bebop era. How about yourself?
I love hip-hop.
Oh, I just went to see “Hamilton.” That, I think, was one of the most remarkable things that I’ve done in a very long time because this notion of taking the story of the American Revolution and the Founding Fathers and reclaiming it with hip-hop and rap and recasting the whole story — it was in some ways the most natural thing you can imagine. It really reflected the very spirit of the Revolution and the Founding Fathers, and I thought that was great.

A group of 13 Georgetown University students joined 1,000 others to attend the ninth annual Clinton Global Initiative University at the University of California, Berkeley from April 1 to 3.
Established by former President Bill Clinton, CGI U was created in 2007 to bring leaders together from across the world to explore current challenges in modern society.
The Georgetown students who applied were accepted to attend the meeting by proposing a plan called “Commitment to Action.” The proposal addresses a pressing global issue in one of CGI U’s five focus areas: education, poverty alleviation, public health, environment and climate change and peace and human rights.
Each commitment, which can either be presented individually or in groups of up to three, must set forth a new idea and have specific quantitative or qualitative goals.
At the conference, students participated in skill-building, networking and working group sessions. A total of $900,000 in funding was available this year to support students’ commitments.
Since the conference held its inaugural meeting in 2008, students have implemented over 3,400 commitments that have impacted 430 million people in over 180 countries.
Georgetown Vice President for Government Relations and Community Engagement Christopher Murphy (GRD ’98), who also serves as CGI U’s campus liaison, praised the conference as an important opportunity for Georgetown students.
“It’s a really exciting opportunity for Georgetown students to be able to share some of their innovative ideas for changing the world, and I think it was also an opportunity for them to receive the kind of support and recognition that we want them to have,” Murphy said. “It really illustrates the variety of students and what they’re clearly united in — a desire to change the world and a commitment to finding a practical way to do just that. That’s what we really wanted to honor.”
Febin Bellamy (MSB ’17) was first invited to the conference in 2014 while attending Rockland Community College in New York. His commitment, named “Just Save One: Project India,” raised over $5,000 worth of medical supplies to send to three hospitals in Goa.
This year, Bellamy, who served as Georgetown’s student representative at the conference, proposed a commitment titled “Unsung Heroes,” a Humans of New York-style social media platform dedicated to highlighting the facilities workers of Georgetown University and sharing their stories.
Bellamy said his commitment’s purpose is to highlight the work of employees that often goes unnoticed on campus.
“‘Unsung Heroes’ is trying to show appreciation for the workers who do so much for our campus behind the scenes, but often times they don’t get recognized or appreciated for it,” Bellamy said. “Once we get students to learn about their stories, we’re going to try do custodian appreciation days, particularly to show awareness.”
Bellamy was raised in rural India until he was five years old. He said he plans to return to the country after graduation and use his undergraduate business background to complete consulting and service work.
“My long-term goal is to start a nonprofit that helps some of the poverty alleviation in India, where I’m from originally,” Bellamy said. “As far as directly after graduation, I want to develop the skills of becoming a successful nonprofit leader.”
Another “Commitment to Action” was called “Students Applying Technology and Coding for Human Rights” by Alex Luta (COL ’16), Amin Gharad (COL ’16) and Joseph Lanzilla (SFS ’16), which proposes using geospatial technology to advance human rights.
The commitment by Alexander Wheeler (COL ’17), Jennifer Ding (COL ’17) and Martin Vanin (SFS ’17) attempts to use microfinance to reintegrate demobilized members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a guerilla movement involved in the country’s ongoing armed conflict.
Rocio Mondragon Reyes (SFS ’19) began “Students Equipped for Tomorrow” with Diego Tum-Monge (COL ‘19), an education proposal looking to motivate minority students to pursue post-secondary interests. They are currently partnered with a local high school in the District’s Ward 4.
Reyes said his status as a first-generation American has guided his commitment to social justice and plans for the future.
“We’re both first-generation minority students, so we’re looking to test our own theories how to help students like ourselves,” Reyes said. “I feel like social justice work is something that I won’t do as a career because it’s more a part of my life. Regardless of what my career title is, I will continue doing it and make sure that I’m doing it throughout my life.”
Hannah Gerdes (SFS ’16) spent the summer between her junior and senior year of college in Vidarbha, India, working with a research unit on mental health. Her commitment is named “Qualitative Research on Individual-Level Protective Factors,” which works to train and utilize the way health workers provide psychosocial intervention.
Gerdes reflected on the connections she made during the conference and the impact they had on her perspective of her proposal.
“The most important thing that I took away were from casual interactions, not from a particular program or panel, but from waiting in line for lunch or dinner, or waiting in line to catch a shuttle, striking up conversation with other students who were there and getting ideas and feedback about our commitments,” Gerdes said.
Three other students, Sarah AbdulRazak (COL ’18), Sebastian Nicholls (SFS ’16) and Katherine Schmidt (SFS ’18), also attended the conference.
Bellamy lauded CGI U’s encouragement of student leadership and innovation.
“I like [CGI U] because it inspires students to not be followers but be leaders, actually start your own project, actually go out of your comfort zone and do something totally innovative,” Bellamy said. “That’s what I like most about CGI U. It takes us out of our comfort zone. You have to be innovative every single time you go there. You have to do something different.”

The Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service launched the Baker Center for Leadership and Governance, a nonpartisan initiative focused on discourse and original research, with a town hall Tuesday, which convened leaders in politics, media, business and religion in a discussion on restoring faith in American establishment.
The Baker Center is named for its benefactors Jon M. Baker Sr. (CAS ’64) and Patricia Baker. Jon Baker, who formerly served on Georgetown’s board of regents, received the university’s highest honor, the John Carroll Award, in 1991.
According to the Baker Center website, the center aims to spur dialogue among civil society and key institutions in the public, private and academic sectors to resolve global challenges through mutual trust and policy solutions.
The center, a facet of Georgetown’s McCourt School of Public Policy, plans to host an annual Baker Forum — a gathering of government, business, nonprofit and academic leaders.
Additionally, the Baker Center intends to support and publish independent research by both members of the Georgetown community and the greater public at large as well as hold regular policy roundtables to discuss the research, according to its website.
Held at the Fisher Colloquium, the launch consisted of a panel moderated by National Public Radio host Steve Inskeep. Panelists included Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake (D), entrepreneur Sonal Shah, media expert Michelle Jaconi (SFS ’96, GRD ’97) and John Carr, the director of Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life.
The conversation focused on the importance of trust in institutions, while spanning topics including tensions between police and minority communities, disappointment in the lack of fulfillment of President Barack Obama’s campaign promises and the reforms instituted by the Catholic Church following the child sex abuse scandal.
McCourt School of Public Policy Dean Edward Montgomery prefaced the town hall by emphasizing its commitment to generating conversations among different stakeholders.
“This in a nutshell is the mission of the Baker Center, one which is both global in scale and simple in its construct — to tackle some of society’s most intractable challenges, and doing so in a way that brings everyone to the table in a constructive civil discourse that helps restore some of the faith that has been lost in our core institutions,” Montgomery said.
Institute of Politics and Public Service Executive Director Mo Elleithee
(SFS ’94), who introduced the panelists, said the country is at a crossroads, now more than ever, as the public grapples with its own distrust of key institutions.
“There’s this palpable national moment we’re all in, and we see it playing out in our TV screens and our neighborhoods. No one trusts anyone,” Elleithee said.
Rawlings-Blake, who ascended to Baltimore’s mayoral office in 2010 when her predecessor Sheila Dixon resigned after being convicted of felony theft, addressed the reforms she implemented to combat the local government’s tarnished reputation.
However, she contended the specter of distrust continues to loom large over her administration, especially following the violence that ensued in response to after the death of Freddie Gray under the custody of the Baltimore Police Department in 2015 during her term as mayor.
“I can say that there has been a significant disconnect between the police force and the community for a significant number of reasons,” Rawlings-Blake said. “I think it’s easy to see it as somebody else’s problem. I think what happened with Freddie Gray made it clear to many people that what happened wasn’t just my problem, it wasn’t just the government’s problem, it was a real problem we had to address.”
As the director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life, Carr discussed the reputation of the Catholic Church and how it is still recuperating from allegations of child sexual abuse from priests, new measures to provide background checks and training procedures for the clergy have contributed to alleviating public distrust from the scandal. Still, Carr said the ascension of Pope Francis has had the largest impact on the level of public trust in the Catholic Church.
“We’ve become the poster child for betrayed trust to an eventual renewed trust, because at least at the global level we have a new leader with very different priorities who is focused on the poor and the vulnerable and not the institutions,” Carr said. “He leads by his words, by his example and by his faith.”
Jaconi, the vice president and executive editor of the Independent Journal Review, highlighted the paradoxical nature of the public’s surging distrust of the media coinciding with increased social media consumption.
“What I’m still hopeful in is that social media has an ability to show the human side of everything,” Jaconi said. “Any time you can do something to remind people who are reading or consuming your media that you are human, too, is really important.”
Inskeep explained his belief that the tension between objectivity and humanity contributes to the public’s frustrations with the media.
“So many people talk about objectivity in journalism and I don’t believe many people believe in the concept anymore,” Inskeep said. “There used to be the idea of being the voice from nowhere, just giving facts, but I have a voice, I use it, I’m not from nowhere, I’m a guy from Indiana, I’m an American, and I have certain backgrounds, and I still want to tell the truth, and I’m finding a way to tell the truth but acknowledge the fact that we’re human beings.”
The panelists reached a consensus that demographic patterns, including the growth of the minority community in the coming century and the advent of the millennial generation, will shape the public’s faith in their institutions.
Shah, who now serves as the executive director of the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation, stressed the potential of millennials in reversing attitudes toward the American establishment.
“I don’t know if millennials are any better, but I think they have an opportunity to rewrite the world,” Shah said.
In the event’s closing remarks, Baker urged students to engage with the problem of mounting public distrust rather than depend on institutions to resolve the issue.
“The essence is that it’s important that we do something, so in that context, it’s the students, it’s the young people in the room, it’s you who have to get in the game, you have to want it, you have to commit to a difference,” Baker said. “To me, institutions are not the solution. There’s been a breakdown of institutions.”
Omar Torres (COL ’18) said he gained a renewed faith in institutions after hearing about the mission of the Baker Center.
“In the election, you hear from both sides that government is not trustworthy, that we need to make America great again or something like that,” Torres said. “But at the same time there are institutions that have the purpose of working for the people and if there’s something that I’m taking out of the discussion it’s that there’s hope in how they work and that there’s ways in which to make it more trustworthy for the people.”

This year’s TEDxGeorgetown speakers include six students and three external speakers, including Vice President of CNN U.S. and CNN Worldwide General Manager Andrew Morse.
In its sixth iteration, the event, which takes place Oct. 22, will focus on a theme of “The Tipping Point,” highlighting different moments in speakers’ lives that have led to change.
The TED organization runs various conferences and speeches around the world on a broad range of academic and cultural topics. While TEDxGeorgetown uses the original TED Talks format, Georgetown students organize every aspect of the conference. Chosen last spring by the TEDxGeorgetown board, the theme was inspired by Malcolm Gladwell’s book “The Tipping Point”, according to TEDxGeorgetown Co-Chair Natalia Peña (COL ’17)
“It is defined as the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point,” Peña wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The six student speakers, Agnes Lee (SFS ’17), Amina Gerrbi (MSB ’17), Anthony Anderson (COL ’18), Jeong Whan Park (SFS ’17), Febin Bellamy (MSB ’17) and Summer Durant (COL ’18), were selected by members of the TEDxGeorgetown board.
The conference will also feature Jonah Reider, a student at Columbia University who converted his dorm room into a restaurant, and Mary Beth Bruggemen, executive director of the Southeast Region for The Mission Continues, a nonprofit that helps connect veterans with service opportunities in the states.
Peña said the organization attempts to select as diverse a group of speakers as possible.
“We try to get a dynamic group of speakers that put across our theme in the best way possible,” Peña wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We try to look for people who don’t only have great inspiring stories, but who also have the capacity to engage the audience as much as possible whether that be through inspiring people with their stories or simply captivating them with their enthusiasm and personality.”
Each student speaker comes to the event with a unique background and moment to discuss. Speakers were chosen not only because of their individual stories but also based on how they would work in combination with their peer speakers, according to TEDxGeorgetown Co-Chair D.J. Angelini (MSB ’17).
“Our goal was not to judge or evaluate someone’s experience; our goal was simply to pick the best combination of student speakers to hit on the various aspects of our theme,” Angelini wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Gerrbi and the other student speakers were selected for their unique moments that relate to the theme of “The Tipping Point.”
Gerrbi said she will be speaking about the impact of the Arab Spring on her journey to Georgetown.
“I don’t want to give too much away, but I will discuss my time living through the Arab Spring and how I miraculously ended up at Georgetown despite it being virtually impossible,” Gerrbbi wrote. “The goal is to help people understand that we are all capable of shaping our own realities if we want to.”
Anderson, who recently found out he is HIV-positive, will discuss how the disease disproportionately affects black gay males, while Lee will speak about her experience living in the country without authorization.
Durant will deliver a spoken-word poem about her experience reconciling being half Indian and half black; Park, a veteran, will speak about his struggles with mental health.
Bellamy will speak about his work founding Unsung Heroes, which seeks to give back to under-recognized workers at Georgetown.
Gerrbi said she wants to convince attendees to set goals beyond societal limits.
“I constantly see people making decisions based on their limiting beliefs and what society decides is ‘realistic’ or ‘unrealistic’ for them,” Gerrbi said. “I have a story that really challenges society’s norms, and I want people to get the chance to hear it so that they can walk away inspired and motivated to take on any challenge they face in the future.”
Morse, who produced CNN’s presidential debate, monitors CNN newsgathering operations as well as the Washington Bureau and D.C.-based programming, will be speaking about the unprecedented nature of the upcoming presidential election.

The audience of Gaston Hall heard the stories of a media executive developing coverage for this year’s general election, a student reflecting on a recent suicide attempt and another on his diagnosis as being HIV-positive at the sixth annual TEDxGeorgetown event in Gaston Hall on Saturday.
The speakers included Executive Vice President of Editorial, CNN U.S. and Digital Worldwide General Manager Andrew Morse, Jeong Whan Park (SFS ’17), Amina Gerbbi (MSB ’17), Anthony Anderson (COL’18) and Mary Beth Bruggeman, executive director of the southeast region for The Mission Continues, a nonprofit that helps connect veterans with service opportunities in America.
The theme of the conference, which is based on the TED format but is entirely organized by students, was inspired by Malcolm Gladwell’s “The Tipping Point.”
TEDx Co-Chair Natalia Peña (COL ’17) said a tipping point is defined as something that can seem momentous or minuscule and can be experienced by anyone.
“A tipping point can be a huge life event or just making the decision to get out of bed this morning. That’s the beauty of it,” Peña said.
The 10 talks were broken up into three different sessions spread throughout the day. Each block was followed by breakout sessions, in which audience members were able to ask questions and hear from the speakers in a more intimate setting.
Agnes Lee
As an undocumented student, Agnes Lee (SFS ’17), shared her experiences with student group  UndocuHoyas and how they helped her embrace her identity.
“It didn’t take long for me to realize that I had arrived at home,” Lee said. “We uplifted one another and empowered one another because we knew that we were stronger together.”
Lee said the tipping point in her acceptance of the profoundness and commonality of the undocumented experience came as she sat in mourning with a friend’s undocumented mother in Los Angeles.
“This was one of those moments when I wanted everything around me to stop. Just all the noise, I wanted it to be silent and I wanted to just hold one another, and just understand what that grip meant,” Lee said. “But that grip, its very essence means that we must keep going, that the fight must continue.”
Andrew Morse
Remaining competitive in the media industry requires constant evolution, according to Executive Vice President of Editorial, CNN U.S. and Digital Worldwide General Manager Andrew Morse.
Morse said CNN’s goal in the run up to this November’s election was to make CNN the best political coverage team — not only on TV, but across all platforms.
“We wanted to create the best political team. Period. We wanted to set ourselves up with an unprecedented team and an unprecedented focus, and let ourselves be the best again,” Morse said.
However, Morse said changes in the media landscape are not over.
“You’re never done. In an effort to be the best, in an effort to continue, you’re never done. Especially at a time like this, with a race like this. We’re experiencing a completely staggering paradigm shift in media right now, so you’re never done,” Morse said.
Summer Durant
Summer Durant (COL ’18) performed a spoken word piece about balancing the multifaceted nature of her mixed black and Indian backgrounds.
Durant said she struggles with balancing and embracing the various aspects of her identity, which often feel like direct opposites.
“I’ve never presented as black, so I felt a lot of pressure to act black, surely perpetuating stereotypes along the way,” Durant said. “But when my Indian family asked me why I neglected our culture, I told them that it did not feel genuine to me.”
Durant said her worries about cultural appropriation are embodied by Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who claimed to be black and served as the president of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Spokane, Wash., before she was forced to resign in 2015 over questions over her race.
“She was my worst fears realized. I was not about to let her undermine everything I had worked so hard just to balance,” Durant said. “I realize now that she marked a tipping point in my life. She provoked me to write slam poetry.”
Febin Bellamy
Unsung Heroes Founder Febin Bellamy (MSB ’17) said his tipping point came after his father suffered a massive stroke following his high school graduation, forcing him to refocus his priorities on others.
“I realized that it forced me to snap out of my high school mindset, to become the man for my family and to actually apply myself in school. To think about the future, not just for myself but for my mother and family,” Bellamy said.
Bellamy said his inspiration for Unsung Heroes, which seeks to spotlight workers on campus, came from late nights studying in the MSB and the lack of interaction he noticed between students and facilities workers.
“I remember seeing these workers late at night, and students would never thank or even acknowledge them,” Bellamy said. “These individuals inspired me to start Unsung Heroes, in an initiative to acknowledge and appreciate workers on college campuses.”
Bellamy invited two of the Unsung Heroes, Facilities Worker Oneil Batchelor and Facilities Worker Evans Arthur-Williams onstage with him, to acknowledge their impact on his time at Georgetown.
“These two have honestly changed my whole experience here at Georgetown,” Bellamy said.
Elizabeth Ferris
Elizabeth Ferris, a research professor in the School of Foreign Service and senior fellow in the foreign policy studies program at Brookings Institution, said tipping points do not occur frequently enough to solve global tragedy.
Ferris said the humanitarian crisis in Syria, where world leaders have frequently called for the need to find a resolution to the fighting, highlights this problem.
“When I think of Syrian refugees, I think of a lot of almost-tipping points, where I thought things were really going to change and they really didn’t,” Ferris said.
Ferris said it is important to remember the plight of refugees when working to address humanitarian crises.
“Over and over again in my work with refugees I have felt very humble. You see the struggle and the courage of desperate people who have made it somewhere,” Ferris said. “They are survivors. They are heroes.”
Jeong Whan Park
Jeong Whan Park (SFS ’17) shared with the audience the thoughts he had leading up to his suicide attempt last spring, highlighting the danger of depression on college campuses.
“There were no extenuating circumstances to answer the question why I would try to kill myself, but that is where the danger lies,” Park said. “It can happen to anyone, anytime, for any reason.”
Park said thinking of his parents and all those in his life that would be affected by his decision inspired him to keep going.
“My life, though it may sound as if it is mine, is not my own,” Park said. “It is a big puzzle, composed of little pieces belonging to everyone who has endeared me and who, reversely, find the strength to live on through the ups and downs of their lives, with the knowledge that there are people, like me, who support and care for them.”
Amina Gerbbi
Amina Gerbbi (MSB ’17), who lived in Benghazi, Libya, during the Arab spring of 2011, shared how her fleeing the country resulted in both her greatest failures and greatest successes.
Gerbbi said being in a war forces one to confront questions they would never have previously considered.
“We would talk about what we would do in case we were about to be raped. Would we kill ourselves in order to avoid being raped?” Gerbbi said. “During times of war, you see things you never thought you’d see.”
Upon her return to the United States, Gerbbi struggled in school, taking both junior and senior year classes during her third year of high school. She graduated with a low GPA, having not gained acceptance to a single university to which she applied.
Gerbbi said this failure ultimately set her on her path to Georgetown, as she worked diligently to overcome her past failures.
“My tipping point caused a revolution in myself which allowed me to create a reality that would not have come into existence had I listened to society,” Gerbbi said. “And I’m here now.”
Jonah Reider
Jonah Reider, a recent Columbia graduate who started a restaurant in his dorm room, said combining food with art helped create a more engaging social experience.
“This was a dining experience that prioritized accessibility and social interaction, just as much if not more than the food itself,” Reider said. “All this dorm room cooking taught me that the satisfaction that people derive from an experience had less to do with the fanciness or quality of the food that they were eating, but rather the extent to which they could participate and engage with that process of creating and consuming.”
Anthony Anderson
To Anthony Anderson (COL’18), the statistic that one in two gay and bisexual men will be diagnosed with HIV became a reality recently.
Anderson cited the fact that HIV disproportionately affects gay and bisexual men, compared to a rate of one in 48 women diagnosed annually with HIV.
“HIV is something that we can change as a community,” Anderson said. “The statistics have always been there, but I think fear really hinders people.”
Despite his fear of speaking out, Anderson said he understood the importance of sharing his story with others.
“I know this is a story that goes beyond me. This is a narrative that need to be told, not only in our community but outside our community,” Anderson said. “These numbers are already here, and they’ll continue to get higher if we do nothing about it.”
Mary Beth Bruggeman
Mary Beth Bruggeman, executive director of the southeast region for The Mission Continues, a nonprofit that helps connect veterans with service opportunities in America, advocated the need for diversity in the workplace.
Bruggeman said that as a young platoon leader and the only female in her Marine Corps cohort, she struggled to find her place amongst her fellow marines.
“I realized that many of those marines didn’t see me as a leader. They couldn’t see past the fact that I was a woman,” Bruggeman said. “In the interest of self-preservation, I started to let many pieces of myself fall away. I made myself one-dimensional. I was a marine. Not a woman marine; a marine.”
Bruggeman said this served as a tipping point to the realization that she was not living her most authentic life.
“I invite you to take a hard look at yourself and decide, like I did, to embrace a new reality. Know the truth that every organization needs diversity and authenticity not just to survive, but to thrive,” Bruggeman said. “Be bold, know who you are and have the power to let yourself shine through.”

Six Georgetown alumni were newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and one to the U.S. Senate in Tuesday’s Congressional elections.
The six alumni entering the House of Representatives are Democrat Stephanie Murphy of Florida (GRD ’04), Republican Francis Rooney of Florida (CAS ’75, GRD ’78), Republican Trey Hollingsworth of Indiana (GRD ’14), Republican John Faso of New York (GRD ’79), Republican Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin (GRD ’12, GRD ’13) and Democrat Pramila Jayapal of Washington (CAS ’86).
Jayapal will become the first Indian-American woman to serve in the U.S. House after succeeding Democrat Jim McDermott as the representative for Washington’s 7th district.
Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland (GRD ’90) will join six incumbent alumni in the Senate, including Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont (GRD ’64) and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska (CAS ’80), who won re-election in their states Tuesday.
These alumni join a total of 22 members in the House and Senate in the 115th Congress who hold degrees from Georgetown, composed of 16 Democrats and six Republicans.
Republican Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois (GRD ’92) is the only incumbent alumnus who did not win his re-election bid. Kirk lost to his Democratic opponent, Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth from Illinois’ 8th district.
Associate Vice President for Federal Relations Scott Fleming expressed pride in the alumni serving in Congress.
“Of course we are tremendously proud of these members of the Georgetown community who are, through public service, living our mission of educating men and women for others,” Fleming said. “We look forward to connecting them to university life as they assume their new positions.”
Government professor James Lengle said he consistently donates his own money to help elect Georgetown graduates.
“I’ve always contributed money to former students of mine who ran for public office regardless of political party. It’s my way of supporting and encouraging their commitment to public service,” Lengle said. “I’m very proud when Georgetown graduates act on ideals instilled by their education and by the values and mission of the university.

Georgetown accepted 11.9 percent of its 7,822 early action applicants to the Class of 2021, 1 percent lower than last year’s 13 percent and the lowest acceptance rate in university history.
Georgetown notified the early action applicants about their acceptance or deferral to the regular admissions pool by mail Dec. 15. The applicant pool also increased by 11 percent from last year.
Of the early applicants, 4,415 applied to Georgetown College and 502 were admitted at an 11.3 percent acceptance rate. 1,618 applied to the School of Foreign Service and 204 were admitted at 12.6 percent acceptance rate. 1,263 applied to the McDonough School of Business and 157 were accepted at a 12.4 percent acceptance rate. Finally, 526 applied to the School of Nursing and Health Studies and 68 were accepted at a 12.9 percent acceptance rate.
This year’s application pool also marked an increase in students from minority groups from last year’s pool. The number of black student early action applicants rose 22 percent from 620 to 755. Applications from Latino students increased 25 percent from 792 to 989. Asian-American applicants rose 24 percent from 1025 to 1271. There was also an 8 percent increase of American Indian applicants.
Overall, Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69) noted a 6 percent increase in applications from students who were the first generation in their family to attend college.
Deacon said the increase in early action applicants could be attributed to the increased attention on Washington, D.C., and Georgetown’s reputation within the nation.
“Maybe because it’s an election year, people are looking to Washington,” Deacon said. “Increasingly people recognize that this is a power center. It’s not a financial power center, it’s not an entrepreneurial, Silicon Valley-type power center, but it’s a power center.”
Deacon said although the top 10 places students apply from remained the same, he saw a notable increase in applicants from southern states. The top 10 regions this year are California, New York, foreign countries, New Jersey, Maryland, Florida, Virginia, Massachusetts, Texas and Pennsylvania.
Of the top ten places applications came from, the largest increase was from Texas, which saw a 29 percent increase in applications. Virginia saw a 28 percent increase and Pennsylvania saw a 20 percent increase. The smallest growth came from international applications, which Deacon categorized as coming from students with a foreign address. The number of applications from foreign countries increased by 2 percent.
“Being strategically located in the nation’s capital, which is unique but also kind of at the gateway to the South, we are pretty well-positioned for these changes,” Deacon said. “We have the brand and reputation, we have the strategic location and we’re in the region of the South.”
Georgetown strategically keeps its early action acceptance rate lower than that of the regular acceptance rate, Deacon said. The overall acceptance rate for the Class of 2020 was around 16.4 percent.
Deacon highlighted that Georgetown refuses to use the Common Application, instead using their own application as well as encouraging students to take and submit the SAT II tests and requiring all test scores. Despite the distinctive process, Deacon said it was interesting that the number of applicants continues to grow.
“It’s what keeps our pool down a little bit, because we don’t have the frivolous applicants. They’re not going to waste their time doing our application,” Deacon said. “We do a lot of things that would be different than most colleges and get very good results. The fact that we’ve held these lines in this hyper-aggressive college marketing world and our pool continues to go up, even though it’s harder in some ways, Georgetown stands out a little bit as a place that’s different.”
He expects the regular decision pool for this year to fall between 21,000 to 22,000 applicants, an increase from last year’s pool of around 20,000. Deacon said the overall acceptance rate could also fall given the expected increase in applicants.
“As the pool goes up, if it keeps going up until the end, it means the admit rate will go down. We think that the regular admit rate could come down, and if the admit rate goes down, you’re increasingly admitting the best students, because you’re obviously admitting the best students of the pool and they then usually have more options. The yield rate could go down too. But, we’re not planning on that,” Deacon said.
For the Class of 2020, the yield rate remained consistent with previous years’ rate at around 48 percent. The Class of 2019 had a 47.6 percent yield rate.
The average admitted student was in the top 2 percent of their class with SAT scores ranging from 710 to 770 in critical reading and 700 to 770 in math. The average ACT score was between 32 and 35.
However, Deacon noted the competitiveness in the admissions process forces Georgetown to reject more students.
“We try to make things better all the time, but we don’t tend to make substantial changes. We do things essentially with the same principles guiding us,” Deacon said. “It’s not our goal to have 35,000 applications. We don’t love rejecting people.”
Early action applicants that were not accepted are deferred to the regular decision pool and will receive notification of final decisions April 1. All accepted students will have until May 1 to commit to the Class of 2021.
Deacon emphasized that Georgetown’s application process, which separates itself from the Common Application and schedules alumni interviews for applicants, is student-centered, which is a guiding principle in the way Deacon puts together the admissions process.
“We want what we do to be student-centered,” Deacon said. “We don’t want phony numbers that make us look better. We want what’s right for students. Going to college is not a transaction, it’s a personal experience.”

Seven Greenpeace activists have been charged with unlawful assembly, unlawful entry and destruction of property by the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department after climbing the top of a crane on a downtown D.C. construction site early yesterday morning to protest President Donald Trump’s approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, among other executive actions since he took office Jan. 20.
The protesters hung a 70-foot by 30-foot banner reading “Resist” from the crane, which was visible from the White House, a few blocks away.
The demonstration began at about 4:30 a.m., when the seven activists climbed up the crane. According to the MPD’s Twitter account, police were on the scene by about 6:30 a.m., closing sections of 15th St. and L St. NW for several hours out of safety concerns.
15th St. was reopened at about 8:45 a.m., but the 1500 block of L St. NW, which is directly adjacent to the construction site, remained closed.
The demonstration effectively ended at around 2:00 p.m., when protesters began rolling up and removing the banner as planned. However, protesters were forced to remain atop the crane for over 16 hours, the task of coming down a series of ladders waiting for them.
The climbers finally reached the ground around 10 p.m. and were immediately arrested. They were released Thursday afternoon with an initial status hearin set for Feb. 1.
The activists named a number of Trump’s policies as motivation for the high-profile protest, including environmental issues. In a Greenpeace press release provided to The Hoya, Pearl Robinson, a 26-year old national organizer for Rainforest Action Network, said issues ranging from clean energy to women’s rights prompted the protest.
“We won’t stand rollbacks on all the progress the people have made on women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQIA rights, the heightened awareness of state-sanctioned violence on black and brown folks and the progress we have made on access to clean and renewable energy — an issue I have personally worked on my entire adult life,” Robinson said.
The demonstration came just one day after Trump signed two executive orders to advance the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.
Both projects had previously been halted under the Obama administration after Standing Rock Indian Reservation members began a series of protests over concerns that the pipeline could impact their reservation.
Activist and Greenpeace Inc. Board Chair Karen Topakain said in the press release that the demonstration was intended as a public display of opposition to the Trump administration.
“It is plain that communities and cities across this country are alive with the spirit of resistance, the spirit of speaking out and the spirit of taking action,” Topakain said. “Our goal here today was to display a beacon of that spirit. Now that we’ve done that, it’s time to get to work.”
A statement posted to the MPD’s Twitter account called the protesters’ actions “dangerous and unlawful.”
“A small group of protesters have engaged in dangerous behavior in downtown Washington, D.C. this morning,” the statement reads. “While we respect everyone’s right to protest, today’s actions are extremely dangerous and unlawful. Multiple government resources are being tied up, and unfortunately streets are blocked while first responders try to safely address this matter.”
The protest was featured on social media, including a Facebook live video taken by one of the climbers. The video was posted on the Greenpeace Facebook page, and several activists also tweeted photos of themselves atop the crane with the hashtag #ResistOften.
Spectators and supporters watched and occasionally cheered on the activists throughout the day. One such supporter was Denise Woods, who cheered for part of the day despite not being directly associated with the protest.
“It’s absolutely heroic,” Woods said. “They have courage as vast as the mountains and deep as the seas to be up there right now. And it’s because of their love of the mountains and their love of the seas that they’re risking their lives on behalf of the planet.”

The Jewish community in the United States has experienced an uptick in anti-Semitism in the past few months, with two Jewish day schools in the Washington, D.C.-metro area being targeted with bomb threats Feb. 27, amid a wave of similar threats across the nation.
Charles E. Smith Jewish Day School in Rockville, Md., and Gesher Jewish Day School in Fairfax, Va., both received phone calls Monday morning that insinuated there was a bomb located in the school.
On Friday, FBI agents arrested Juan Thomas in St. Louis in connection to at least eight of the threats made, though he is not assumed to be the main suspect behind the wave of bomb threats.
Laurie Ehrlich, the director of marketing and communications at Charles E. Smith, said the upper school campus, for grades six through 12, received a threatening call just after the school day had begun.
“At 9:22 Monday morning, our front desk receptionist at our upper school campus received an automated message that there was a bomb in the building and that ‘Jewish souls would be destroyed,’” Ehrlich said.
Ehrlich said the school then followed established protocols and notified the police, who, after a swift arrival, conducted a thorough search of the campus and determined that no bomb was present.
“Police showed up in less than five minutes and they made the determination that the school did not need to be evacuated at that time,” Ehrlich said. “They had canine units that swept the building and determined it was a hoax, and by 10:40, the school had received the ‘all clear.’”
Rick Goodale, public information officer for the Montgomery County Police Department, said the department is investigating the threat and hoping to catch its perpetrator.
“We don’t want to give away any of the investigative methods that we use,” Goodale said. “I have not received any updates that anybody has been charged. Sometimes a phone number can be spoofed — sometimes tracking where these calls come from can be a lengthy process.”
Meanwhile, the Gesher Jewish Day School received a similar bomb threat at around the same time, according to Officer Don Gotthardt, spokesman for the Fairfax County Police Department.
“About 9:19 Monday morning, we received a call from Gesher Day School that they had received a bomb threat by phone that stated there was a bomb in the school,” Gotthardt said. “We immediately sent officers to the scene, and in talking to our officers, the school administrators decided to evacuate, so I’m told that 143 students and staff were evacuated while our officers searched the grounds and interior of the school. Fortunately, nothing suspicious was found. Our officers cleared the scene at 10:47.”
Gotthardt said that while he cannot disclose details about the investigation, Fairfax detectives are coordinating with other intelligence units throughout the country to reach the culprit or culprits of these threats.
“Our detectives will probably be in communication with investigative entities throughout the country just to look at any commonalities, similarities, differences, anything like that,” Gotthardt said. “The technical aspects of it, if there are any recordings saved or any means to identify the source of the call.”
The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department declined to comment on these incidents because they did not occur under its jurisdiction.
Ehrlich said students and parents were aware of the trend of bomb scares at Jewish centers before the phone call came.
“Students and parents have already been on alert. It’s not something you want to happen to you, but it did, that was ‘our’ day. There was definitely a sense of calm in the building when it was happening,” Ehrlich said.
Charles E. Smith has provided resources to parents and their children to cope with this attack, according to Ehrlich.
“We let our students know that if they have questions, please ask. Our principals of all three divisions — lower, middle and upper — did communicate with the parents on Monday evening and provided resources as to talk to children about the events that occurred,” Ehrlich said.
Gesher Jewish Day School could not be reached for comment.
Anti-Semitic incidents have become frequent and publicized since the election of President Donald Trump. Vice President Mike Pence visited a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis, which was the site of vandalism last week.
Trump addressed these incidents during his joint address to Congress on Feb. 28. He also mentioned the recent shooting of two Indian men in a Kansas City, Kan., bar that left one dead.
“Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms,” Trump said.
Georgetown University Director for Jewish Life Rabbi Rachel Gartner expressed concern — but not great surprise — over the increase in incidents.
“This is a really painful moment for me and for the Jewish community here and everywhere. We’re seeing an uptick of really vivid, horrible anti-Semitism. The sad reality is just like with Obama — racism wasn’t born with Obama,” Gartner said. “Anti-Semitism wasn’t born in this moment, it is just becoming more visible, and it’s a painful reminder of the undercurrent that has been there, unfortunately, for generations.”
Gartner said that while the Jewish community is not in an emergency situation, many Jewish students at Georgetown have come to her seeking dialogue and comfort.
“Students are more anxious, more pained, more sensitive. I’ve had more instances of people coming to me for pastoral care,” Gartner said.
Gartner also commended the Muslim community at Georgetown and at large for its support during this time.
“The Muslim community has been remarkable in its support. The Muslim students on this campus have reached out and said, ‘how can we support you?’” Gartner said. “Islamophobia and anti-Semitism are different issues, but they are not unrelated.”
Incidentally, Goodale said that while bomb threats against schools based on religious affiliation are somewhat rare, threats against Islamic centers have occurred previously in Montgomery County, Md.
“I can’t recall anything in recent memory at schools, but periodically we get threats at Islamic centers, that kind of thing. It does happen that we receive threats to religious facilities,” Goodale said.
Ehrlich said that the Jewish community at Charles E. Smith will persevere through Monday’s bomb threat and continue living their lives.
“Everything here on out is business as usual; we look forward to getting through the rest of the week,” Ehrlich said.

The Georgetown University Police Department has launched an investigation after posters were placed in several locations on and off campus by Identity Evropa, a white national group, Sunday night.
The posters, placed in locations including Red Square and Village A, included several white nationalist slogans, such as “Our destiny is ours,” “Serve your people,” and “Let’s become great again.” The group took credit for the posters on its Twitter account.
By Monday night, many of the posters had been taken down by students. GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said campus police were investigating the matter.
“We have recently been made aware of the posters,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are currently investigating this.”
The group, founded at California State University Stanislaus, has plastered posters at universities across the country, including the University of California, Los Angeles, Pennyslvania State University and the University of Washington. A past campaign at Indiana University specifically targeted the offices of professors of color.
The Southern Poverty Law Center identified the group as white nationalist on their website in February.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said in a statement to The Hoya the campaign is an act of hate.
“The posters appear to be part of a campaign by an outside group that has posted similar materials on campuses across the country. Acts of hate will not be tolerated on Georgetown’s campus,” the statement reads. “We are a community that welcomes all people and that values understanding, dignity, inclusion and respect.”
Georgetown University Student Association President-elect Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President-elect Jessica Andino (COL ’18) said the posters stray beyond the territory of free speech into harassment.
“We are appalled to see that these flyers that promote hate were spread across campus. Because of the hateful message that the organization embodies, this crosses the line of free speech into dangerous territory of harassment,” Mack and Andino wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are committed to promoting a tolerant speech environment where there is fruitful dialogue.”
Mack and Andino also encouraged students to use the university’s Bias Reporting System, which allows students to report bias incidents to the university.
“At this time we want to remind students that Georgetown has a Bias Reporting System if they feel any of their identities have been targeted in a threatening manner,” Mack and Andino wrote. “We would also like to emphasize the current guidelines of the Speech and Expression Policy as laid out by the university and to express that during our administration we plan to continue programming that informs the student body of these guidelines.”
The Georgetown Bipartisan Pro-Israel Dialogue denounced the posters and Identity Evropa in a post to the group’s Facebook page Monday.
“These individuals may be blinded by hatred and ignorance; the Georgetown population, however, is not,” the post reads. “For we are Georgetown, and we are one family. And no Hitler dress-up club can touch that.”

How are these acts of hate? The posters are of statues with text saying “Our Destiny is Ours,” “Serve Your People,” and “Let’s Become Great Again.” 
Seems pretty harmless.  Far from the harassment Kamar hysterically claims it to be.
And please explain how this is different from other race-based identity groups at Georgetown seeking to promote their own racial identity groups . . .
We have “The Black House” and “Casa Latina,” both race-based segregationist housing programs which put on programming with the specific goal promoting Black and Latino identity and which often put on anti-White events.
We have a ton of clubs devoted exclusively to the promotion of racial solidarity and advancement by race. They just happen to all be non-White races.  
Why is it only non-White groups are allowed to advocate for themselves or show pride in their history?
How come when a group of White people seek to care about their own race it’s all of a sudden bad thing?
If we believe the races are equal and should be treated equally, shouldn’t Whites be allowed the same rights and privileges non-Whites are allowed when it comes to supporting and identifying with their own racial groups?
If it’s wrong for Whites to be proud of their identity and the accomplishments of Whites and the many wonderful things Whites have done, and if Whites feeling solidarity for each other is wrong, then shouldn’t, if we believe in equality and equal treatment, condemn Black and Latino and Asian and Arab identity groups WHO DO THE EXACT SAME THING?
There is a huge double standard here, in addition to a lot of anti-White hate.
If you think it’s wrong for Whites to be proud of who they are but okay for other races to be proud of who they are, or if you think Whites shouldn’t help and promote each other based on race but think it’s okay for other races to help and promote each other based on race, then you’re a huge hypocrite.

The Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation announced 23 recipients of its annual GU Impacts fellowship alongside a series of changes to the program Monday.
The program, which sends students to work in social impact organizations for 10 weeks in the summer, is seeing a significant expansion this year, with the program almost doubling from last year’s 16 participants.
87 students completed the application this year., with a 26.4 percent acceptance rate. The program received 73 applications last year.
The 23 fellows will work at nine partner organizations in India, Nicaragua, Peru, the Philippines, Rwanda, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta. The fellows will also partake in fall past-programming that includes capstone presentations, reflections and career development.
Some of the new initiatives being piloted in the 2017 fellowship program include the addition of a graduate student from the Global Human Development program. The program is also debuting a partnership with the Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines, entrepreneurship collaboration space kLab, the Gashora Girls Academy for Science and Technology and Akazi Kanoze Access, a United States Agency for International Development-funded school, in Rwanda.
GU Impacts project manager Matthew Fortier said these changes are part of the program’s efforts to expand and reach more communities internationally.
“I’m really excited about the program this year because it’s the largest program to date,” Fortier said. “We also expanded the number of partnerships, and with that we are entering new geography — we are working in East Africa, specifically in Rwanda, for the first time, and we’re placing students in three different partnerships in the same country, which is really exciting.”
According to Fortier, one of the most important aspects of the program is how it teaches Georgetown students to apply what they learn in the classroom to real -life situations.
“Whether it’s working for a nonprofit, a for-profit, or a government initiative, students can apply the skills they learn in the classroom, and that will not only help them to refine their skills, but also to determine how to make the most their remaining time at Georgetown,” Fortier said.
According to Fortier, the program hopes to provide students with an experience that will stay with them through their time at Georgetown and beyond.
“The hope is that these experiences will be transformative and that students will take their experiences with them for the rest of their lives, and as they go on to make important decisions in the various positions that they hold, that this GU Impacts experience will stay with them and influence them in a positive way moving forward,” Fortier said.
Beatrice Hociota (MSB ’19), a GU Impacts alum who participated in a partnership with Mochila Digital in Managua, Nicaragua, and now serves as the program’s alumni mentor, said the program allowed her to combine her skills with her career interests to grow both personally and professionally.
“Through GU Impacts I was able to work in a business setting while also improving my Spanish speaking skills and learning about a different culture,” Hociota wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It gave me the opportunity to learn to be okay with being uncomfortable – both personally and professionally. The growth that I have been able to see in myself and in my peers as a result of this fellowship has been incredible.”
Louisa Christen (SFS ’19), who is part of the 2017 class of GU Impacts Fellows, will be working with Agora Partnerships in Managua, Nicaragua. Christen said GU Impacts is important because it empowers different groups around the world to exercise their innate potential.
“It is a fellowship that, as a whole, is dedicated to actualizing social change, leveling the playing field around the world and improving local communities,” Christen wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Though the program’s mission is carried out in the local community, its vision reaches much farther. In our globalized world, unlocked human potential undeniably comes around to impact all of us.”

The rift between Washington, D.C. leaders and the federal government has deepened as the House of Representatives passed an initial committee markup for the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Act, a federal school voucher program for D.C., on Wednesday.
The act was voted through by the U.S. House of Representative’s Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Wednesday, despite District leaders criticizing federal interference in the city.
SOAR, Washington D.C.’s federally funded school voucher program, provides vouchers to more than 1,100 low-income D.C. students to transfer from public schools to private schools. Since being passed by Congress in 2004, the program also has provided federal funding to traditional public schools and public charter schools in the District.
However, Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the District’s non-voting delegate to Congress, opposed the bill, saying the SOAR Program weakens the public education system and serves as a partisan grab by congressional the District to test a contentious policy on a community outside of their constituency.
“The most interesting question today is why Republicans consider the D.C. voucher program necessary in light of such a strong charter school alternative choice from the public schools,” Norton said. “There is very limited support for private school vouchers in the Congress and in the nation. When Republicans cannot pass controversial national legislation, they instead abuse their power over a jurisdiction they view as defenseless.”
President Donald Trump promised to expand state school voucher programs by $20 billion, while Trump’s Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is also a champion of school voucher programs.
The Opportunity Scholarship Program, the central program that regulates the voucher funds within the District, faced mixed support among congressional leaders during the committee meeting.
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) sponsored the bill, arguing that it provides educational opportunities for District students.
“Providing every possible opportunity for students to achieve the best education available ensures that the next generation is on a path to success,” Chaffetz said at the committee markup session. “This is exactly why this SOAR reauthorization act is so desperately needed for what it will do.”
House Democrats proposed amendments to ensure that private schools participating in the voucher program must obey civil rights laws and protect LGBTQ students and students with disabilities.
However, these amendments failed along party lines.
A majority of D.C. councilmembers have maintained their opposition to the program.
Councilmembers, including David Grosso (I-At Large), Anita Bonds (D-At Large), Charles Allen (D-Ward 6), Trayon White (D-Ward 8), Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), Vincent Gray (D-Ward 7), Brianne Nadeau (D-Ward 1) and Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), sent a letter Tuesday to Chaffetz encouraging the committee to phase out the SOAR program, temporarily extending the program to allow students currently receiving vouchers to graduate from high school.
The councilmembers cited a U.S. Department of Education study on the effectiveness of the scholarships administered through the SOAR program, finding that the program has no effect on student achievement on math and English assessments.
“Despite ample evidence that the Congressionally-imposed voucher program is ineffective, and while D.C. public schools improve every year, some members of Congress continue to see our city as their personal petri dish,” the letter reads. “With the new Administration and leadership in the Department of Education, it is even clearer that our public education system is and will remain under attack.”
The letter also references studies on school voucher programs from school systems in Ohio, Louisiana and Indiana. In each of the states, student scores on math and English assessments fell between 6 and 25 percent.
Mayor Muriel Bowser’s (D) Communications Director Kevin Harries said Bowser has been a long-time champion of the SOAR Act because it offers area students greater choice in pursuing their education and provides funds necessary to improving District of Columbia Public Schools.
“It will safeguard millions of dollars in federal funds the District currently receives for both DCPS and D.C. Public Charter Schools,” Harries wrote regarding SOAR in an email to The Hoya. “The legislation has been an asset in helping Washington, D.C., become the fastest improving urban school district in the country, with increasing enrollment and graduation rates. Her goal is to ensure we are doubling down on these successes and expanding opportunities to every child in the District.”
House Democrats proposed amendments to ensure that private schools participating in the voucher program must obey civil rights laws and protect LGBTQ students and students with disabilities. However, these amendments failed along party lines.
At a Feb. 2 press conference, Bowser argued the District has achieved a balance between charter school options and the traditional public school system.
“We have achieved a delicate balance that has worked for us,” Bowser said. “There’s enough choice for parents who want to go outside of their neighborhood schools and we have a robust investment in our traditional public neighborhood schools.”
Despite her support, Bowser maintained her opposition to increased federal government interference in local education policy as inappropriate.
“People who like to experiment with education have sometimes looked to Washington, D.C., as a place to try things,” Bowser said. “In my discussions with the president and people who are surrounding him regarding education policy, my message is, ‘We got it right in D.C.’”
Rachel Sotsky, the executive director of Serving Our Children, the organization that distributes OSP funds to District students, said she was glad to see a program extended that helps District students gain access to education.
“We believe it is important to reauthorize the program, and that the House bill is an excellent measure,” Sotsky wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The councilmembers also took issue with the committee’s interference into District policies, calling the congressional action a violation of the Home Rule Act of 1973, which grants the District the power to elect its own city council and pass legislation.
“It is insulting to our constituents that members of Congress, where D.C. has no voting representation, would push their personal agendas on our city in a way they could never do in their home states,” the letter reads. “Attacking D.C. Home Rule, including any expansion of the voucher program, is irresponsible governing on the part of Congress.
[…] March, the U.S. House of Representative’s Committee on Oversight and Government Reform approved reauthorization despite District leaders criticizing federal interference in the city. […]

American Indian populations continue to be adversely affected by the legacy of American colonialism, according to three Great Plains American Indians at a panel discussion on the historical injustices against American Indian peoples in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Monday.
“Less than nine percent of the population of South Dakota identifies itself as American Indian, but yet nearly a third of the population of the state’s prisons identify themselves as being American Indians,” educator David Plume said.  “There are some disproportion issues there that have been going on for generations now.”
The panel, titled “Justice in America for Native Americans,” consisted of Plume, South Dakota counsel for the American Indian social advocacy group Lakota People’s Law Project, Chase Iron Eyes and public health physician Jeffrey Henderson. The panel was moderated by Marc Howard, director of the Prisons and Justice Initiative at Georgetown, which facilitates research on mass incarceration.
Bette Jacobs, professor in the Department of Health Systems Administration, which co-sponsored the event, said historical neglect is still having an effect on conditions for the American Indian population today.
“Our country is an ancient homeland for 567 federally recognized tribes of American Indians. Early encounters with Europeans who believed they had discovered a new land failed to recognize our homeland. This occupation became a systematic injustice that reverberates today,” Jacobs said.
Iron Eyes, a member of the Lakota Sioux Tribe in North Dakota, said the U.S. justice system has undermined the power of Indian nations in carrying out their own ideas of justice.
“It is a very real legal, political and economic oppression that results in certain limitations, certain usurpations of authority from the native nation, not only to enforce law and order according to its own terms, but to define law and order,” Iron Eyes said.
Iron Eyes said the negative impact of colonization hundreds of years ago is manifested in the living conditions of thousands of American Indians on Indian reservations.
“There is much to learn from communities that have been impacted by the processes of colonization and we are all trying to navigate this reality,” Iron Eyes said. “There is no reason that reservations should be the most horrible in terms of quality of life, suicide rates, substance abuse rates, poverty rates.”
Henderson, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, said federal rather than state oversight of law enforcement matters has resulted in strict punishment of American Indians on reservations.
“One of the big issues in South Dakota is that tribal concerns for any one of the tribes that are in the state of South Dakota have historically been passed off by our state as a federal problem. Under the federal government, there are mandatory sentencing guidelines, that many times are more harsh than what the state laws are,” Henderson said.
Henderson said the disproportionate incarceration of American Indians is a result of the federal jurisdiction on reservations.
“This past Friday, I was at the Pennington County Jail, and on that day they had 567 inmates.  Roughly 50 percent of the jail population on that day were American Indian. We represent about 10 to 12 percent of the population of Rapid City. However, 30 percent of those are federal inmates, and this speaks to jurisdictional issues,” Henderson said.
Plume said members were moving to provide education opportunities for children of American Indians, but financial difficulties are still unavoidable.
“What we try to do in Pine Ridge is make college opportunities affordable. The problem is many people come back to the reservation and they are faced with things such as restitutions and financial obligations for family,” Plume said.
Professor and Director of the Prisons and Justice Initiative Mark Howard called on Americans not to overlook American Indians in discussions of criminal and social justice.
“The burden falls disproportionately on minorities and peoples of color,” Howard said. “No issue or no group is more neglected in conversations about criminal justice and prisons than Native Americans, who are disproportionately over-represented in the criminal justice system.”

When Shiv Jhangiani (MSB ’19) registered for a McDonough School of Business class last year billed as a course on entrepreneurship and venture capitalism, he did not expect he would end up a published author.
Jhangiani is one of 15 students whose books were published by New Degree Press after taking an McDonough School of Business course last semester, released his book, “1.3 Billion: A Football Revolution in the Making” to contribute to the development of football in India and launch his career in the sports industry in the Healey Family Student Center on Tuesday.
The 15 students had their books published after taking “Launching the Venture,” a course in the MSB that taught students how to launch their own businesses and write books on subjects about which they were most passionate.
Jhangiani presented his book at the annual Sant Jordi celebration, a Catalan celebration similar to Valentine’s Day, organized by the Spanish Department last Monday.
Since the release of his book, Jhangiani has launched his own sport advisory firm, Billion Dollar Food, a sports advisory company that aims to connect an interested party, whether a European football team, a worldwide brand or an individual investor, to Indian football.
Jhangiani said he has been passionate about football since he was young, when he aspired to being a professional football player. Serious knee injuries prevented his football career from materializing while young, but his passion for football and his homeland remains.
The book focuses on potential ways to develop football in India.
“The main parts to the book are where football is currently in India, where it needs to go, why the world needs Indian football and why India needs football,” Jhangiani said. “It looks at the issue from the outside: how European clubs, if they were to invest in Indian football, how they can do that, the different ways a big club can do it, a smaller club can do it and how that can impact Indian football.”
Jhangiani said his personal experience with football in India urged him to recognize the lack of development in the sport.
“I moved to India when I was 11, which is an age where you need to be playing football day in, day out if you want to be making it professionally. I found it really tough to find a place to play because there wasn’t a structure where the teams had youth clubs where people can come in to train everyday,” Jhangiani said.
Luck and the right connections enabled him to play at the right level, according to Jhangiani.
“I didn’t really get anything through the football system in India. I just got very lucky in the people that I met and was really in the right place in the right time and that is how I got my opportunity to move to France,” Jhangiani said. “I was given a trial by a football team in France through an agent who is Indian.”
Jhangiani said he wants to develop a more formal structure for Indian football players to access resources to play professionally.
“There isn’t a whole infrastructure. There isn’t a whole setup for it and that is what needs to be developed right now,” Jhangiani said.
Jhangiani said the lack of academic material on Indian football was a source of difficulty.
“There are literally no books on football in India so I just did not know where to start,” Jhangiani said. “There is not a lot of material about Indian football apart from news articles which have come up very, very recently.”
Jhangiani has partnered with multiple departments on campus to promote the recent launch of his book, including the French and Spanish language departments and entrepreneurship groups at Georgetown.
Catalan lecturer Laura Vilardell, who managed the Q&A section of his book presentation, said the intersection between Indian football and international football interested her.
“We need more books like Shiv’s book because I think it gives you an image not only of Indian football, but also how it compares to all other leagues in the world,” Vilardell said. “It will probably be the first of many books about Indian football because it is a topic that a lot of people are interested in.”
Vilardell said Jhangiani’s research about the Spanish soccer team F.C. Barcelona made his book presentation pertinent to the Spanish department.
“I thought we should do something with the department because he is interested in La Masia and F.C. Barcelona. He had done some interviews with people who are part of the directive leadership of Barca. This is a very interesting link because of the heavy football culture Spain has,” Vilardell said.
Jhangiani has also sought links with India Initiative, a student and faculty-organized effort at Georgetown to advance teaching and research about India and world affairs.
India Initiative student fellow Yash Johri (SFS ’17) said Jhangiani’s book launch came at an opportune time for Indian sports.
“[The book] comes at an opportune time as India prepares to host the [FIFA] U-17 Football World Cup. There is a tremendous push by the government and businesses to gain the footballing world’s attention; one hopes that Jhangiani’s work also gets attention and that he can jump onto the bandwagon of world football’s next revolution,” Johri said.
The U-17 Football World Cup is a competition for football players under 17 years of age.
So far, Jhangiani has sold over 100 e-books on pre-release through Amazon and is hoping to sell as many paperbacks as possible. He intends to pursue partnerships with consulting firms Deloitte and Credit Suisse to buy mass numbers of books.
Jhangiani said he wants to use his book to help him break into the sports management industry, setting himself apart from most of his MSB peers.
“I wanted to use the book to get my foot into the sports industry because it’s not an industry like banking or consulting where there is a path drawn out for you and you just follow it,” he said. “I want to prove to the world of sports why I deserve to have my place in that world. But I want to sell as many copies as possible to raise awareness about Indian football.”

Georgetown’s admissions yield for the Class of 2021 jumped to 49 percent this year, following a record low in the university’s acceptance rate and an all-time high in applications received.
The university’s admissions yield refers to the number of accepted students who submit an enrollment deposit and plan to attend Georgetown in the fall. This year’s rate is a two-percent increase from last year’s 47 percent.
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions’ target enrollment for the entire Class of 2021 increased this year for the first time in seven years to 1,600, up 20 spots from last year. Out of the 3,310 students offered admission for the Class of 2020, 1,633 enrolled, according to Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Charles Deacon (CAS ’64, GRD ’69).
Deacon said the increase in the yield rate is a positive sign for the university, given the record number of applications Georgetown received this year.
With 1,633 students already enrolled, Deacon projects that around 40 students will be accepted from the waiting list. Currently, about 75 of 100 students offered a spot on a wait list remain. All students will receive a final answer by the end of June.
“We have already made some activity on the waiting list,” Deacon said. “We have admitted 25 people from the waiting list. Last year at this time, it was 80. So therefore, one of the results of having a better yield is having few spaces left for the waiting list.”
The admissions office received 21,459 regular decision applicants to the Class of 2021, up 7.3 percent from the 19,997 applicants Georgetown received in 2016. Georgetown later accepted a record-low 15.4 percent of applicants, an overall 3,310 students.
Deacon said the university offered enrollment to 1,675 students, anticipating about 75 admitted students to defer or withdraw their place because of a gap year, illness or financial constraints.
The incoming class represents every state except North Dakota and a record 172 black students, up 30 from last year. The number of Asian students and Hispanic students also increased from 206 to 227 and 169 to 183, respectively.
The incoming class’ average SAT scores increased to 1411, up eight points from last year, representing a highly accomplished incoming class.
“Considering the fact that the pool went up and the class being enrolled is 1411 in SAT versus 1403 — that’s eight points higher — it’s a stronger group, but our yield was higher,” Deacon said in an interview with The Hoya. “So that is really good, and the result is very few waitlist admits.”
Deacon also reported high yield rates in students admitted to the Community Scholars Program, a five-week academic summer program for first-generation college students, and the Georgetown Scholarship Program, a university program that provides financial support for over 625 undergraduates, many of whom are first-generation students, through access to resources and support networks.
The CSP reported a 75 percent yield, with 15 more students planning to enroll than expected, while 67 percent of students admitted to GSP and offered the program’s 1789 Scholarship, which offsets the cost of attendance usually covered by a student loan, plan to enroll.
“I don’t know if the word is out that Georgetown has a great program, but that’s the area that we did really well in,” Deacon said.
The number of foreign nationals enrolling in fall 2017 decreased slightly to 125 from last year’s 127.
Deacon said this small drop raises flags about future changes in international students considering Georgetown for higher education.
“The only number that didn’t tick up was the number of foreign nationals which is an interesting story — 125 versus 127. It didn’t go way down, but it didn’t go up,” Deacon said. “There’s been this issue about whether the climate in the country is going to impact at all the number of foreign nationals who want to come here. That number is interesting.”
Deacon said international student enrollment and applications have traditionally been driven by residents of China as a result of strong economic growth and interest in U.S. education, especially during the time span between 2004 and 2014 in which Georgetown saw a significant jump in international applications. Still, as Chinese interest in Georgetown slows, Deacon said the admissions office is looking to other Asian countries to attract.
“The large jump from 2004 to 2014 was largely influenced by China, and Asia in general. The economy in China is contracting; the growth there is probably peaking,” Deacon said. “Next is India, so we’re spending more time travelling to India. That population is particularly attuned to high-tech areas, and since we don’t have engineering, that’s probably going to limit how big a jump that will be for us.”
The total size of the student body will not change and remains tied to the 2010 Campus Plan’s 6,675 undergraduate student enrollment cap, meaning the admissions office shifted to accepting more freshmen than transfer students this cycle to fill the additional 20 seats in the Class of 2021. This increase reduced the number of transfer students accepted this year from 170 to 150 admits.
The undergraduate schools reported steady yields, with the McDonough School of Business recording the highest rate of 54 percent. The School of Foreign Service reported a 51 percent yield, the School of Nursing and Health Studies recorded a 49 percent yield and Georgetown College yielded 45 percent of its applicants.
Deacon said the MSB’s yield rate has leveled, mirroring the similar trend the MSB observed over the past two years in steady applicant numbers.
He said the lack of substantial growth in yield or applications for the MSB could reflect a shift in applicants’ interest for the humanities and social sciences, as Georgetown College experienced a bump in applicants this cycle, and a stabilizing job market and improving national economic environment.
“The pressure students were facing after the financial crisis was going into a program where they could get jobs afterward,” Deacon said. “It seems that that may be reversing a little bit. People see there is more uncertainty than there used to be. So committing to something fully as opposed to being just generally well-educated is something people are beginning to think about.”

Rep. Pramila Jayapal (CAS ’86), a Democrat from Washington, attributed her career and political success to her time as an immigrant and student at Georgetown during a discussion in the Intercultural Center Auditorium on Monday. 
Representing Washington’s 7th district — which includes much of downtown Seattle and its suburbs — Jayapal is the first Indian-American woman to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
The Georgetown University College Democrats, the Office of D.C. and Federal Relations, the Baker Scholars, the South Asian Society, the Georgetown Women’s Alliance, the LGBTQ Resource Center and the Institute of Politics and Public Service co-sponsored the event.
Jayapal first came to the United States from Chennai, India, to attend Georgetown as an undergraduate student to pursue a major in English literature. 
Jayapal reflected on the difficulties of assimilating into American culture, as well as the learning opportunities she found in her classes.
“That English literature major and the liberal arts education that I got here at Georgetown is the basis for everything that I do today,” Jayapal said. “It is the basis for how I think about issues, about rational perspectives that are part of my conversations. It’s about how I communicate, about how I write.”
After graduation, Jayapal worked in a range of fields before entering the public sector in 1991. She briefly worked on Wall Street, received a Master of Business Administration from Northwestern University and worked for a nonprofit based in Thailand and for an advertising firm in western Ohio and eastern Indiana. 
Jayapal said she benefitted from working in both the public and private sectors.
“Doing the jobs that you don’t want to do is actually just as important as doing the jobs that you do want to do, because it teaches you something about yourself and what is important to you,” Jayapal said.
After a two-year fellowship in India, Jayapal returned to the United States during the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, during which Muslims, Arabs and South Asians were persecuted and threatened with deportation. 
In response, she founded the nonprofit Hate Free Zone — now OneAmerica — and ultimately sued former President George W. Bush’s administration to stop the illegal deportation of 4,000 Somali immigrants and to end Arab and Muslim registration systems as part of her larger goals to reform the U.S. immigration system.
As an elected official, first in the Washington state senate and now as a congresswoman, Jayapal has worked to advance the rights of immigrants through the proposed Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors  Act and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, a program implemented during former President Barack Obama’s administration. 
Jayapal said she feels called toward a personal mission to further immigrant rights.  
“The fight is not just political; it is personal,” Jayapal said.
Once she entered public office, Jayapal found that she was often one of few women of color, if not the only one, in her sphere. 
Jayapal emphasized the importance of diversity in representation and in government. 
“The diversity of our experiences and our backgrounds and our voices mean that we do things differently,” Jayapal said. “We chair hearings differently, we craft different legislation, we tell different stories, we elevate different voices, we have connections to different communities. We expand our democracy, because we allow people to see themselves in us.”
Jayapal credits her devotion to public service to the sacrifices her parents made to send her to the United States for college. 
“It is that sacrifice that my parents made in allowing me to come here to Georgetown that is really the reason I’ve spent the rest of my life, the last 25 years of my life, fighting for other people to have opportunity,” Jayapal said. “If I learned one thing at Georgetown, it was that we human beings are in service to a greater good.”
GU College Democrats Chair Larry Huang (COL ’19) said the College Democrats invited Jayapal to speak at Georgetown because they thought her story would resonate with students who may have similar backgrounds. 
“We want to bring people to campus so that they can share their stories and inspire people,” Huang said. “People can see themselves in her shoes and in her story in a way that they wouldn’t be able to see in many other elected officials.”

The Georgetown University School of Foreign Service will host four former diplomats and politicians this semester as the inaugural class of Centennial Fellows.
Former Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser S. Judeh; former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration Anne C. Richard (SFS ’82); former U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Verma and former Guatemalan magistrate Claudia Escobar will partake in panels and discussions, lend their expertise in classes and interact with Georgetown students.
The fellows will also work directly with SFS students selected as Junior Fellows. The groups of fellows will work together to organize a larger event, potentially a lecture or panel discussion, for the entire Georgetown community.
Richard said she was honored to enter this role at her alma mater and was amused at the prospect of working alongside Judeh, with whom she previously crossed paths as a student and professional.
“We ended up at conferences alongside each other, and I worked with his staff, and he was also very close to my bosses, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry,” Richard said. “So it’s funny that we were both at Georgetown as undergrads in the 1980s, and now we’re both back as Centennial Fellows.”
Executive Director of the SFS Centennial Will Layman said the fellows will contribute diversity and expertise to Georgetown.
“The program is bringing important global practitioners to SFS and Georgetown, inviting them to bring their expertise to the campus and bringing them into contact with students and professors,” Layman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “You can see in this first group of fellows great range in geography, strategic issues and method of engagement, and their passion to interacting with students and the community at large is unmistakable.”
According to Layman and SFS Senior Associate Dean Anthony Arend, the fellows were first nominated by SFS faculty, then reviewed by an Advisory committee of undergraduate and graduate student and faculty representatives. SFS Dean Joel Hellman ultimately selected the final group of fellows.
Layman also said that the Centennial Fellows Program would bolster dialogue on important international issues, further cementing Georgetown as a leading institution.
“The Hilltop has always been a place where the big conversations can take place about the critical global issues,” Layman wrote. “The Centennial Fellows Program brings important voices to campus, amplifying Georgetown’s position as a leader in America’s most important international city.”
The SFS also launched the Junior Centennial Fellows Program in conjunction with the Centennial Fellows, allowing undergraduate and graduate students in the SFS to work on research and events with the fellows.
Arend said the program reflected the ideals upon which the SFS was founded.
“Appropriately enough, as the school celebrates its Centennial, it provides us an opportunity to reimagine how the school should adapt in preparing people for this new world,” Arend said. “In many respects it is the same question that Edmund A. Walsh was proposed in 1919 when the school was being created.”
Arend said that the Centennial Fellows program represents an opportunity to further students’ learning and comprehension of the complex world that lies beyond Georgetown.
“One thing we wish to do in the Centennial is to once again look at the world, a very changing and tumultuous world, and say ‘How can we best prepare people for this uncertain world?’” Arend said. “One way that we do it is bringing in distinguished practitioners of international affairs and provide them opportunities to interact with students, faculty and staff.”
With this in mind, Arend said the fellows’ different trajectories contributes to a larger picture of international affairs and politics.
“Someone like Nasser Judeh had to deal with the whole gamut of foreign affairs issues. Someone like Anne Richard dealing with migration, population and refugees as a focus is also a really critical part of international affairs — especially today,” Arend said. “Claudia Escobar is someone who is dealing with important human rights issues and questions of governance and corruptions, and Ambassador Richard Verma brings not only an understanding of the foreign policy process, but also the understanding of the domestic process whereby foreign policy is made in the US.”
Clare Ogden, program administrator of the Centennial Fellows Program, echoed Arend’s views on the importance of the fellows in helping the school reimagine education on foreign affairs.
“When SFS was founded in 1919, its goal was to address an uncertain, changing world. Today, the world is no less tumultuous and uncertain,” Ogden wrote in an email to The Hoya. “What the Centennial Program hopes to do is bring thinkers and practitioners to help the school re-imagine how Georgetown can best address a changing world and better prepare students and scholars to confront it.”

Late-night sessions in Lauinger Library, exploring the monuments and adjusting to unfamiliar weather patterns are new experiences not only for many first-year and transfer students, but also for five School of Foreign Service in Qatar students studying at Georgetown’s Washington, D.C. campus this semester.
The five students showcase the diverse student body on SFS-Q’s campus. They hail from India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Syria and Massachusetts. Massachusetts native Katharine Danilowicz (SFS-Q ’19) has lived in Panama, Bangladesh and Pakistan due to her father’s diplomatic career. It is her first time in the United States since fourth grade.
Danilowicz said she wanted to learn more about life on the Hilltop after hearing about it from her family.
“My grandfather, father and brother all went to Georgetown, so I very much felt like I had to get some of the Hilltop experiences they always talked about,” she said. “What I’ve enjoyed the most is just having the D.C. experience. Finally getting jokes about Lau, complaining about Leo’s, eating sandwiches at Wisey’s and getting to check out interesting places in D.C. with experiences we wouldn’t get in Doha,” Danilowicz said.
For Ritica Ramesh (SFS-Q ’19), who was raised in Qatar, the resources provided for her major of study determined her choice to study on the main campus.
“I’m pursuing a certificate in American Studies, and my major focuses on American diplomacy, and I figured it would be a great experience to study in D.C,” she said. “My personal interests lie in criminal justice, and there are a lot of avenues and classes available in D.C. to pursue that interest.”
A Rocky Transition
Established 12 years ago, SFS-Q is located in Doha’s University City, an area of concentrated higher education centers including branches of universities such as Texas A&M University, Virginia Commonwealth University, Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University and Northwestern University.
Ten students from Doha are currently on campus this semester, according to SFS Assistant Dean Lisa Gordinier. Every semester, Gordinier is tasked with facilitating the transition for students from Doha. The summer session always sees the most students visiting from Qatar’s campus, with approximately 30 students, Gordinier said.
The transfer students attend information sessions at the beginning of their semesters on the main campus, which explain university services such as Counseling and Psychiatric Services and the Academic Resource Center. All SFS-Q exchange students are invited to take part in New Student Orientation and the international pre-orientation program.
Danilowicz said the university’s resources eased the transition, though the weather has required an adjustment, as have the relatively spartan dorms.
“The weather has definitely shocked me the most. It’s already starting to get way too cold for me and it is only October,” Danilowicz said. “Also, they definitely spoil us with the dorms back in Doha. Our dorms are compared to hotels and we never have a roommate. So this was the first time I’ve had a roommate. She’s great, and it’s been a great experience, but it definitely is new.”
Different Campuses, Different Cultures
Though academic life is comparable on both campuses, the D.C. campus offers more outlets for socializing and meeting new people, Hunain Ali (SFS-Q ’19) said.
“Campus life at main campus is much better. It is way more active and lively than GU-Q,” Ali said. “Most of the students at main campus live in dorms, so it makes sense as to why it is more active. Academically, I would say it is pretty much the same.”
Class sizes and relationships with professors set the two campuses apart, according to Ramesh.
“In Qatar, the classes are smaller and you have a much closer relationship with your professors. You eat lunch with them, you go to events with them, you spend a lot of time with them — in a way, they become your friends, too,” she said. “That’s something that always blows my mind because you have these top-tier academics, and they’re personally invested in your success and educational journey at a very micro level.”
Ramesh said D.C. has a distinctive atmosphere of advocacy, which the Doha campus lacks but makes up for in school pride.
“There’s also a culture of advocacy and activism on campus here that also goes beyond just Georgetown and infiltrates the general D.C. community. In Qatar, we do most of our advocacy within Georgetown. But, at the end of the day, we still have as much Hoya Pride as they do here, and we still Bleed Hoya Blue, so that common link is great,” she said.
Syria native Jamal Khatib (SFS-Q ’19) moved to Boston with his family when the civil war broke out in 2011. Khatib said the recruitment opportunities drew him to spending a semester at Georgetown D.C., but he did not realize how competitive and cutthroat the recruitment process would be.
“I chose to study abroad this semester primarily because I heard the recruitment connections and opportunities here are much stronger. I wanted to use this time to secure a summer internship in New York,” Khatib said. “The process was really exhausting, I was constantly going to information sessions, networking events, interviews and dinners with prospective bosses, which was a lot.”
U.S. students can be intimidating to approach, according to Ali.
“Students at Qatar campus are much more approachable and easy to talk to. But again, maybe I’m not aware of the American culture and how things work here,” he said. “I thought it would be much easier to socialize and meet new people here than in Qatar.”
Danilowicz said that there is a similarity that links Hoyas from both campuses.
“At the end of the day, both campuses are full of Georgetown students who are incredibly intelligent and passionate and who are working to do amazing things and improve their communities,” she said. “That’s core to what Georgetown is and, despite the fact that each campus caters to different populations, it’s key to who their students are and what they want to do.”

President Donald Trump’s incoherent policies on China and North Korea threaten international stability, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice argued in a webcast for the National Committee on United States-China Relations’ 2017 CHINA Town Hall.
Georgetown University’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs hosted the town hall as part of a nationwide dialogue at 85 different locations Wednesday night. The address was sponsored by the university’s Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues, which fosters research and dialogue on matters of transnational importance.
Rice answered questions from Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, as well as questions emailed and tweeted by the national audience.
Rice condemned Trump for escalating tensions and risking conflict with North Korea through aggressive rhetoric. Trump has tweeted multiple insults directed at North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, and threatened to “totally destroy” the country in his first United Nations address Sept. 21.
“The extremely heated rhetoric of President Trump, the threats that he was leveling — ‘fire and fury’ and the like, which were matching or exceeding the young Kim Jong Un’s rhetoric — was one, inappropriate, and two, dangerous. It risked precipitating miscalculation and inadvertent conflict,” Rice said.
At Georgetown’s event, Rice’s address was preceded by a conversation between Dennis Wilder, the Initiative’s managing director, and J. Bradford Jensen, professor and McCrane/Shaker Chair in International Business at the McDonough School of Business.
According to Rice, Trump’s criticisms of China’s permissive policy approach toward North Korea, threats to impose tariffs on Chinese exports and January phone conversation with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen during his transition into office have contributed to a lack of cooperation with China in addressing the North Korea threat.
“The U.S.-China relationship works best when there’s a high degree of communication and maximized mutual understanding at the highest levels,” Rice said. “I think that President Trump came in with some pretty hot rhetoric around China that left the Chinese side not clear about what our intentions were.”
“It is hard to find coherence in this strategy right now,” Wilder said.
Rice said that the United States should handle North Korea’s mounting nuclear capacity in the same way that it previously handled the nuclear-armed Soviet Union.
“We can manage this problem — if we must — through robust deterrence, in the same way we managed the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War,” Rice said.
Trump will travel to Asia on Nov. 3 and stay until Nov. 14. An Oct. 16 White House press release confirmed visits to South Korea and China as part of the official trip.
According to the press release, Trump will call upon the international community to “come together and maximize pressure” on North Korea in an address to the South Korean National Assembly scheduled for Nov. 7. He will meet with China’s president, Xi Jinping, the following day.
“The North Korean issue will dominate the president’s trip to East Asia, no question at all,” Wilder said.
Rice said that China’s rapid economic growth should not threaten U.S. interests if addressed appropriately. China is the second-largest economy in the world by GDP and was the world’s fastest-growing economy until 2015, when it was overtaken by India.
“We need to recognize that China is going to continue rising. Its economy, its population, its capacity ensure that it will be and remain a very powerful country for the foreseeable future,” Rice said. “I believe that with wise and thoughtful leadership on the United States’ part — steady leadership — that we can manage a world in which China grows and continues to prosper.”
Jensen, however, said China’s growth would eventually flatten as economic expansion is only sustained after countries first promote industrial production, female participation in the labor force, educational opportunities and physical infrastructure.
Both Rice and Jensen cautioned that the United States’ withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership will affect the political and economic dynamic with the countries in the Asian-Pacific region that are bound to the treaty, as well as China, which had expressed interest in joining. Trump formally withdrew the United States from the TPP, which had not been approved by Congress and never took effect, shortly after taking office in January.
“I think the power dynamic is shifting. It is not shifting in the United States’ favor,” Rice said. “The decision to cancel U.S. participation in TPP, I think, was an extremely big mistake.”
Jensen echoed Rice’s concerns.
“For people who watch trade, you know, we hope the next four years will be short and that the damage will be minimal, but it seems increasingly likely there will be damage,” Jensen said.
With China being an important world player in matters ranging from trade and climate change to cybersecurity, Rice said that she hoped the Trump administration would improve, instead of strain, relations with the country.
“I hope very much that the Trump administration is looking for areas where we can expand our cooperation, not just points of friction,” Rice said.

“Hard-headedness and empathy” — this seemingly paradoxical combination of qualities informed the foreign policy of former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) at a time when the United States was surging as a unilateral world power, argued foreign policy experts Monday in Copley Formal Lounge.
The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union saw the erosion of the bilateral system of international relations that governed the post-World War II world, poising the United States to increase its influence under Clinton’s lead. Clinton’s extraversion and persistence helped to achieve that goal, according to three experts who worked with his administration.
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and former Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott comprised a panel on Clinton’s vision of the world and the foreign policy agenda it inspired. The event, co-sponsored by the School of Foreign Service and moderated by SFS Dean Joel Hellman, was part of the “Clinton 25: Georgetown Reflects on the Vision of Bill Clinton” symposium hosted by the Institute of Politics and Public Service.
As an SFS graduate and a Rhodes scholar, Clinton had studied international relations extensively by the time he arrived at the Oval Office. Talbott said Clinton’s focus was ensuring lasting stability.
“He came into office wanting to do everything he could to make sure that the Cold War was over and that post-Soviet Russia would be able to succeed,” Talbott said.
Albright said that through the 1994 Partnership for Peace, a NATO program aimed at increasing trust in European and former Soviet states, Clinton showed Russia a sign of respect.
At the negotiating table, the panelists said, Clinton pursued a “mission rich in diplomacy and engagement.” He complemented this mission with a proclivity for empathy, Zedillo said, citing Clinton’s support for the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement to improve the region’s economy.
NAFTA, which set up a free trade zone among Canada, the United States and Mexico, is currently being renegotiated by the administration of President Donald Trump, who called the agreement “the worst trade deal” during his 2016 presidential campaign.
Clinton believed it was in the national interest to bring financial stability to the region, Zedillo said. The former president sidestepped the U.S. Congress in 1995 to authorize a $20 billion loan to Mexico through the Department of the Treasury.
Clinton’s administration is also remembered for the 2000 Camp David summit among the American, Israeli and Palestinian premiers, during which the parties attempted to broker territorial disputes, the status of refugees and the elimination of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
Despite not being able to reach a watershed agreement, Clinton aimed to foster understanding between the parties, according to Albright, who participated in the 13-day negotiations.
“He made it a point of sitting down both with [Palestinian Authority] Chairman [Yasser] Arafat and with [Israeli] Prime Minister Ehud Barak and made them put themselves into the shoes of the other party,” Albright said. “That was kind of his way of saying, ‘We have to solve this together; it had to be win-win and not zero-sum.’”
Perhaps one of the Clinton administration’s most notable foreign policy moments remains the 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea, through which an international consortium was set to replace North Korea’s plutonium reactor with two light-water reactors.
The talks broke down after incoming Secretary of State Colin Powell of the George W. Bush administration “got hauled into the White House” and was told the negotiations must cease, according to Albright.
The Clinton administration also drew heavy criticism from its decision not to intervene in Rwanda, where 800,000 members of the Tutsi ethnic group were massacred by Hutus in 1994.
Talbott, who went on to preside over the Brookings Institution for 15 years, said Clinton was also instrumental in convincing former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to de-escalate conflict at the India-Pakistan border in 1999. The former president spent his Fourth of July weekend negotiating the demilitarization of the border, averting possible nuclear war.
But it is impossible to encompass eight years of foreign policy in one three-person panel, Hellman said. The conversation thus “wasn’t so much an assessment of the era as an assessment of the man” and how Clinton used his global influence.
In international relations parlance, this analysis of an individual’s vision has a name: the great man or woman theory, which states that foreign policy can be explained by the impact of individuals.
“Russia had a critical role to play in the world and … how it used its strength and potential was largely a function first of [former Russian President Boris] Yeltsin and then [President Vladimir] Putin taking it in a different direction,” Hellman said, echoing Talbott’s assessment that appointing Putin was Yeltsin’s biggest regret.
For Albright, the foreign affairs lesson from the Clinton presidency is the linkage between international engagement and domestic policy gains: The United States needed to become an “indispensable nation” in the eyes of the world to advance its own interests.
“What I’m worried about is that we are about to become the dispensable nation, where nobody thinks that we do have a role to play,” Albright said. “I would hope that the president, the current one, would understand that what he is trying to accomplish requires the United States to be engaged in a respectful way and stop tweeting.”

Anne Steen, the executive director of Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Graduate Career Center, remembers the hours professor Howard Schaffer would spend in group sessions or in one-on-one meetings to walk students through the U.S. Foreign Service Officer Test, giving them specific advice on how to pass.
“Bottom line, he seemed to love the Foreign Service and wanted to help the next generation find their place in diplomatic public service,” Steen wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Schaffer, an adjunct professor in the SFS and former director of studies at Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, died Nov. 17 aged 88.
The former ambassador to Bangladesh spent 36 years working in the Foreign Service as a leading specialist on South Asia. After ending his career in diplomacy in 1991, Schaffer worked at Georgetown as an adjunct professor for over two decades.
Schaffer died from congestive heart failure, his son Michael Schaffer told The Washington Post. Schaffer is survived by his wife, Teresita Schaffer, who is also an adjunct professor at Georgetown and former ambassador to Sri Lanka.

Schaffer, who graduated from Harvard University in 1950, joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1955, where he worked as a political and economic officer in India and Pakistan, becoming an expert on South Asian foreign policy. He served two terms as deputy assistant secretary of state of South Asian affairs before his appointment as ambassador.
Schaffer was one of 29 diplomats to sign the 1971 “Blood telegram,” a first-of-its-kind State Department dissent cable that criticized U.S. complicity in a brutal Pakistani crackdown in East Pakistan, which soon became the independent state of Bangladesh, reported The Washington Post on Sept. 23.
In Academia 
Schaffer began his work at the ISD in 1996, where he ran several student programs including the Key Global Issue Seminar, a weekly seminar with speakers on global topics relating to diplomacy for foreign service graduate students and ISD associates. He stepped down from this position in 2011.
Schaffer also wrote two books on U.S.-South Asian foreign policy, as well as two biographies of American ambassadors to India. Acting in his role at the ISD and as an adjunct professor, Schaffer also taught a popular class titled “Practicing Diplomacy Abroad,” which he was slated to teach this fall semester. Schaffer’s wife took over the class when he became ill earlier this fall.
Arsalan Suleman (SFS ’03), one of Schaffer’s former students and current fellow at the ISD, said Schaffer’s expertise made his commitment to his students all the more valuable.
“He was an accomplished diplomat and serious regional expert, but also someone who was very humble and approachable, who appreciated various cultures, including campus cultural events like Rangila, and who took great interest in his students’ development and careers,” Suleman wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Beyond the Classroom
Jim Seevers, the director of studies at the ISD, said Schaffer had a profound influence on the Georgetown community.
“This is really a great loss to Georgetown and the School of Foreign Service,” Seevers said. “Professor Schaffer was a terrific professor, committed to teach his students about the art of diplomacy and foreign policy in South Asia. He was a wonderful colleague and a wonderful teacher, and he’s going to be missed dearly at Georgetown.”
Many of Schaffer’s colleagues and students highlighted his commitment to helping students and training them to pass the FSOT. Anthony Arend, senior associate dean for graduate and faculty affairs in the SFS, also discussed Schaffer’s level of personal investment in seeing his students pass the FSOT.
“He would always contact me afterwards and tell me how well they went, and he would be really excited when these students passed the foreign service exam,” Arend wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I just remember how devoted and how happy he was to work with students to prepare for that exam.”
Casimir Yost, former director of the ISD, also said that Schaffer was known for his positive relationships and interactions with those around him.
“When I think of Ambassador Schaffer, I very much think of the human dimension; he was an incredible people person with a wry sense of humor,” Yost said. “I think there were echoes of that in his class, because every time I spoke to a student and said ‘How’s Ambassador Schaffer’s course going?’ invariably the answer was, ‘It’s just a terrific course, and he’s so invested in it.’”
Arjun Pant (SFS ’09), one of Schaffer’s former research assistants, said the former ambassador truly cared for and believed in his students, even trusting them to help him while he wrote his books.
“He will be remembered as a professor who was truly dedicated to teaching and to his students, and someone who was looked up to as a wise mentor for those aiming to enter the field of diplomacy,” Pant said.

A discount food ordering app designed by Georgetown students Aaron Rutter (COL ’20) and Sahaj Sharda (SFS ’20) launched this week.
The app, Dynos, works with local Georgetown restaurants to provide students with access to discounted food during restaurant off hours. According to Rutter, the app uses the principle of supply and demand to give its users discounts.
“The app dynamically prices food at restaurants based off of supply and demand. So that means that it discounts food,” Rutter said. “So if a bakery has, like, 20 leftover pastries at the end of the day, they’ll end up throwing them out, so the thought was, why waste food, and instead allow them to make some money on it.”
Users can use the app to order food from local restaurants like Wingos, Georgetown Gourmet and Dog Tag Bakery at a discounted rate. Three to four-hundred people have joined the service in the app’s first week.
The idea for Dynos was born after Sharda travelled to India the summer after his freshman year. While in a local market with his grandfather, Sharda was struck by the bartering process over goods between vendors and shoppers.
“My grandfather took me to a market, and it’s very interesting because it was a bazaar where there were no fixed prices on anything,” Sharda said. “What I noticed was, over the hours, there’s a small little stand that was selling some sorts of delicate foods, and over the hours people would come up and they would negotiate and as it came to times that were away from lunch or dinner, the prices would go down substantially, and they would go back up later.”
After that day in the market, Sharda called Rutter, asking him to co-found an app that would allow restaurants and students to benefit from price fluctuations. Because neither Rutter nor Sharda had tech experience, they reached out to members of the Georgetown faculty for help. One of their advisers was economist and Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy professor George Akerlof.
Akerlof said the app is beneficial to both students and restaurants.
“They are taking advantage of the fact that the restaurants have times when the marginal cost to them of an extra customer is much less than at other times, and therefore if the app attracts extra customers at those times the restaurants are willing to give them a break (i.e. a discount),” Akerlof wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It is a Dynos-generated win for the restaurants, win-for-the-students.”
Rutter and Sharda also consulted with Eric Burger, a Georgetown research professor of computer science. Burger said he encouraged the students to formulate a business plan and tap into a market.
“I did, you know, help encourage them to find someone to actually do the programming, but more about how to start a business, how to get a business plan going, how to kind of find a market,” Burger said.
In addition to consulting with professors, Rutter and Sharda spoke to Loren Sumerlin, who runs the Auxiliary Services at Georgetown. Sumerlin provided them with insight on how to pitch their app to restaurants. The co-founders also worked with Students of Georgetown, Inc. on development and marketing strategies.
Rutter said he has noticed a lot of the support from the Georgetown community has emerged from a desire to promote a technologically savvy culture on campus.
“What we’ve noticed so far, not just from professors, but sort of from speaking to administration, like people in the administration, is they’re all really for the app, not for, not specifically because they like the idea, but it’s more so because they want to sort of like brand Georgetown as like a tech-friendly environment,” Rutter said.
While Dynos is seeing an increasing number of users, Rutter and Sharda are not currently making money from the app.
“The tough part with the app is that we’re sort of in this food space where we’re competing with Uber Eats and also Grub Hub,” Rutter said. “We’re not charging them a monthly fee to be on the app. That’s all things we hopefully can do in the future once we’ve like made a name for ourselves. But in terms of how we make money, we right now don’t have any cash flow coming in. We only have user flow.”
Rutter and Sharda hope to begin profiting from their app soon and expand the restaurant list to the Washington, D.C. area including American University and The George Washington University.
Sharda wants other Georgetown students to develop their entrepreneurship skills.
“I don’t know if creating an app necessarily is what I would recommend,” Sharda said. “But, broadly I think the core tenets that I would recommend that every student here at Georgetown, broadly, try to develop is entrepreneurship.”

Giving a face to immigrants without documentation is essential to advocating for their rights, Cardinal Joseph Tobin said during a visit to Georgetown University on Monday.
Tobin, the archbishop of Newark, N.J., John Carr, director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown, Mizraim Belman Guerrero (SFS ’20) and Habon Ali (SFS ’18) discussed the role of the church in advocating for refugees and immigrants without documentation in a Dahlgren Chapel panel discussion.
Before the panel, Tobin and Carr held a press briefing in Maguire Hall on the same topic.
The Dahlgren Dialogues, a series of discussions on social justice, are organized by Georgetown University’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life.
Tobin said religious leaders must voice their support for immigrants to affirm their humanity to the public.
“If we recognize the humanity of a person, we find it much more difficult to treat them inhumanely. And so why I think it’s important religious leaders stand with immigrants is to put a face on them, so people who want to do inhumane things know what they’re doing,” Tobin said at the press briefing.
Tobin said the issue of supporting students without documentation is moral, but also inherently political — which is not a problem, in his view.
“I don’t think the [Catholic] Church is barred from commenting on political issues,” Tobin said during the press briefing. “There is a distinction between the political sphere and the religious. But that distinction begins to diminish when you begin to look at what both are purportedly about, and that’s the common good. It’s about human flourishing. It’s about men and women at their best, so we have an interest in the polis, which is the common good.”
Tobin advocated a legislative replacement for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an executive program established in 2012 by the Obama administration that provide work authorization and legal protection to about 800,000 immigrants without documentation who came to the United States as children.
However, Tobin warned that a legislative compromise could lead to a bill with provisions with negative outcomes for immigrants.
“I personally feel we should hold out for a clean DACA because I’m very concerned. And I think I’m not simply being hysterical, if you examine the budget proposals, the administration is preparing for a mass deportation,” Cardinal Tobin said at a press briefing. “If we accept a deal uncritically thinking that’s all we can get, well, then we may be establishing a foundation that will result in a greater harm.”
Following a 2015 terrorist attack in Paris for which the Islamic terror group ISIS claimed responsibility, 31 state governors, including then-governor of Indiana and current Vice President Mike Pence, attempted to bar Syrian refugees from entering their states.
Tobin, who was at the time the archbishop of Indianapolis, requested to meet with Pence in order to introduce him to an Iraqi immigrant and naturalized citizen. Tobin said he wanted to show Pence the types of people his actions would affect.
“My intention was to say, ‘This is what a refugee looks like,’” Tobin said during the Dahlgren Dialogue. “He was very happy to explain to the governor all he was doing and how much he loves his job as a coffee manager.”
Belman Guerrero echoed Tobin’s sentiment.
“What I tried to emphasize in my remarks was the need to continue to humanize the conversation,” Belman Guerrero wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Another point that I highlighted is the need to stop looking for the ‘perfect immigrant’ and to focus on the humanity of each individual migrant.”
“If you’re talking about human beings, statistics are going to rob them of their face,” Tobin said during the press briefing.
Tobin illustrated his point with a quote attributed to Mark Twain: “There are three types of lies: Lies, damned lies, and statistics.”
Since leaving Indiana to come to the East Coast, Tobin said he has continued to focus on ways he can use his role to help immigrants without documentation.
“I asked every parish in the archdiocese to have a workshop that informs undocumented [immigrants] what their rights really are,” Tobin said during the press briefing. “Secondly, it’s working with coalitions of very generous attorneys to give, to the best of our ability, guaranteed representation.”
Tobin traces back his motivation to help undocumented immigrants to his Catholic faith and to his upbringing.
“People of goodwill wonder why the most helpless and vulnerable people of society are subjected to the most inhumane treatment,” Tobin said during the press briefing. “We felt it was part of our mission as the Catholic community to find a home [for those] who were fleeing from violence.”
During the Dahlgren Dialogue, Tobin recounted growing up in a diverse Detroit neighborhood and his attraction to the church for its willingness to stand with people of all origins.
Tobin also acknowledged the deep-rooted compassion for immigrants that exists within the Catholic faith, referencing a verse in the Book of Exodus – you shall not wrong an alien, “for you once were aliens,” Tobin said.

When Sahil Nair (SFS ’19) and Naba Rahman (SFS ’19) first met on a national debate circuit their senior year of high school, they never would have anticipated that four years later they would run in the Georgetown University Student Association’s 2018 executive election.
The pair promises to amplify student voices, running on the campaign slogan “Because Every Voice Matters.” Nair and Rahman have defined the executive’s primary role as facilitating students’ efforts and ideas. With limited GUSA experience and a less detailed policy platform compared to their opponents’, they are seeking to sell voters on their outside leadership roles and relationship-building skills.
“We are not here to be the face of every diversity group. We are here though to help those voices finally get a platform,” Rahman said in an interview with The Hoya. “Our job is to get them a seat at the table.”
Nair is running for president with Rahman as vice president. They face satirical ticket Logan Arkema (COL ’20) and Jonathan Compo (COL ’20), Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) and Richard Howell (SFS’19), and Josh Sirois (SFS ’20) and Casey Doherty (COL ’20) in the Feb. 22 election.
Nair is director of external outreach at Innovo Consulting, a group that connects social entrepreneurs and nonprofit organizations to Georgetown students. He was born in India, but moved with his family to Kentucky when two years old, where he was the only person of color in his elementary school and the first student from his high school to attend Georgetown.
Rahman was the secretary general of the National Collegiate Security Conference, a model United Nations conference for college students, last semester and has been involved with the Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, a $1.5 million student-run fund that allocates grant money to student and alumni social ventures. A Mississippi native, Rahman said her experiences growing up shaped their campaign’s main promise.
“I am Muslim, Pakistani and I’m a woman, so for me I always found myself never really part of the group,” Rahman said.
The pair began discussing a potential ticket in mid-November over lunch in O’Donovan Hall. Rahman first approached Nair with the idea, according to him.
“It was something Naba was thinking about seriously first,” Nair said. “I then came back to her and said this is not only something I think you should just do but something we should do together.”
Nair and Rahman are running on a broad platform covering 30 policy areas. Their platform is built on three themes: inclusion, opportunity and accountability. Rahman said GUSA alienates most Georgetown students, which the pair seek to rectify by actively engaging more student clubs.
Nair emphasized the participatory nature of their platform. Many of their points emphasize dialogue, soliciting student input on issues and connecting students to relevant campus resources.
“Naba and I are running on the credo that every voice matters,” Nair said. “The way we want to organize this campaign and this administration is increasing the base-line quality of a Georgetown students experience here.”
In particular, the pair seek to prioritize mental and sexual health. Nair and Rahman said they plan to increase funding for the mental health stipend, which will provide off-campus mental health support for 10 to 20 students with demonstrated financial need, and offer private weekly STI screenings at the student health center.
Academic affairs are another priority for the ticket. Nair wants Georgetown to offer college minor programs to students in all undergraduate schools and to schedule more study days before final exams.
Their platform also includes increased funding for GUSA Fund — a discretionary budget that directs funds from the student activities fee — from $15,000 to $20,000. They also plan to direct the funds resources to three key areas: student wellness, innovation and diversity and inclusion.
Nair and Rahman emphasized the role they would play in facilitating other students’ ideas in addition to promoting their own priorities. Rahman said GUSA currently places the responsibility on students to seek out GUSA’s help.
“That should not be the case,” Rahman said. “The onus should not be on you as students, rather it should be on us as GUSA to reach out to you.”
The pair proposed community advisory groups in which student groups would get face-to-face time with the executive on a rotating basis. Rahman said this open-door policy would allow more students the chance to voice their opinions.
A potential weakness for the pair lies in their relatively limited GUSA experience and their lack of relationships with GUSA leadership and university administrators, as Nair and Rahman acknowledged. Rahman served on GUSA’s Federal and D.C. Relations committee, a part of the GUSA executive, for six months while Nair has no past GUSA experience.
“Sahil and I are not immune to the fact that we do not have the GUSA experience that some other people may,” Rahman said.
Nair said the pair would use their experience as leaders in other student organizations to develop relationships with administrators. He added he is an “ideas-driven person” and “an individual that enjoys building relationships and communicating.”
Their external experiences in other student organizations provides the pair with a perspective on where GUSA’s shortcomings are, Rahman said. “We’ve both seen what GUSA looks like from the outside, and we have seen the resources that are available but are not communicated out nor are connected to the student body.”
Another potential liability for the campaign is Rahman’s plan not to stay on campus for the summer. She has accepted a summer internship with Morgan Stanley in New York.
Per GUSA bylaws, the president must stay on campus for the duration of the summer. While there is no such requirement for vice presidents, vice presidential candidates Doherty and Howell have committed to staying in Washington, D.C., if elected. Rahman pledged to commute to D.C. on weekends.
“I’ll be going back and forth, it’s been done before, it can be done again,” Rahman said. “It is a bit foolish to think that just because the two executives are here in D.C., the entire GUSA administration is going to be running.”
After speaking with current GUSA President Kamar Mack (COL ’19), Nair said they plan to involve their policy heads as much as possible over the summer to prepare for the academic year.
Nair emphasized GUSA’s influence on campus, particularly as a tool for agenda-setting.
“When GUSA talks about an issue, it’s what this campus talks about, it’s what our publications write about and it’s what our administrations are going to be hearing about,” Nair said. “So being participatory and soliciting those ideas from students is exactly what GUSA should be doing.”

The global community must engage the voices of more women to promote peace and prosperity around the world, Alaa Murabit, a United Nations high-level commissioner on health employment and economic growth, said at a March 15 event.
“Less than 10 percent of peace processes last five years,” Murabit said. “But when women are included, they are 35 times more likely to last 15 years, that means an exponential opportunity for economic growth, political empowerment and regional stability — completely transforming the dynamic of the region.”
The event was cohosted by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and the Berkeley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, and cosponsored by the Georgetown University Women’s Center, the International Relations Club and the Muslim Students Association.
Originally from Saskatoon, Canada, Murabit moved to Zawia, Libya at the age of 15 to enroll in medical school. According to Murabit, the relegation of women to inferior roles after the Libyan revolution galvanized her to fight for women’s rights. In 2011, she formed The Voice of Libyan Women, an organization that focuses on women’s inclusion in peace processes and conflict resolution.
Murabit views women’s rights, particularly in the political sphere, as necessary for the continued advancement of society.
“I did not grow up as a women’s rights activist,” Murabit said. “I started identifying as a feminist after I began doing the work and saw that women’s inclusion was the only thing that would actually work in keeping our planet, our prosperity and our people alive to a significant degree.”
Through her work with The Voice of Libyan Women, Murabit said she recognized the positive effect that women can have on working on peace missions. At the March 15 event, she said women’s rights must be included in the state-building process to create a genuinely gender-equal society.
“If you don’t solidify women’s rights when you’re building the state, it’s not going to come in later, it’d be like trying to build a subway in an established city,” Murabit said. “So the idea for VLW was to ensure women’s inclusion was part and parcel of the nation-building and state-building process.”
VLW has since led a number of successful campaigns that have been replicated globally, which prompted Murabit to begin her current work on international security with the United Nations. According to Murabit, the answer to global population growth, an issue that Murabit views as one of the world’s greatest challenges, can be solved with women’s empowerment.
“The most cost-effective and practical solution to end climate change is population control, which is two things: women’s reproductive rights and girls’ education,” Murabit said.
Murabit also said that promoting global women’s education spurs economic growth.
“If we were to educate and employ girls and women equally, we would have greater economic growth than China and India combined,” Murabit said. “It’s the single greatest economic stimulus that exists in the world today.”
For Murabit, the way that a nation treats women can be an indicator of whether a country will thrive or fail.
“Empirically, the number one way that we can tell if a country is going to fall into conflict internally or regionally is a decline in the status and treatment of women,” Murabit said.
Murabit said politics will improve with engagement from more empowered women.
“I told my mom that I wanted to go to the moon, and she said, ‘Great, I’ll pack you a lunch.’ I was never told I couldn’t do anything, and gender was never brought up in my childhood,” Murabit said. “So when I saw the global policy data, I didn’t need to be convinced — it made the case for women’s rights for me.”

The annual OWN IT Summit, aimed at empowering and inspiring women personally and professionally, brought over 100 speakers to Georgetown’s campus this weekend to discuss the role of women in politics as well as sexual assault and harassment in the workplace.
This year’s summit aimed to address the #MeToo movement, a hashtag campaign that started in 2017 to share the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment for women in the workplace. The event focused on what the movement means for women entering the workplace and encouraging young women to participate in politics, according to OWN IT 2018 Director of Communications Amanda Shepherd (SFS ’18).
Created in 2014 by Helen Brosnan (COL ’16) and Kendall Ciesemier (COL ’15), the summit is designed to promote intersectional activism, female empowerment and leadership for young women on campus. The event’s founders created OWN IT to address the lack of female leadership in large businesses, according to the event’s information page.
The event featured three panel discussions and two breakout sessions, with each speaker sharing their experiences with gender discrimination, sexual misconduct and activism. Speakers included Maryland gubernatorial candidate Krish Vignarajah, CNN commentator and liberal activist Sally Kohn, press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign Symone Sanders, American gymnast Mattie Larson, poet Cleo Wade and journalist Amy Brittain.
Deborah Canty (CAS ’78), the first female president of the Georgetown University Student Association, opened the event with a message of motivation as she urged women to continue pursuing leadership positions. Canty said that despite the strength of the #MeToo movement, she hopes that it will continue to push for female empowerment to dismantle a white, male-dominated system.
“The unfortunate truth is that most power is still in the hands of white men, and women are still held to a double standard,” Canty said. “I hope your contributions and your efforts just like so many women before you will result in changing this.”
Canty said it is important that young women speak up and ignore those who might try to silence their voices.
“There are those in society who would like us, women, to be smaller, quieter, diminished,” Canty said. “My advice to you is to be as large as you wish to be.”
OWN IT was originally scheduled for Saturday, March 24. However, members of the organizing team said they decided to move the event to Sunday in a show of solidarity with the March for Our Lives, a student-led rally to protest gun violence in the United States.
Co-Chair of OWN IT Sarah Clements (COL ’18) addressed the summit’s solidarity with the March for Our Lives protest during her opening statement.
“We stand in solidarity with the students in Parkland, Fla., for reminding our generation and every generation of the urgency of this very moment to make change, break down barriers, find solutions and speak out even when it feels impossible,” Clements said. “These are OWN IT values too, and we hope to continue to build on the energy from yesterday’s events.”
Shepherd said that the speakers and vendors were both understanding and accommodating of the date change.
“It was really heartwarming to see how all of our speakers and vendors and all of that were really understanding of the change and really were on board and understood why we made that difficult decision,” Shepherd said.
Two awards were also presented at the summit. The Gwendolyn Mikell Award for Women’s Empowerment, a collaborative effort between the Georgetown Social Innovation and Public Service Fund, a student-run fund for social impact projects, and OWN IT, granted $500 to Rachel Mucha (SFS ’18) for her nonprofit work in India, while poet and author Cleo Wade received the OWN IT Summit Award, also known as the Trailblazer Award, for her powerful and inclusive poetry. Wade was the keynote speaker of the summit, and she discussed her new book “Heart Talk” with OWN IT co-founder Helen Brosnan.
Wade said that she intended her book to help her connect with her audience and overcome pain.
“I really wanted to write something, create something so that I could have a vehicle to get in the room with my audience to really realize the healing that we all needed,” Wade said.
Wade said she wrote her book as an inclusive tool for healing and strived to create a piece of art that would appeal to many different people.
“When I was writing the book, I really did think about it being this really foundational tool, and in that I wanted to make sure that there were a lot of different entry points for people’s healing,” she said.
Wade said that this quest for inclusivity reflects the way that women should try to lead: by empowering voices that are not often as celebrated to speak out.
“Women don’t lead so that their voices can be heard,” Wade said. “We lead so that the voices that aren’t being heard can be heard.”
OWN IT Co-Chair Sienna Mori (COL ’18) said that the OWN IT summit is a step in contributing to the effort to empower women, strengthen female voices and fight gender discrimination in society as a whole.
“The conversations that we have in this room will crack the glass ceiling just a little bit more and bring us just a little further in our fight for equity, access and inclusion,” Mori said.

For Rachel Mucha (SFS ’18), this year’s recipient of OWN IT’s Gwendolyn Mikell Award for Women’s Empowerment, the India Innovation Studio class was critical to sparking her passion for furthering the financial literacy and education of women.
The India Innovation Studio is a course through Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service in coordination with the government of Maharashtra, India. The goal of the course is for students to design and implement a solution to a development issue that India faces. Mucha received this year’s award for her project focusing on providing financial management and entrepreneurship training to female farmers in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra.
The award, a collaboration between the OWN IT Summit and Georgetown’s own Social and Innovation Public Service Fund, honors a woman for “pursuing a not-for-profit project that in some way relates to social innovation, public service and/or environmental sustainability,” according to the OWN IT website. SIPS, a student-run philanthropic organization that grants $60,000 each year to students conducting social projects, co-sponsors the award.
Mucha, who had been working with SIPS on the project before receiving the award, said she was encouraged to apply for the grant by her SIPS project manager to continue to expand her work.
In an interview with The Hoya, Mucha explained her vision behind the project that led to her receiving the award.
Your project focuses on providing financial management and training to female farmers in India. How did you first get involved with the farming industry?
I don’t have much experience with female farming, but I’m part of the India Initiative at Georgetown. So, I’ve been studying and working on projects related to India throughout the course of this year. In terms of financial literacy for women, as a culture and politics major, my focus has been on global level development solutions that can benefit women. So, microfinance and financial literacy are key to have.
Why did you decide to get involved with the India Initiative?
I started taking a class called the India Innovation Studio last semester, and our focus this year is on public health and sanitation. I didn’t really know a lot about India, but I was interested in applying the public health aspects of the class.
How do you plan to use your grant?
These $500 will allow me to stay an extra week and hopefully implement the workshop in another community. The initial plan was just to do it in one and make a town hall or community center, but hopefully now we can expand it. I’m also planning to design some sort of booklet or curriculum that I can print out and leave as a tool to refer back to.

Do you plan on going to India soon?
I am going in June for three weeks. I am going for a week with my class, two weeks by myself and, depending on what post-grad looks like, I might end up staying on to do some other things with the [India Innovation] Studio.
How do you plan on initiating everything there?
I’m working on a survey that I’m sending to the non-governmental organization I am partnered with. They will distribute the survey within the community so that it can better diagnose and understand where the gaps of financial literacy are for the people I’ll be working with, because they do not want to implement a curriculum that is unnecessary. I also made sure that I am cognizant that women have a lot of domestic or household responsibilities, so if family budgeting or financial managing would be more useful, then I will focus on those. When I get the results of the survey, I am designing a curriculum, and I have done a lot of research on different kinds of digital literacy curriculums. [The class] will be in the evening from eight to 10, after the work day ends.
Do you have an idea of what you think the curriculum might look like?
It depends on the survey results, but right now I am planning to talk a little bit more about digital financial literacy, like how to use online banking or mobile pay apps. I also might end up working on business management skills, like teaching women how to manage their finances from an entrepreneurial perspective, like revenue generation.
What message do you hope to instill in Georgetown students?
Take advantage of the resources on campus. There are a lot of opportunities for funding and travel. I think I am just a lucky beneficiary of the support networks I have, and I am really grateful for OWN IT and the SIPS fund for giving people like me the opportunity to take on projects that we’re interested in.

The Georgetown University Midwest Club, which hosted its inaugural social event March 27, providing s’mores to prospective members on Healy Lawn, aims to create a more inclusive club culture on campus by targeting students from the continental United States for its upcoming events.
Two of the club’s co-founders, Henry Gunderson (SFS ’20), a native of Des Moines, Iowa, and Eric Ren (SFS ’20), from Detroit, said they were excited for the future of the club as it works to provide an opportunity to foster a community at Georgetown not currently offered by other clubs on campus.
Currently, the Midwest Club is undergoing the “new club development” process, outlined by the Student Activities Commission, the advisory board that allocates funding to university-recognized student groups. Gunderson said the club’s interest meetings and its recent s’mores event play a role in the club’s status with SAC. All clubs must host a certain number of events per semester, and SAC members base part of next year’s budget allocation on the number of events the club is predicted to host. The club must also illustrate a sufficient amount of student interest for it to receive funding from SAC, according to Ren.
SAC rules mandate that the Midwest Club should hold three meetings with at least a third of the people who expressed interest. About 150 students have expressed interest in joining the Midwest Club, according to Ren.
The club awaits SAC’s decision on whether it will become an officially recognized Georgetown student group with allocated funding, according to Gunderson.
Gunderson said the primary reason for the club’s creation is to combat the noninclusive nature of bigger student groups on campus.
“So, it came in two parts. The first part is, we all really enjoy the Midwest,” Gunderson said. “And the other part, and this one sounds a little bit deeper, we were all on the same floor last year, and a lot of us joined different clubs. And there was not a lot of chance to connect, because all the clubs at Georgetown are awesome, like the Corp and GUAFSCU are awesome, but they’re very internal-facing. Once you join, that’s your crew. We wanted to create a club that was very external-facing, and was almost not a club in the sense that it brought people from all of the different spaces at Georgetown together, or gave the option to.”
Future events include a cornhole tournament, a movie showing and a barbeque on Healy Lawn, according to Gunderson. The club also plans to host bonfires and partner with other organizations, like the Georgetown Program Board.
Students who hail from states outside the Midwest are welcome to participate in the club’s events, Gunderson said.
“We want to do very external, community-facing events. That was part of the drive. All of us were on the same floor last year and some of us lost contact with each other because we’re all in different clubs, and in some ways, it’s creating a huge freshman floor, where we can come together and be part of a community and just get to know other people,” Gunderson said.
Ren echoed Gunderson’s views that the Midwest Club strives to be accessible for all students irrespective of their interests.
“Another good thing about having a club that’s external-facing is that there’s really no ‘culture’ with it that comes with the club,” Ren said. “You don’t have to be interested in a certain aspect. For example, if you’re in GUASFCU, you’re interested in finance or helping people manage their savings account. I think the Midwest Club is good for having an open environment, where you can be who you are.”
The co-founders said there would be no club membership dues, citing the importance of removing obstacles for Georgetown students to participate.
Gunderson said socio-economic inclusivity is integral to the club’s community-driven objectives.
“We decided we really didn’t want membership dues because we wanted anybody to be able to come,” Gunderson said. “And to be honest, a fair amount of people that come here from the Midwest are on scholarship, which is really interesting, at least for me.”
Ren added that a lack of membership fees would foster a stronger bond within the club.
“We really believe in high-quality, low-cost community events, and what really helps with that is just having members from different backgrounds able to pool our resources together to host stuff,” Ren said.

The fact this club exists is very triggering to me.  There are not a lot of people of color in the Midwest and this club appears very White male dominated, which tells me it is problematic and possibly evil.  
What is the club doing to take advantage of the vibrant diversity Georgetown’s students of color have to offer?

Have you been to the Midwest?  That is an unfortunately misinformed and arguably biased assumption.  Illinois has the 2nd largest percentage of Indian-Americans in the US (after NY). Michigan and Iowa are 1st and 3rd for Muslims in general (DC is 2nd).  And of course, the nation’s largest Native American populations, and many others are all from the Midwest.  Seek to understand rather than inflame, my friend, and hopefully then experience healing.  Peace and blessings.

The former Village C Terrace was dedicated this Monday to Fr. Martin J. O’Gara, S.J., a Georgetown faculty member who was killed while serving as a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force during World War II.
O’Gara’s name was previously given to O’Gara Hall, a dormitory, infirmary and office building that stood near the site of the Terrace. The building was torn down in 1984 to make room for Village C residence halls.
O’Gara served as part of the Air Transport Command, which oversaw and carried out transportation of supplies without engaging in conflict. He died in 1946 in a plane crash while flying from India to the United States to be discharged.
O’Gara’s plane caught fire south of the island of Capri, off the west coast of Italy. O’Gara gave up his parachute to a passenger and chose to stay on the plane to give his fellow servicemen time to escape. Eight passengers were saved before the plane crashed with O’Gara still on board, according to a Georgetown news release.
The memorial is particularly significant because there is currently only one veteran memorial on campus, Cristine Pedersen, president of the GU Veterans Association, said.
“There’s one memorial to post-9/11 veterans on campus, but now that the campus has grown, it’s in a really weird spot: a parking lot,” Pedersen said. “That’s why I thought it was really important.”
The push to rename the terrace was initiated roughly a year ago by Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (GRD ’86), a Republican from Nebraska, Pedersen said. Fortenberry serves on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Veteran Affairs.
Remarks were delivered at the dedication by Pedersen, Fortenberry, University President John J. DeGioia, University Vice President for Mission and Ministry Rev. Mark Bosco, S.J., and Rector of the Georgetown Jesuit Community Rev. Joseph Lingan, S.J.
In her speech, Pedersen said Georgetown students should reflect on more than just the political consequences of violent conflicts and appreciate the service of those like O’Gara and Capt. Andreas O’Keeffe (LAW ’06), who was killed on the border between Iraq and Syria on March 15.
“As we current Georgetown students rush from class to class, debating foreign policy and adequate responses to various conflicts around the world, we must continually and intentionally engage in discussions on the real human impact of these conflicts and honor the sacrifices of heroes such as Fr. O’Gara and Capt. O’Keeffe in not only formal events such as these but in our daily actions and work,” Pedersen said.
Fortenberry cautioned against progress without consideration of the past.
“Those of us in public office have a responsibility not to just look forward but to think about how we carry forward in time the great traditions and wisdom of the ages,” Fortenberry said. “And a lot of times we take for granted the formative institutions that give rise to right reason, to remembrance, to understanding, to concepts of nobility and sacrifice and dignity, because we’re caught in the tyranny of the urgency of the moment, always reflecting about what could be.”
Fortenberry also expressed hope that the terrace would be a more lasting memorial to O’Gara than O’Gara Hall was.
“I’m glad we have a terrace. That seems to be a little more permanent,” Fortenberry said. “It’s not going to get pushed down, perhaps, for progress. Because I think progress is truly found in the remembrance of those who sacrificed and gave their all.”

As a grandson of Fr O’Garas first cousin (Anne O’Gara of Ballisodare, Co.Sligo,Ireland ), I am very pleased to discover that the supreme sacrifice made by my ancestor has been recognized and celebrated in this way. I am proud of his dedication to God and country and of his mission to helping the sick and poor. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dhilís.

“What we’ve seen at Georgetown-Qatar is the norm erosion of our ethical standards.”
So wrote Ian Almond — a world literature professor at Georgetown University’s campus in Doha, Qatar, who is currently on leave — in a November 2017 letter sent to Provost Robert Groves concerning the treatment of migrant workers at the Qatari campus. Almond published the letter on his Facebook page in February after receiving no reply.
In his letter, Almond was incensed by what he viewed as the lamentable conditions for migrant workers at the Qatari campus. The 122 migrant workers who staff Georgetown’s Qatari campus work in a number of areas ranging from office management to facilities to dining. Yet according to Almond, these workers face deplorable conditions.
A few days after publicly posting his letter, Almond received a response from Groves, according to Almond’s Facebook page. Groves’ reply included a link to a February letter to the editor published in the Georgetown Voice discussing steps the university has taken to protect workers at its Qatari campus.
Almond, in his letter, claimed workers were paid between 1000 and 1700 riyals per month — the equivalent of $250 to $400 — and forced to sleep in cramped accommodations “with four or sometimes eight to a room.” The average wages of migrant construction workers in Qatar can be as low as $160 per month, according to Vox.
Almond said he found these conditions antithetical to the university’s values.
“This situation is intolerable,” Almond wrote in the letter. “It mocks and undermines everything we do and claim to be at Georgetown.”
Georgetown, which opened its Qatari campus in 2005, is one of six U.S. universities that have branches in a 14-square-kilometer community development in Doha known as “Education City.” The Education City initiative is supported by the Qatar Foundation, an organization for Qatari development founded and governed by the Qatari royal family.
Qatar has long been dogged by accusations of mistreatment and exploitation of its migrant workers, who are predominantly from Asian countries such as India, Nepal and the Philippines and make up 90 percent of the Qatari population, according to The New York Times. Such migrant workers are particularly vital as the country prepares to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup by building stadiums and developing infrastructure.
Workers involved in the World Cup construction reported having to pay recruitment fees, working excessive hours, having their passports confiscated and fearing reprisal for filing health and safety concerns, according to a 2017 report by Amnesty International.
Unlike workers at Georgetown’s Washington, D.C. locations, the university’s Qatari employees are not covered by the university’s Just Employment Policy, which requires the university to provide fair and competitive compensation packages to full-time employees and assures their right to a safe, harassment-free work environment.
Introduced in 2005 after student protests, including a nine-day hunger strike, the Just Employment Policy currently provides a minimum total compensation of $16.77 per hour.
Instead, migrant workers are held to the standards established by the Qatar Foundation in 2013, which stipulate all migrant workers employed by the foundation, its contractors and subcontracted firms must receive training on their rights under Qatari law in their own languages.
Workers are also legally protected from being charged recruitment fees to obtain work and from having their passports confiscated by employers, under these standards.
For migrant workers at its Qatari campus, Georgetown adheres to these mandatory standards of the Qatar Foundation and holds its contractors to these standards as well.
However, the Qatar Foundation’s mandatory standards are not always upheld for migrant workers in the country, according to Gulf researcher Kristina Bogos (GRD ’17).
“On paper, guidelines may look good,” Bogos said in an interview with The Hoya. “But in practice, it’s an entirely different story.”
Bogos attributes the lack of enforcement to the asymmetric power balance created by a sponsorship system known as kafala, which tethers the visas and residency permits of all guest workers in Qatar to their employers.
Under this system, sponsors maintain the power to “confiscate passports, withhold or delay the payment of … wages, among other forms of ill treatment, with virtual ease,” Bogos added.
Concerns about the treatment of migrant workers at Georgetown’s Qatari campus were raised in a January editorial in The Hoya, “Extend Rights to Qatar.” Since the article’s publication, the university has announced its commitment to the 122 migrant workers contracted at the Qatari campus and publicly disclosed the creation of a Qatar Foundation-Georgetown University Joint Task Force on Worker Welfare, formed in January 2017.
Since its inception last year, the task force has worked to develop recommendations, including a greater emphasis on migrant worker welfare plans, steps to combat unethical recruitment practices such as recruitment fees and easier mechanisms for filing grievances, according to a university spokesperson.
In a February letter to the editor in The Hoya responding to the editorial, Groves cited the creation of the task force as an example of strides the university is making toward improving conditions for migrant workers. He also highlighted the presence of two Georgetown employees in Qatar charged with vetting contractors’ worker welfare plans at the Qatari campus and overseeing their compliance with the mandatory standards.
“We understand Georgetown’s responsibility to promote migrant welfare in Qatar,” Groves wrote. “We care deeply about this work, recognize the challenges ahead and are committed to continuing to improve the conditions for migrant workers on our own campus and throughout the region.”
The university has also established a process to hear and address the grievances of employees at the Qatari campus. In the last year, 23 of the 26 complaints formally filed with the university were resolved in a timely fashion to the satisfaction of the employee, according to a university spokesperson.
The university administration in Qatar also commissioned a survey to collect information about workers’ conditions, employing professors, staff and students to help interview employees over a series of weeks. However, nearly two years after the project’s start, the results remain unpublished externally.
In one of several of his policy demands, Almond implored the provost to publish the “squashed” data from this survey, or at least make it available to “concerned faculty.”
Georgetown was “unable to release the results without compromising the confidentiality of the respondents,” according to a university spokesperson. However, the results were an important force behind the university’s establishment of the task force, according to a university spokesperson.
Alisha Kamran (SFS-Q ’18), a student at Georgetown’s Qatari campus who helped conduct the interviews, attributes delayed publication to standard research practice. Because the interviews were discussion-based, she said, it would take considerable time to break that qualitative research down into quantitative statistics.
Kamran is the program director of the Hoya Empowerment and Learning Program, a student-run literacy program at the Qatari campus that tutors migrant workers in topics like English and financial literacy. In her role at HELP, Kamran has established close relationships with several of the service providers.
While she takes issue with their long hours and confined living conditions, she said she is impressed by Georgetown’s dedication to its contracted employees.
Kamran said that through HELP’s biweekly classes, university-led food drives and a dinner held at the start of each year for students and service providers, workers are made to feel part of the Georgetown community.
“The providers aren’t segregated from students; they are made to feel part of the community,” Kamran said. “After speaking to a lot of them, they actually really like working here, because they are treated very well within the building. I’m sure that’s not the case for other workers in other areas in the country.”
However, Almond, who frequently participated in HELP’s programming, argued the projects are not enough.
“With the greatest respect, I’m not talking about free glasses/free t-shirts/literacy classes/Christmas raffles/free food,” Almond wrote. “I participate in and contribute to all of these things, the people who run them are wonderful – but they are not permanent responses to the situation.”
Almond called for more substantive reforms, starting with a “one-off cash payment” of $1,000 to each service worker and potentially culminating in a “complete restructuring” of the university’s service worker agreement.
Bogos, too, called for systematic changes, claiming Georgetown should at minimum implement long-term solutions to ensure the rights of the workers are not violated.
“Georgetown should think about its role more broadly in Qatar as an institution of higher education that supposedly espouses the ideals of social justice … and ensure that the standards it sets for its workers at the D.C. campus match those at the Qatar campus,” Bogos said. “From what I know after being on the ground in 2016 and meeting with many workers at GU-Q, the institution is falling quite short.”
Such restructuring would entail negotiations with the Qatar Foundation and, as the organization sponsors a number of U.S. universities in the region, could trigger new agreements at other institutions.
Kamran said she appreciates Almond’s outspokenness and compassion for service workers at Georgetown, though she wonders how feasible the implementation of a restructuring plan would be.
“It’s just so complex. I’m not sure to what extent Georgetown has bargaining power with the foundation,” Kamran said. “It’s one of the most powerful bodies in Qatar.”
Still, Kamran said the university’s academic focus on human rights is a step in the right direction.
“We have a lot of students who do a lot of work on migrant workers,” Kamran said. “You’ll always see, whether it’s freshmen students or seniors, every batch, there’s always some sort of effort being put into studying the issue.”
But Kamran concedes there is work that remains to be done.
“Georgetown is great with vocalizing opinions,” Kamran said. “But I think there needs to be more effort put into actually materializing ideas.”

Why does Georgetown have a campus in an authoritarian country that systematically exploits migrant workers and severely restricts religious freedom? Follow the bucks!

Will Maerov, a rising senior in the College at Georgetown University, died June 2 in a plane crash off the coast of Long Island, which also took the lives of his grandparents, Bernard and Bonnie Krupinski, and the pilot Jon Dollard.
Maerov was from East Hampton, N.Y., majoring in government with minors in art history and French. He was 22.
Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs at Georgetown, and Rev. Mark Bosco, vice president for mission and ministry at Georgetown, confirmed the death of Maerov and his grandparents in an email to the Georgetown community June 5.
“We are deeply saddened by this news and know that it is difficult for the many members of the Georgetown community who knew Will,” Olson and Bosco wrote. Bernard Krupinski, Maerov’s grandfather, was known as a “builder to the stars,” having once worked on houses for Billy Joel and Martha Stewart.
He was flying in a small private plane with his wife Bonnie Krupinski and Maerov out to the Hamptons when the plane crashed into the ocean amid thunderstorm conditions about a mile off shore from Indian Wells Beach in Amagansett, N.Y.
Bernard and Bonnie Krupinski were 70, and Dollard was 47. Local police divers recovered three of the victims’ bodies. Authorities suspended the search Wednesday afternoon without finding Maerov, according to local media reports.
The National Transportation Safety Board has opened an investigation into the cause of the crash. Terry Williams, a spokesperson for the NTSB, told The New York Times this week that a preliminary report would be released within the next week or two, but the final report on the cause of the crash may not be available until much later.
“We’re in the very, very early stages of this investigation,” Williams said.
Georgetown hosted a liturgy in Gaston Hall on the morning of June 3 to pray for Maerov and his grandparents, as well as for family and friends in mourning. Time during the mass on Sunday night in Dahlgren Chapel was also dedicated to the Maerov and the Krupinski families, according to Olson and Bosco.
Olson and Bosco encouraged members of the community to offer support to those affected by the loss of Maerov and the Krupinskis.
“Please join us in keeping Will’s family and friends in your thoughts and prayers during this sad and difficult time,” they wrote in the campuswide email. “We are in touch with Will’s family and are offering any support we can provide at this difficult time. We encourage students, faculty and staff to reach out to one another and be supportive of our community.”
The wake for Maerov occurred the afternoon of June 7; funeral services for the Krupinskis took place the following day in East Hampton.
Peers of Maerov at Georgetown remember him for his ability to connect with others.
“His overwhelming empathy lent to his open mind, lack of judgment towards others and amazing talent at listening. He invested time in truly getting to know people, not just meeting individuals at a surface level,” Alice Collins (COL ’19) said.
Aiden McAleer (Col ’19) echoed this sentiment when recalling his time at Georgetown with Maerov.
“Willie was an old soul, deeply concerned about the feelings and well-being of everyone he came in contact with,” McAleer said.
Maerov’s grandparents are remembered for their generosity and philanthropy for the East Hampton community.
Paul Rickenbach Jr., the mayor of East Hampton, wrote in an email to The Hoya that the Krupinskis never forgot where they came from and always gave back to their hometowns.
“Benny and Bonnie were givers: of time, money and compassion. I have heard countless stories over the last few days about their quiet generosity,” Rickenbach wrote. “Both were bright individuals and their contributions will be sorely missed. The legacy they leave behind is one that any individual should hope to have one day.”
Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York’s 1st District, which contains East Hampton, wrote in a statement that the Krupinkis absence will be felt greatly by the town of East Hampton.
“They will be dearly missed by their family, friends, employees and neighbors who adored them, their vision, love of flying, entrepreneurship and devotion to the East End of Long Island,” Zeldin wrote.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s China policy transforms the West’s historic attitude toward China, former Singaporean diplomat and professor at the National University of Singapore Kishore Mahbubani said at an event entitled “Has the West Lost It?” on Monday in Healy Hall’s Riggs Library.
During the event, Mahbubani discussed his new book “Has the West Lost It? A Provocation.” Victor Cha, the D.S. Song-KF endowed chair in international affairs, moderated the discussion. The Georgetown Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues and the Office of the President co-sponsored the event.
Mahbubani said the U.S.-China trade war that began last spring when Trump put tariffs on Chinese imports demonstrates a shift in U.S. policy towards China.
“The Trump administration is not trying to reach a deal,” he said. “It is trying to alter the playing field in a very fundamental way and that’s a different game.”
According to Mahbubani, the escalation of the trade war came as a surprise to Chinese leaders.
“It has come as a big shock to the Chinese leaders who have come to realize that what is happening now between the U.S. and China is something completely different,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani said that China is ready to work with the United States to end the current trade war.
“The Chinese are prepared to make a deal,” Mahbubani said. “This is the fundamental question: is [the trade war about] a trade deficit, which is one probability or is it about China developing technological capability which they will one day do better than the United States?”
Mahbubani said that an attitude of complacency at the end of the Cold War and the belief that Democracy had triumphed over Communism caused the West to overlook the rise of powers like China.
“The West [went] to sleep at precisely the moment when the rest of the world was waking up,” he said. “At precisely the moment that China and India were waking up.”
The West continued to neglect the growing power of China and its admission into the World Trade Organization in the wake of 9/11, according to Mahbubani
“The effect of 9/11 was that the United States and some European countries marched into wars in the Middle East and got engrossed in wars there and did not notice something more fundamental happening in 2001 which was China’s admission into WTO,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani said China’s admission to the WTO brought an influx of labor to the world market, causing many Western countries to see domestic jobs go over sea and creating the space for leaders like Donald trump to gain power.
“The reason why China’s admission in 2001 into the WTO was far more significant is because according to Western theories of economics, according to Joseph Schumpeter and creative destruction, when you suddenly inject 900,000,000 new workers into the global capitalist system there will be creative destruction so workers lost their jobs,” Mahbubani said. “And then you see fifteen years later the election of Donald Trump.”
Western countries ignored China’s surge to economic power in 2014, according to Mahbubani.
“In 2014, in one of a major historical moment, China’s share [of the global economy] became larger than that of the United States and nobody noticed that that happened,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani explained that he wrote his book to demonstrate that Western countries could lose their standing in global affairs if they do not actively protect the current liberal world order.
“Has the west lost it? And the answer is no. But more accurately, not yet,” Mahbubani said. “Because my big fear, and the reason why I wrote this book now, is that the west could very well lose it if it continues going on autopilot.”
According to Mahbubani, people throughout the world enjoy greater peace and prosperity than any other time in history.
“The biggest truth of our times is that humanity has never been in a better condition than it is today,” Muhbubani said. “Today we are living in the most peaceful time ever in human history.”
Mahbubani recommend that the West adopt a policy of multilateral intervention.
“I am asking for minimalist unilateral interventions and I am asking for maximalist multilateral interventions. So yes, intervene but do it multilaterally.”
In order to achieve this policy of multilateral intervention, the West will have to cooperate with countries with which it may not have otherwise allied, according to Mahbubani.
“You have to work with countries that you are uncomfortable with if you want to solve global problems,” Mahbubani said.
Mahbubani encouraged Asian countries to assume the responsibility of protecting the current world order because they benefitted the most from it.
“But today, the biggest beneficiaries of this Western created order, the liberal international rules-based order, are the Asian societies. So the Asian societies who have been in one way or another, I’m exaggerating a bit, have been free riders on this liberal international rules-based order have got to stop being free riders.”
Mahbubani said that Asian governments are reluctant to assume the burden of defending the liberal world order but that future Asian governments will have to take responsibility for protecting that world order.
“Unfortunately, no Asian government is, of now, ready and willing to take on the job of custodianship,” Mahbubani said. “The burden is going to fall on the young Asians to take on some the responsibilities that the West used to undertake.”

Indonesia has the potential to become a leader in the global Islamic community, University professor of Indonesian society and culture Bernard Adeney-Risakotta said at an event Oct. 2 in the Intercultural Center.
The discussion, hosted by the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, centered on religion and democracy in Indonesia. Adeney-Risakotta spoke about his new book, “Living in a Sacred Cosmos: Indonesia and the Future of Islam,” which was published in August and addresses the future of Islam in Indonesia. John Esposito, School of Foreign Service professor and founding director of the center, moderated the event.
Indonesia will likely influence Islamic discourse in the future because of the country’s emphasis on preserving Islamic tradition, Adeney-Risakotta said.
“As time goes by, Indonesia is going to have a greater and greater influence on Islam and on the rest of the world, because Indonesians — many Indonesians — are not ashamed of Indonesian Islam. If anything, they think it’s superior to Middle Eastern Islam,” Adeney-Risakotta said. “They do not think that Islam needs to be cleansed from all traditions and cultural expressions. They think that it needs to be preserved and strengthened.”
A rising tide of radicalism is reshaping Indonesian Islam, according to Adeney-Risakotta.
“There’s a lot of people who are very concerned about what is happening,” Adeney-Risakotta said. “There has been a rise, an increase in radicalism, increase in polarization, increase in certain kinds of oppression.”
Western intellectuals’ focus on the radical elements of Indonesian Islam obscure the more secular parts of Indonesian society, according to Adeney-Risakotta.
“I think most Western scholars and most Indonesianists, even Indonesian Indonesianists, very often focus on the rise of radicalism, the rise of intolerance, the rise of conservative Islam in Indonesia and the eclipse of what used to be called the Abangan, or the […] less observant Muslims in Indonesia,” Adeney-Risakotta said. “And I think the focus on that may be really hiding some things that are extremely important for us to pay attention to.”
Indonesia has historically welcomed and tolerated religious diversity because of its multireligious and multiethnic population, Adeney-Riskotta said.
“It was a crossroads for people from all over, and while Europeans powers fought with each other constantly, Indonesia depended on trade — being 17,000 islands, it depended on trade — and so it developed a long tradition of tolerance,” Adeney-Riskotta said.
Still, Indonesia remains culturally separate from what Adeney-Risakotta labels the world’s four “Axial civilizations” — China, India, the Middle East and the West — despite these civilizations’ influences on Indonesia’s history, according to Adeney-Risakotta.
“The four Axial civilizations that laid the foundation for the modern world are all deeply a part of Indonesia, but Indonesia has not become one with any of them,” Adeney-Risakotta said. “It’s not part of China, it’s not part of the Sinosphere, it’s not part of India, even though it was called the Dutch East Indies, it’s not part of Europe and it’s not part of the Middle East. It’s its own creation, which has, I think, something to offer to the rest of the world.”
Indonesians may struggle with their identity as the world and the country continue to develop, rapidly increasing average life expectancy and literacy rates, Adeney-Risakotta said, but he expressed optimism for the future of the country.
“I have a lot of hope for the future of Indonesia,” Adeney-Risakotta said. “There’s a lot of hope for the influence of Indonesia on the rest of the world.”

The number of children without health insurance in the United States rose for the first time in at least a decade, according to a report by the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy’s Center for Children and Families released Nov. 21.
The study estimated that the number of children without insurance in the United States rose by 276,000 in 2017, bringing the total number to 3.9 million. The number of uninsured children rose for the first time since 2008 last year, according to the report, which analyzes data the U.S. Census Bureau releases annually.
The report found that three-quarters of children who lost coverage live in states that did not expand Medicaid services available under the Affordable Care Act, a policy signed by former President Barack Obama in 2010 that expanded Medicaid eligibility and offered cost assistance for the uninsured through health insurance marketplaces.
The report found that the number of uninsured children rose in all 50 states because of loss in coverage or possible decreases in signups. Washington, D.C., saw the only increase in children with health insurance in 2017, after the number decreased in 2016. The percentage of children without health insurance in D.C. decreased from 3.1 percent to 1.2 percent. In a list of all 50 states and D.C., the city jumped from 13th to first in the number of children with insurance.
The discrepancy between the growing U.S. economy and the increase in number of uninsured children is concerning, said Olivia Pham, CCF research associate and co-author of the study.
“I think that it is really alarming, especially when we’re in a time when we have a strong economy,” Pham said. “Why are we seeing this increase in uninsured kids?”
The report suggests recent federal policy changes may have influenced the uptick in uninsured children. While the majority of children from low-income families are eligible for Medicaid or the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program, doubt regarding the programs’ futures may discourage enrollment, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in D.C.
Congress did not fully fund CHIP for over three months in 2017, prompting some states to freeze enrollment in the program.
Additional efforts in 2017 to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its individual mandate, which required almost all U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have health insurance, could have also affected the number of families with health insurance, the study says.
The report found one in four uninsured children has at least one parent with immigrant status. The rhetoric of President Donald Trump’s administration on immigration policy also may have contributed to fewer sign-ups, according to Pham.
In September, the White House proposed adding Medicaid to a list of public services that could prevent legal immigrants from receiving green cards if they had applied for public assistance.
“That kind of policy takes away the welcome mat from Medicaid and CHIP,” Pham said. “It has the potential to discourage families from applying for coverage and may give them fear about applying for Medicaid and CHIP when it could endanger other members of the family or their status.”
The report also documented a pattern of uninsured children in states with high percentages of Native American and Alaskan Native populations. Indian Health Services, a division within the Department of Health and Human Services, provides health programs to Native Americans in the continental United States and Alaska.
However, these populations still have high levels of uninsured children because the IHS does not provide insurance coverage, Pham said.
“The IHS is a provider of health services, but they are not a source of health coverage,” Pham said. “That is still important, because there are not IHS facilities everywhere, and kids can’t always access an IHS immediately when they need care.”
The study found Texas had the most uninsured children in the country in 2017, while South Dakota witnessed the largest increase in uninsured children from 2016 to 2017. Both states are among the 14 that have not authorized an expansion of Medicaid for low-income families.
In order to limit the increase of uninsured children, policy changes must be implemented, Pham said.
“I think the big concern with this report is that this upward trend in uninsured children continues,” Pham said. “If there are not changes in policy, if people don’t feel like it’s safe to access services, we’re going to see more and more children uninsured.”

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) selected Lewis Ferebee as the new chancellor for D.C. Public Schools at a press conference Dec. 3 amid a series of scandals that have dogged the school system in recent years and community concerns over Bowser’s decision-making process. 
Ferebee, who previously served as the superintendent of Indianapolis Public Schools, is set to replace former Chancellor Antwan Wilson, who resigned in February 2018 after circumventing the D.C. Public Schools lottery system to enroll his daughter at Woodrow Wilson Public High School. 
Ferebee will inherit numerous other scandals that the DCPS administration has faced over the last two years, including hundreds of thousands of dollars lost in miscollected tuition and accusations of falsified student attendance records. 
Bowser said she chose Ferebee because of his past experience leading a public education system and his commitment to serving community members.
“When I looked at Dr. Ferebee’s background and experience, I believe strongly that he matches what our community wants and needs most and is able to come and do great things with us and for students, families and educators,” Bowser said at the press conference. 
Since December 2013, Ferebee has served as the superintendent of IPS. At IPS, Ferebee helped create programs to increase opportunities for students to succeed in college and the workforce, including negotiating raises for teachers, according to a Dec. 3 DCPS news release.
The six-month search for the new chancellor was aided by the Our Schools Leadership Committee, which conducted a community engagement process to advise Bowser. The panel consisted of students, parents, teachers and community stakeholders and was responsible for providing community input on the search, according to the OSLC website. 
The majority of OSLC members, which also included members of the Washington Teachers Union, did not recommend Ferebee, instead supporting interim DCPS Chancellor Amanda Alexander, according to The Washington Times.
In August, a group of residents attempted to obtain a restraining order against Bowser because they worried she had not nominated enough members to the advisory committee and did not plan to listen to their recommendations. In September, Bowser added two students, two teachers and a parent to the panel but failed to provide their resumes to the panel, The Washington Times reported. 
Following Wilson’s dismissal, Alexander, former chief of elementary schools, served as the interim chancellor for DCPS, beginning in February, according to DCist. Alexander was the other front-runner for the position of chancellor, according to The Washington Post.
“It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as DCPS interim chancellor for the last 10 months. During this time, Mayor Bowser and DCPS have released new Pre-K to Graduation policies that are supportive, inclusive and equitable,” Alexander wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am confident that incoming Chancellor Ferebee will continue to build on the progress we have made, and I know that DCPS will continue to do great things for students and families.”
Ferebee is set to begin his role on Jan. 31, 2019, pending confirmation of his nomination by the D.C. Council early next year.
The Council Committee on Education plans to schedule public engagement sessions on Ferebee’s nomination in January because the upcoming end of the council period prevents the inclusion of additional meetings this month.
Since Ferebee comes from outside of the District, Chair of the Committee on Education David Grosso (I-At Large) encouraged public feedback in advance of the council’s vote. 
“In Mr. Ferebee, the mayor has chosen to nominate an individual from outside the District of Columbia. The vetting of such a candidate should not be taken lightly or hastily,” Grosso said in a press release Dec. 3. “As always, I encourage and welcome public feedback, comments, questions and concerns about the nomination as we prepare for a hearing on the nominee.” 
Wilson’s resignation was not the first scandal to have reached DCPS this year. Last month, the D.C. Office of Government Ethics found that a DCPS employee used his position to gain business for his own event planning company. In September, DCPS unintentionally posted the personal information of 2,000 homeless students on its website, where it kept the information up for seven months. In April, DCPS lost over $500,000 in tuition by failing to verify the residency of enrolled students. 
The scandals were not limited to this year, as in December 2017, one high school in DCPS graduated dozens of students who should not have been able to graduate after failing to meet certain attendance requirements.

Six Jesuit priests who were at one point associated with Georgetown University have been credibly accused of sexually abusing minors, as determined by the Maryland, Midwest and West provinces of the Society of Jesus in reports released this month.
None of the allegations specify incidents of abuse at Georgetown, although estimated periods of abuse overlap with on-campus assignments, according to the reports.
The Maryland Province’s Dec. 17 report lists priests who face credible accusations of sexual abuse — classified as allegations with “a preponderance of evidence that the allegation is more likely true than not” — as well as priests who were accused of committing abuse but were not investigated. The Maryland Province did not investigate the credibility of an allegation in cases involving the death of an alleged abuser or incomplete historical information, according to the report.
University President John J. DeGioia supported the disclosure by the Maryland Province and said Georgetown is dedicated to taking action against sexual abuse in a universitywide email Dec. 17.
“Our University is deeply committed to preventing and responding to sexual assault and misconduct and to protecting the most vulnerable among us,” DeGioia wrote. “Let us all take part in this responsibility.”
Fr. William J. Walsh, S.J., who was removed from public ministry in 1996, was implicated in multiple credible allegations of sexual abuse believed to have occurred from the 1950s to the 1980s, according to the Maryland Province report. Walsh worked at Georgetown from 1966 to 1967.
In 1996, five sisters reported to the Maryland Province that Walsh, their uncle, had sexually abused each of them 40 years earlier while they were in his care, according to an April 1998 CNN interview with one of the sisters and the sisters’ attorney. Walsh was called back to the United States from his teaching position in China and removed from ministry later that year.
He then worked at the Woodstock Theological Center, an independent Jesuit-run research institute housed at Georgetown that closed in 2013, from 1996 to 1998, according to the Maryland Province report.
The sisters made the allegations public in 1998 to call for Walsh’s dismissal from the clergy, according to the CNN interview. Following the public allegations, Walsh did not live in the on-campus Jesuit residence and had been placed on administrative leave, according to a 1998 university news release reported in the Georgetown Voice. The news release also said Walsh did not engage with students in his duties at Woodstock.
Fr. Michael Barber, S.J., who was removed from public ministry in 1994, pled guilty to harassment by inappropriate touching after the Maryland Province received an allegation against him, according to the report. The allegation was believed to have occurred in 1994. Barber served at the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital from 1976 to 1978.
Walsh and Barber are both still living. Jesuit priests with credible accusations of abuse live in supervised environments unassociated with any Jesuit institution and undergo risk reduction programs monitored by the province review board, according to the Maryland Province.
The Maryland Province reported that it received one allegation of sexual abuse against Fr. Martin Casey, S.J., estimated to have occurred in 1959. Casey lived in the Georgetown Jesuit community from 1973 to 1997 and worked at the university from 1997 until his death in 2006. The Maryland Province did not investigate the allegation for credibility but determined there was a “reasonable possibility” that the abuse occurred.
The Midwest Province released its own report the same day as the Maryland Province, naming 65 Jesuits with an “established” accusation of sexual abuse, an allegation with a “reasonable certainty” of truth. Two names mentioned in the report held connections to Georgetown: Fr. Thomas Gannon, S.J., and Bernard Knoth, who was removed from public ministry in 2003 and permanently dismissed from the clergy in 2009. Both have faced more than one accusation of sexual abuse, according to the report.
The Midwest Province detailed multiple allegations of sexual abuse against Gannon ranging from 1961 to 1998. These included a 1983 incident in Gary, Ind., just before Gannon moved to Woodstock, where he worked from 1983 to 1986. Gannon died in 2011.
Allegations of sexual abuse against Knoth initially surfaced in 2003 and range from 1986 to 1988, during his time as principal of Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis. He was assigned to Georgetown in 1990.
At Georgetown, Knoth served as a lecturer, chaplain-in-residence and associate dean of Georgetown College from 1990 to 1995. Knoth was also contacted in 2000 for the position of university president.
The West Province named Fr. Augustine Ferretti, S.J., who was assigned to Georgetown from 1944 to 1947, on a list of credibly accused priests released Dec. 7. The West Province reported that, in 2009, it received allegations of abuse against Ferretti that ranged from 1952 to 1976. Ferretti died in 1982.
The Maryland Province has affirmed its commitment to significant reforms for the protection of minors in light of the abuse crisis, according to Fr. Robert Hussey, S.J., provincial superior of the Maryland Province.
“We are deeply sorry for the harm we have caused to victims and their families,” Hussey wrote in the Dec. 17 news release. “We view the disclosure today of our shameful history as part of our commitment now to preventing abuse.”
Georgetown supports the transparency of the provinces in publishing the reports and encourages survivors of sexual abuse to access on-campus resources, according to a university spokesperson.
“Releasing this list of names is one step in acknowledging and addressing the terrible history of abuse, and there is much more work to do,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown is dedicated to preventing and responding to sexual assault and misconduct and encourages all members of our community to utilize available resources to report sexual misconduct or get support.”
The release of the lists comes amid a movement to revoke the honorary Georgetown degrees of former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who has been the subject of multiple allegations of sexual abuse, and Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who was named in an August Pennsylvania grand jury report for covering up abuse. The university has assembled a working group to examine the honorary degrees given to McCarrick and Wuerl but has not yet announced a decision.

The Office of Planning and Facilities Management is responding to a significant increase in student concerns about mold by cleaning dorms with high rates of moisture-related problems, as universities nationwide address mold infestation in campus buildings.
Between Dec. 21 and Jan. 9, facilities conducted cleanings and inspections of on-campus buildings that were exposed to high amounts of moisture and mold last semester, according to Benjamin Kuo, vice president of planning and facilities management.
“We conducted deep cleaning of all private bathrooms in our residence halls, on-campus apartments and off-campus townhouses, as well as larger communal bathrooms in the dormitories, approximately 920 bathrooms total,” Kuo wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
In addition, 148 bathrooms received extra cleaning to ensure that tile and grout areas were free of mold, according to Kuo.
Facilities responded to 361 mold-related work requests between August and October last year, more than double the number reported during that time frame in 2017.
All the bathrooms of Village A and Henle Village apartments were treated with Saniglaze, a sealing process to clean and maintain tile and grout, according to an email sent to the Georgetown community members Wednesday.
The university also hired outside contractors to inspect the dorms with increased reports of moisture and mold build-up, according to Kuo. Eastern Research Group, an industrial hygienist firm, searched for mold and measured air conditions in affected dorms.
Addressing reports of mold is a university priority and students are encouraged to contact the Student Health Center should they have any concerns about mold affecting their health, according to Geoffrey Chatas, Georgetown senior vice president and chief operating officer.
“We will continue to monitor the situation and respond to recommendations from ERG’s final report to ensure a safe learning, working and living environment for our campus community,” Chatas wrote in the Wednesday email.
Historic amounts of rainfall contributed to increased mold in on-campus dorms, with the greatest number of requests coming from students living in Village C, Darnall Hall and Village A.
Several students became ill after exposure to black mold in their dormitories last semester. Students reported contracting bronchitis, as well as experiencing difficulty breathing, coughing, lightheadedness, fatigue and congestion. Exposure to mold can lead to itchy eyes and skin, upper respiratory problems and nasal stuffiness, according to the Center for Disease Control.
Facilities conducted air quality assessments in Village C East, Village C West and Darnall Hall before winter break, according to a Dec. 3 email sent to residents of the three dorms. Facilities staff conducted visual inspections of each student dormitory room as well as the common rooms.
Members of the Georgetown Solidarity Committee urged the university to protect facilities workers responsible for the removal and cleanup of mold in a letter delivered to University President John J. DeGioia on Dec. 6. Workers were exposed to harsh chemical cleaners such as bleach during mold remediation efforts, often without proper training, according to GSC.
Other colleges in the Washington, D.C. area have also experienced issues with mold because of unprecedented amounts of rainfall and poorly maintained buildings.
Last September, more than 500 students at the University of Maryland, College Park, were relocated to hotels after mold was discovered throughout a freshman dorm. Incidents of mold in living areas have also been reported at nearby universities, including American University and The George Washington University.
The increase in reports of mold is not limited to colleges in the region: Indiana University at Bloomington is among many universities nationwide that experienced an increase in mold-related problems last semester, according to the Indiana Daily Student. IU is facing a class action lawsuit that alleges the university did not do enough to remove mold in two freshman dorms.

Andrew Yang, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, advocated for the introduction of guaranteed social security payments for all U.S. citizens over the age of 18 Tuesday. 
Yang’s main pillar in his campaign platform is his basic income plan, which would give every adult citizen $12,000 per year through a series of monthly payments. 
The government-sponsored payment program would help ease an economic burden on citizens, enabling them to tackle other pressing political issues, according to Yang.
“It would replace that mindset of scarcity with a mindset of relative abundance, and allow us to take on challenges like climate change in a more real way,” Yang said. “That is the great challenge of this era, to take the giant capital and market we are all subject to and rewrite the rules.”
Basic income plans have been experimentally implemented in multiple countries including India, where the state of Sikkim plans to establish a basic income for all citizens by 2022. In the United States, the guaranteed income proposal has previously received support from activists like Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who called it a tangible program for combating poverty in the past, according to The Atlantic.
Yang believes that an income floor, along with his plan to forgive a significant portion of student loan debt if elected, would enable more students to pursue careers and interests that they are passionate about.
“We need to make it so that you all can actually live out the ambitions you came to Georgetown with,” Yang said. “If we fail in that, then we have failed you, and we have failed everyone. Because what you do will actually be very very important in the future of this country over the years to come.”
Yang is the first Asian-American man to run for the Democratic nomination for president. He is the founder of Venture for America, a nonprofit that trains recent college graduates and young professionals in entrepreneurship by placing them in various startups across the country. Yang served as CEO of Manhattan Prep, a test preparation company, until 2011.
The event, titled “Entrepreneurship and Elections,” was hosted in Lohrfink Auditorium by the Georgetown University Lecture Fund. 
The need for an income floor has become more pressing in light of the rate of technological advancement and the automatization of jobs in manufacturing, retail, fast food and other industries, according to Yang.
“Unfortunately, what half of Americans do is called repetitive cognitive work or repetitive manual work, and those jobs are going to get automated away in very large numbers,” Yang said.
Automation would negatively affect 83 percent of jobs with a wage under $20, or 81 million jobs, according to a December 2016 White House report. Yang said the relationship between the increasing automatization of jobs and widespread job insecurity among U.S. citizens is the main reason President Donald Trump was elected into office in 2016.
While Trump’s popularity can be attributed to his emphasis on relevant problems in the U.S. economy, his proposed solutions are the opposite of what the country needs, according to Yang. Yang said Trump’s lack of tangible solutions to the problems facing the United States motivated him to run for president.
“[Trump] said we’re going to build a wall, we’re going to freeze time, we’re going to turn the clock backwards,” Yang said. “And I want to do the opposite of all those things. I want to accelerate our society and our government. I want us to see ourselves as having value independent of what the market says.”
Tuesday’s event was co-sponsored by the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation, Georgetown University College Democrats, the School of Foreign Service’s global business program and the Baker Center for Leadership and Governance. 
Through his presidential campaign Yang hopes to introduce new policies and ideas to revitalize the many outdated aspects of the American government and economy.
“We actually have to start trying to update the operating system of our government for this era,” Yang said. “We have to try and galvanize the American people, reclaim our democracy in a meaningful way and then make moves that we can agree on.”

Former Jesuit priest Bernard Knoth was a fondly remembered high school principal in Indianapolis, a beloved chaplain-in-residence and administrator at Georgetown University, and an esteemed university president at Loyola University New Orleans. Until a credible allegation of sexual abuse of a minor surfaced in 2003 from a former student at that Indianapolis high school, most who knew Knoth regarded him as affable and devoted.
Knoth, who was removed from the priesthood at his own request in 2009 after the first sexual abuse allegation against him was reported, made public and deemed credible by church authorities in 2003, worked at Georgetown from 1990 to 1995 as an assistant dean in the College, a professor of education and a chaplain-in-residence for freshman students in Darnall Hall.
In 2000, while serving as Loyola president, Knoth, now 70, was considered for the Georgetown presidency, Knoth said in a statement to Loyola’s student newspaper, The Maroon, at the time.
Georgetown has not publicly acknowledged Knoth’s connection to the university since the first allegation against him was made public in 2003. The university was not aware of the allegations against Knoth until the Midwest Province’s report 15 years later, a university spokesperson said in an email to The Hoya.
Knoth was first accused of sexual abuse of a minor in 2003, when a former student at Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis reported a 1986 incident of misconduct to the Chicago Province of the Society of Jesus, now the Midwest Province. Knoth was the school’s principal at the time of the alleged incident. The Chicago Province reported this allegation to the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office two days after Knoth’s 2003 resignation, according to a spokesperson for the Midwest Province. 
In 2004, a second allegation, deemed credible by the Midwest Province and made public in 2018, regarding an incident in which Knoth abused a minor in 1987, was reported to the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, which then reported the accusation to the Chicago Province, now the Midwest Province. The archdiocese also reported the allegation to civil authorities upon receiving it, an archdiocese spokesperson said. 
No criminal charges have been filed against Knoth, according to a spokesperson for the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office. 
In addition to working as a dean in Georgetown College, Knoth taught an interdisciplinary course called “Education in America” during the spring 1993 and spring 1994 semesters. He also lived in Darnall as a chaplain-in-residence from 1991 until 1994.
Knoth had a positive reputation at Georgetown after his five years at the university. When he left for Loyola in 1995, many were sad to see him go, including Richard Engel (GSB ’95), who lived on Knoth’s floor his freshman year.
“He’s the ideal Jesuit as far as dealing with the students go,” Engel said in a 1995 interview with The Hoya. “He’s well-rounded; he’s not just a teacher or administrator.”
Now, nearly 25 years later, Engel expressed surprise at the allegations and disappointment in his former mentor.
“There was nothing that raised any kind of suspicions or red flags of any sort whatsoever,” Engel said in a phone interview with The Hoya this week. “He was genuinely a nice person to talk to and didn’t make you feel that anything was out of sort.”
Though the Midwest Province has received multiple allegations against Knoth, neither the province nor the Indianapolis archdiocese has disclosed any information about the number of people who reported allegations, their identities or the nature of the alleged abuse.
Knoth requested a leave of absence from the Jesuits immediately after the 2003 allegation was deemed credible; he asked to be dismissed from the priesthood in 2009, according to the Midwest Province. The province did not comment on any disciplinary processes that took place internally during this six-year period. 
Knoth’s status as a layperson was first made public in October 2018, when he was named on a list of clergy credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor released by the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. By policy, the Midwest Province does not ordinarily disclose when a Jesuit is laicized, a provincial spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Midwest Province is not in contact with or monitoring Knoth, according to the provincial spokesperson. Knoth did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
In 2007, Barbara Blaine, then-president of advocacy group Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, noted the danger in leaving Knoth unmonitored.
“For the Jesuits to allow a known child molester to live without any kind of monitoring or treatment sets up children for abuse,” Blaine said in an interview with the Chicago Sun archived by Bishop Accountability, a website dedicated to aggregating all priests accused of abuse.
Knoth was removed from active ministry in October 2003, which stripped him of the ability to perform Mass, pursuant to church procedures adopted by U.S. bishops of the Roman Catholic Church in 2002, according to The New York Times.
Per Loyola’s bylaws at the time, which required the president to be a Jesuit in good standing, Knoth had no choice but to resign Oct. 7, 2003. He denied any inappropriate conduct in a personal statement to the Loyola community that day.
Knoth received an outpouring of support from the Loyola community in the wake of his resignation, according to the Times-Picayune, a local New Orleans newspaper. University leadership, including Fr. William J. Byron, S.J., acting president in Knoth’s absence, called on the community to pray for Knoth, as well as for survivors of sexual abuse. 
“I have deep, deep sympathy for this good man who has been accused, and I have deep sympathy for any victim of sexual abuse,” Byron said at a press conference after Knoth’s resignation. 
Students, faculty and clergy on campus used prayer vigils and submissions to The Maroon to express their sorrow, disbelief and even anger, convinced Knoth had been falsely accused.
“I believe that rather than focusing on what may or may not have happened in 1986, we should focus on what a good man Father Bernard Knoth was for Loyola University,” Kathleen Goodrich, then a junior at Loyola, wrote in an op-ed in The Maroon. “He committed himself completely to the betterment of the student body, and his presence as a leader and a friend will be sorely missed.”
An affable personality can make abusive priests hard to spot, according to Garnett Bedenbaugh, the New Orleans leader of SNAP.
“The exterior that they’re displaying may have nothing to do with their undercover activities,” Bedenbaugh said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “They can be well-liked by people; that doesn’t mean it’s not a credible charge against them. It’s which face you want to put on.”

Fr. Augustine J. Ferretti, S.J., began his career as a Jesuit priest at Georgetown University, enrolling in a graduate program during World War II. Though accusations of abuse would not emerge until six decades after he left Georgetown, Ferretti would eventually become one of the church’s most serial abusers, with dozens of accusations spanning decades.
Ferretti, who was ordained in 1941 and died in 1982, did not ultimately complete his planned doctorate in philosophy, according to graduate student and alumni directories. Ferretti was at Georgetown from 1944 until 1947, according to Jesuit records.
University President John J. DeGioia first acknowledged Ferretti’s time at Georgetown in a December 2018 email, three years after church authorities in Helena, Mont., named Ferretti in a report on abusive priests. Georgetown first learned of the abuse in 2018 from the Maryland Province, according to a university spokesperson.
Allegations against Ferretti were first publicly reported in 2009 in a lawsuit against the Oregon Province of the Jesuits, which oversaw Ferretti while he was assigned to a Native American reservation during the 1970s in Lapwai, a small town outside Lewiston, Idaho.
Dorothea Skalicky, one of the women who first brought the suit against Ferretti, said she was first abused in 1973, when she was 6 or 7 years old.
“Ferretti lured Dorothea to the church premises, under the pretense of inviting her to ‘play’ at the church, for the purpose of sexually abusing Dorothea,” the suit said.
The suit was later combined with several similar cases into a monthslong lawsuit that invited all survivors of clerical abuse in the Oregon Province to come forward within a period of six months. The combined case ultimately resulted in one of the largest settlements in church history, with more than $166 million paid to over 500 victims of sexual abuse, most of whom were Native American. Because the case was resolved in a bankruptcy court, the province did not have to release internal documents associated with any abusive priests or survivors.
The church is ultimately responsible for the duration of Ferretti’s abuse, according to Skalicky.
“This may not have even happened if they would’ve done something instead of just, ‘Okay, let’s kick him out of here because he did this and then put him here,’” Skalicky said in an interview with The Hoya. “So that is very frustrating.”
Ferretti would abuse children numerous times a week, according to lawyer Leander James, who represented survivors of Ferretti’s abuse in the later suit.
“It’s kind of like having a lion in the zoo,” James said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “And you let a bunch of children in the zoo, and then open the lion’s door and let him walk around the zoo. Well, kids are going to get killed, eaten, because that’s what the lion does.”
Mia Sonneck, who alleged in a 2008 lawsuit that Ferretti abused her while he was counselling her parents in 1973 and around the time he baptized her in 1974, referred to him as a “child predator of the worst kind.”
When the Jesuit order began an effort to expand into Native American communities, it attracted many priests interested in drawing closer to vulnerable children with few adults, according to John Allison, an attorney involved in the bankruptcy case.
“They tended to assign priests who wanted to go to these far-off places for bad reasons and it was a real confluence of bad choices that put the Native American children who were among some of these priests directly in the crosshairs,” Allison said in a phone interview with The Hoya.
Using a government program that granted Jesuits authority to distribute food vouchers on Native American reservations, Ferretti leveraged his power over children and their families, including one of James’ clients, the attorney said.
“He used quid pro quo at times to facilitate his abuse,” James said. “She was able to have access to food vouchers only if she did him sexual acts.”
Many of the survivors in the bankruptcy settlement, which ultimately named 64 priests, had been abused by Ferretti, according to Allison.
“Unfortunately there were also a number of serial pedophiles who were responsible for a good number of those claims, and Father Ferretti was one of them,” Allison said.
The allegations of abuse against a minors disclosed by the Jesuits’ Western province do not overlap with his time at Georgetown. The organization lists his periods of abuse against a minor as 1952 to 1958, 1960 to 1969 and 1971 to 1976. It does not disclose any abuse against individuals over the age of 17.
Because Ferretti’s period of abuse began several decades before the settlement, many survivors of his abuse were not accounted for, Allison said. This meant that many victims were deceased and unable to include their record in the bankruptcy suit that included 34 accusers, according to the Spokesman-Review, a local paper in Spokane, Wash.
The bankruptcy case, which involved a significant number of Native American victims, exemplified the pattern that perpetrators often target the most vulnerable, according to Timothy Walton, an attorney who represented survivors of Ferretti’s abuse in the combined case.
“The children who have very little in terms of a support group around them and who are always looking for attention from adults because of it — those are the ones the perps go for,” Walton said in an interview with The Hoya.
The survivors of Ferretti’s abuse displayed a telling similarity in their accounts, according to Walton.
“What was interesting is the modus operandi described by the children in Montana was virtually identical to the modus operandi described by the children in Lewiston,” Walton said. “And they didn’t know each other.”
The power of the priesthood and the vulnerability of Native American children were critical to Ferretti’s pattern of abuse, according to James.
“It’s a sociopathic victimization of children to dominate, control and have power over them,” James said. “And he used the religious medium as his access to kids — not only his access, but in the sense of his elevated status given to him by the church, particularly on a Indian reservation, to sexually dominate and control children.”

Comedian and political commentator Hasan Minhaj reflected on the role of identity in his comedy and called for the inclusion of diverse perspectives in the media industry March 28.
Both of Minhaj’s parents immigrated to the United States from India and raised Minhaj in the Muslim tradition. In his first stand-up comedy special, “Homecoming King,” which was released in 2017, Minhaj focused on his immigrant family upbringing and experience with racism around his Indian Muslim identity.
Minhaj said his identities as a Muslim and a first-generation American encourage him to define himself on inclusive terms.
“I’ve never defined myself being Indian and being like that means, ‘I’m not Pakistani, I’m not Sri Lankan,’ I’ve never defined it that way,” Minhaj said at the event. “India has dozens of languages and hundreds of different ethnic groups and identities. I’ve tried to define it by inclusive principles, not exclusive principles.”
Held in Gaston Hall, the event was hosted by the South Asian Society and co-sponsored by 14 other campus groups and offices, including Lecture Fund and the Muslim Student Association. The event featured a discussion between Minhaj, SAS President Vishal Menon (MSB ’19) and former SAS Presidents Vinoda Basnayake (MSB ’03) and Bhavya Jha (SFS ’17) and was followed by questions from the audience.
Minhaj hosts a weekly news-comedy show, “Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,” which premiered on Netflix last October, making Minhaj the first Indian-American host of a weekly comedy show. The show has covered topics including the 2019 Indian general election and political censorship in China. He has also commented on the death of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in fall 2018, in an episode the Saudi Arabian government demanded Netflix remove.
Minhaj also previously served as a senior correspondent for “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” and was the featured comedian at the 2017 White House Correspondents’ Dinner.
Leading roles held by members of minority communities increased 13.6 percent from the 2011-2012 to the 2015-2016 seasons, according to the 2018 Hollywood Diversity Report from the University of California, Los Angeles. The increase in diversity has been significant not only on the screen, but also during the production process, according to Minhaj.
“Over the last five or six years there has been a big push for inclusion and diversity in the writers’ rooms and in casting in shows, which I think has been a big win for everybody. I’ve seen that shift, and that has been really great,” Minhaj said. “A lot of time people think that inclusion and diversity is just in front of the camera, but there has been a lot of behind-the-camera stuff, in terms of the creation of the ideas producing the projects and all that stuff; that is a big deal.”
Universities and other communities should uplift diverse performers and empower new voices to share their perspective and humor, according to Minhaj.
“I think the good thing, and I think the thing that Georgetown and a lot of schools can tap into, is just give that stage to a diversity of voices,” Minhaj said. “Whether it’s South Asian female voices, whether it’s queer voices, let those performers perform.”
The “Patriot Act” news team and writers seek to amplify underreported stories that shed a light on little-known but nonetheless important issues, according to Minhaj. 
“The two biggest things that I try to look for on story are number one: hooking a story that makes people go, ‘Oh my God. How did I not know that? How was I just kind of walking around in my day to day life not knowing that?’ Or two: it’s a story that makes people go, ‘Oh my God. thank you for saying that,’” Minhaj said. 
Minhaj has been outspoken about college admissions practices on his Netflix show, criticizing a lawsuit by Asian-Americans suing Harvard University over the university’s admissions policy. In the show’s premiere episode, Minhaj accused the plaintiffs of potentially jeopardizing affirmative action with their suit, which alleges the university discriminates against Asian-Americans in its admission process.
In an interview with The Hoya before his event, Minaj commented on his views on the recent admissions scandal affecting Georgetown.
A March 12 Department of Justice indictment alleged that former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst accepted bribes from parents in an admissions scheme involving seven other universities. Ernst falsely designated at least 12 applicants as recruits for the Georgetown tennis team, according to the indictment.
The admissions cases should start a dialogue around the value universities place on legacy admission, according to Minhaj. 
“I think it has opened up a conversation around legacy admissions and I think that that is a big topic, especially because we are talking about meritocracy and everyone having an even playing field when they are applying to go to school,” Minhaj said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Minhaj said the DOJ allegations of admissions fraud at Georgetown and other elite universities did not shock him.
“I wasn’t surprised at all,” Minhaj said in an interview with The Hoya. “I think we saw a lot of these stories coming out from the sports world before, and now that something so public is happening in academia I think, you know, I was disappointed to hear about it but I wasn’t surprised.”

Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) urged indigenous women to advocate for the issues affecting their communities in political dialogue Tuesday.
The experiences of indigenous women give them a greater capacity to respect cultural pluralism and multilingualism, according to Haaland, one of the first two Native American women to serve in the U.S. Congress.
“I feel that what I bring to the table is my perspective as an indigenous woman. I know how to respect cultures. I know how to respect traditions. I know how to be respectful when somebody is speaking their indigenous language,” Haaland said. “I know the United States has a trust responsibility to Indian tribes, and that goes for all Indian tribes.”
Haaland, who took office earlier in 2019, became the first Native American woman to ever preside over the U.S. House of Representatives this month.
Addressing her role as a female legislator, Haaland said that although women have to work harder to gain recognition in the U.S. government, they should use that platform to boost issues that their constituents care about. 
“We just have to be ourselves and push forward and say we’re here because we care about the people we are representing,” Haaland said. “We’re here because we want our ideas and our issues to be at the forefront, and that’s really why anyone should want to serve the public, because they care deeply about the constituency.”
Haaland participated in an event titled “Intersectional Feminism in Congress,” hosted by the women’s and gender studies program in the Reiss Science Building. The event was moderated by You-Me Park, director of the WGST program, and featured a conversation between Haaland and Donna Brazile, a WGST adjunct assistant professor and former chair of the Democratic National Committee.
Minority representatives should not be intimidated about advocating for issues that directly affect their communities, Haaland said.
“It’s all about getting involved, it’s all about making sure that you are advocating for the right things,” Haaland said. “Because quite frankly, there are a lot of folks in Congress who don’t know or understand even what tribes are, or what that relationship is, or what they should be doing.”
The barriers faced by minority representatives such as Haaland can only be dismantled once young American voters show the willingness to take political initiative, according to Brazile.
“We can make it possible that one day we wake up and we’re not counting two Native American women. And we’re not counting a handful of African-Americans, and a handful of Hispanics and a handful of openly gay candidates,” Brazile said. “Your generation, the largest generation of voters, you can make that happen. And why you? I tell it to my students, you know, because there’s no one better. And why now? Because tomorrow is not soon enough.”
Haaland is particularly concerned about addressing some of the issues faced by Native American communities, such as the high occurrence of disappearances and murders of indigenous women. Native women on tribal lands face a murder rate 10 times higher than the national average, according to a 2016 Department of Justice report.
Improvements must be made to law enforcement structures in native communities, according to Haaland.
“So much needs to be done,” Haaland said. “If tribal police are the only ones on the scene for miles and miles and miles, they need to know how to handle evidence. The FBI needs to have a unit in their organization that deals more with this issue, because it’s in epidemic proportions.”
This article was updated March 29 to correct the nature of the WGST program.

Rangila marks its 25th anniversary this year and will use the showcase to pay homage to the individuals who shaped it over the years while introducing new elements like live music. 
Rangila, Georgetown University’s annual, student-run philanthropic showcase of South Asian dance, includes an average of 500 dancers, 1,500 audience members and $30,000 raised for India-based charities per showcase. 
This year’s 25th anniversary show, set for Nov. 22 to 23 in Gaston Hall, is themed “Make Your Mark.” This theme aims to celebrate Rangila’s past while simultaneously keeping the show rooted in the present, according to Rangila co-coordinator Anshul Agrawal (COL ’20). 
“We’re really trying to highlight the individuals that have shaped Rangila over the past 25 years as well as the individuals that are shaping it in its 25th year,” Agrawal said. “I think ‘Make Your Mark’ is the perfect amalgamation of that.”
While the show primarily features South Asian music, many of the choreographers also incorporate pop, rap and Latin music into their dances. Agrawal’s past dances have included genres ranging from traditional South Asian music to newer Bollywood tracks and rap songs like Kendrick Lamar’s “DNA.” Such variety helps show the dynamism of South Asian culture, according to Agrawal. 
“What Rangila strives to celebrate is how universal South Asian music and dance can be,” Agrawal said. “With most shows of this nature it’s either totally South Asian or it’s not very cultural at all, and I think Rangila brings a good mix because ultimately it’s a fusion showcase.”
This year Rangila will broaden its celebration of South Asian culture with its first in-house band, Saaz, composed of instrumentalists and vocalists from the Georgetown community that will perform their own original compositions inspired by South Asian music, according to Agrawal. 
This new element will expand Rangila’s cultural showcase to highlight areas beyond the choreographed aspect of the show, according to Raas dance co-choreographer Anika Sanghvi (SFS ’22). 
“Introducing a band makes it not as much dance-focused and more just about South Asian culture, and it broadens the scope of what Rangila is,” Sanghvi said in an interview with The Hoya. 
A key but often forgotten aspect of Rangila is its philanthropy, according to Sanghvi. Each year the Rangila philanthropic board selects an India-based charity to which they donate the show’s proceeds. 
This year, the money raised from Rangila will go toward Behala Anwesha The Quest, a nonprofit organization based in Kolkata, India, that supports children with disabilities through music and dance therapies, according to their website. 
Anwesha’s mission of helping children with disabilities develop their confidence aligns closely with Rangila’s own, according to Agrawal. 
“Their mission was something that we were really excited about because we also seek to empower people through music and dance,” Agrawal said. 
Rangila’s collaboration with Anwesha is particularly important given that mental and physical disability is rarely discussed in South Asian or American communities, according to Agrawal. 
“Issues of disability and the privilege that comes with being able-bodied is not something that we talk about too often,” he said. “So I was very excited for the Rangila community to engage with that issue this year by supporting Anwesha.”
Last year, the $30,000 raised from Rangila went to Prerana Anti-Human Trafficking, a nonprofit institution working toward ending the cycle of sex trafficking in India. Rangila has also partnered with Lend-A-Hand India, a nonprofit venture that provides vocational training to youth in rural and urban communities, and The Next Purpose, a nonprofit group that establishes sustainable medical and educational projects in underserved communities in India, in previous years.  
Through dance, music and philanthropy, Rangila has fostered an important cultural community on Georgetown’s campus for the past 25 years, especially among South Asian students, according to the Bulldog Bhangra dance choreographer, Syona Hariharan (SFS ’22). 
“It’s definitely given me a much better sense of community and family,” Hariharan said.
Rangila has also provided an important opportunity for South Asian students to share their culture and feel represented and appreciated on Georgetown’s predominantly white campus, according to Hariharan. 
“It’s nice to feel like people are interested in my culture and have such a positive attitude toward it,” Hariharan said. 
Agrawal is looking forward to shouldering the responsibility of coordinating this year’s cultural showcase despite the 25th anniversary’s added significance, he said. 
“Regardless of whatever year it was — whether it was the 24th or 100th—I’d feel the same amount of pressure simply because Rangila is such a huge event with so many people involved,”  Agrawal said. “It’s a whole lot of talent, it’s a whole lot of dedication, and it’s a whole lot of enthusiasm for the culture.”

Over 100 students and campus groups released a statement condemning an event planned to feature Indian right-wing activist Sunil Ambekar and demanding transparency from the university following the event’s cancellation.
Ambekar canceled his appearance at the India Initiative event, “RSS: Roadmaps for India’s Twenty-First Century,” on Sept. 17, according to Associate Vice President for Strategic Communications Meghan Dubyak. Ambekar was initially invited by a faculty member to address students enrolled in the class “India Innovation Studio,” and the event was RSVP-only.
When the event was canceled, the change was not formally announced; the student statement notes the event’s web page disappeared Sept. 15. Given the lack of clarity, students released the anti-Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad statement denouncing the speaker’s agenda and his affiliation with ABVP on Sept. 16.
Ambekar is the national organizing secretary of the ABVP, a right-wing, Hindu-nationalist Indian student organization with more than three million members. ABVP is affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a larger paramilitary volunteer organization widely regarded as the parent organization of the ruling political party of India, the right-leaning Bharatiya Janata Party. 
Both the ABVP and the RSS have been accused of fostering violence and intolerance against non-Hindu Indians, particularly Muslims, through their preaching of Hindutva, which refers to “Hindu-ness” and the ideology of Hindu nationalism. 
Groups including the Asian-Pacific Islander Leadership Forum and Georgetown University Student Association signed the statement, which argued that Georgetown should not provide Ambekar a platform to speak to students. The statement cited examples of violence committed and encouraged by the ABVP, including multiple accusations of assault against students and teachers at Delhi University in 2017.
“By bringing Ambekar to campus and promoting the ABVP’s viewpoint to students, Georgetown stands in direct contrast to its moral backbone and Jesuit values by normalizing a group that has a violent history of abusing minorities in India,” the statement reads. “This event should not be taking place and we cannot, in good conscience, allow it to happen.”
The India Initiative, a program in the Office of the Vice President for Global Engagement that works to promote dialogue about India’s role in world affairs, organized Ambekar’s visit. The initiative promoted the event as a conversation about his upcoming book on the RSS and its vision for India — including the role of other faiths in India, Hindutva and caste politics, and LGBTQ rights. The “Indian Innovation Studio” course is taught by Irfan Nooruddin, the director of the India Initiative, and Mark Giordano, a professor of geography.
The event description, however, does not accurately reflect the values that Ambekar and the ABVP stand for, according to Sonali Mirpuri (COL ’20), who drafted the statement with the South Asian Working Group of APILF at Georgetown.
“The event as it was marketed says that he’s going to come to promote his new book,” Mirpuri said. “Simply Googling his name, so many things come up about crimes against humanity, crimes against college campuses, and it just confuses me why Georgetown would sponsor such a figure to come to campus.”
On Sept. 17 Ambekar chose to cancel his visit to Georgetown, according to Dubyak. Ambekar’s invitation to speak was in line with the university’s policy of allowing free speech even if a speaker’s views are highly controversial, according to Dubyak.
“Georgetown does not prohibit speech based on the person presenting ideas or the content of those ideas, even when those ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable,” Dubyak wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
Though the event was initially available on the India Initiative’s website, the statement claims that the event page was silently taken down Sept. 15 and no information on the event could be found. However, some students were told by staff members that the event was still occurring, but closed to the public, according to the statement protesting Ambekar’s visit. The visit ultimately did not occur. 
The university needs to be clearer with students about what events are held and the purpose of these events, according to Mirpuri. 
“I feel like the event was put on with very little transparency in terms of like no one knew it was happening, it was a very under-the-radar thing,” Mirpuri said. 
Events like Ambekar’s uplift racist and Islamophobic voices rather than highlighting minority perspectives in India, according to Jamal Jaffer (COL ’21), the academic chair for South Asian Society.  
“There should be a reexamination on our position on India and relations with India,” Jaffer said. “We’re highlighting a lot of voices that are quite Islamophobic in the India space and in the political space, and we’re not really supporting a lot of the minority interests involved in these politics.”
Both Dharmic Life and Hindu Students Association released statements to their members addressing Ambekar’s event. The organizations condemned violence while acknowledging the right to free speech and debate.  
In the wake of this controversy, students should take advantage of campus resources to learn more about India’s culture and politics, according to Hindu Student Association President Darshil Shah (MSB ’20)
“As a Georgetown student myself, I encourage others who are interested in the topics of Hinduism vs Hindu nationalism to read more about it and have meaningful conversations about the two and challenge the beliefs and arguments offered by both,” Shah wrote in an email. 
Though the event was not highly publicized and was ultimately canceled, the fact that few students understood the event’s implications or even knew who the speaker was shows a pressing need for greater university recognition and discussion of non-Western issues, according to Mirpuri.
“Our lack of knowledge and our ignorance as an institution in promoting non-Western values has clearly shown through this event,” Mirpuri said. “It’s important to know about these things because we essentially, by having this event, would prop up someone in another country that has not just university effects, but long-term international effects.”

Hi;
I graduated from the SFS only a few months ago and with full disclosure, I worked very closely on the board of the India Initiative. The Hoya prides itself in unbiased journalism, but I’m disappointed to see the views of every other concerned party reflected except anyone from the India Initiative. It is the job of Georgetown’s most widely read newspaper to give an active voice to both the professors, and the students involved. Articles such as this will create bifurcations within the student body, and allow one side to leverage the privilege of coverage. 
As someone passionate about justice and strongly against organizations such as ABVP, I can assure you that the intent of the India Initiative was not to spread Hindu nationalism. 
Please reach out to students WITHIN the India Initiative and professors involved, so we can get a more holistic picture.  Either way – this article in its existing structure is problematic for how it  claims the the Initiative partakes in spreading Hindu nationalism. 
Journalism, especially in a place like Georgetown, should not be treated this lightly. I strongly encourage you to revise this with quotes and less biased opinions.

Georgetown University students and campus sustainability organizations joined thousands of young activists protesting the effects of climate change in the Washington, D.C. iteration of the first ever Global Climate Strike last Friday, Sept. 20.  
The D.C. Global Climate Strike included protests outside the Capitol building, with protestors holding signs to bring attention to the severity of the climate crisis. Around 50 Georgetown students attended the strike on Friday, according to Georgetown Renewable Energy and Environmental Network’s Environmental Justice Team co-leader Lucy Chatfield (COL ’22). GREEN and GU Fossil Free advertised the event to the Georgetown community by collaborating to create posters for the rally prior to the event.
Mass demonstrations such as the Global Climate Strikes help show how millions of people are passionate about addressing climate change, according to Chatfield. 
“The climate crisis is so daunting, and it’s so easy to feel, as an individual, that there’s nothing you can do about it,” Chatfield wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Participating in mass mobilizations like these is how I stay optimistic, because I know there are millions of others fighting alongside me.”
Given the long-lasting impacts of climate change, attending the strike helped emphasize how much advocacy and action is needed to properly address the climate crisis, according to GUFF core member Juliette Leader (SFS ’20). (Full disclosure: Leader is a former member of The Hoya’s editorial board).
“Climate change is an issue that will be irrevocably intertwined with our lives for decades to come and will touch on every aspect of our lives,” Leader wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It was a reinvigorating experience that reminded me of how justified we are in demanding climate action now and how important our work is.”
The Global Climate Strike occurred in the midst of the Climate Forum 2020 hosted at Georgetown featuring 12 presidential candidates on Sept. 19 and 20. The two-day forum provided candidates with the opportunity to hear student concerns about the climate crisis while proposing their own climate change policies. 
Both the Climate Forum 2020 event and the Global Climate Strike brought awareness and urgency to the climate crisis, according to Citizens’ Climate Lobby President Laura Rockefeller (SFS ’22).
“The forum and the protests are both so important in making climate a visible, visceral issue,” Rockefeller wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Global Climate Strike included participants, largely students and other young people, in more than 150 countries who protested to demand more governmental action on the climate crisis. The strike on Friday was the first of many protests happening throughout this week in light of the United Nations Climate Action Summit meeting in New York City on Sept. 23. 
The D.C. Global Climate Strike included multiple youth speakers highlighting their concerns with the climate crisis. Hearing young voices talk about the negative consequences of climate change on their futures resonated with Georgetown students, according to GREEN’s Environmental Justice Team member Grace Katz (COL ’23). 
“My favorite part was when they had the speakers,” Katz said. “They had one little boy who was a part of the movement suing the government for the air quality in their city, and this 12-year-old boy spoke about how he wants to have a future and that really hit me hard.”
As a part of the series of climate change protests this week, demonstrators in the Capitol Hill area of the District blocked traffic on Sept. 24, shutting down several road intersections as a part of the “Shut Down D.C.” initiative. The event led to the police arresting 26 protesters, according to The Washington Post.
The attention that large protests like the Global Climate Strikes draw highlight the younger generation’s responsibility to bring awareness to resolving urgent climate change problems, strike attendee Trey Di Bona (SFS ’23) said.
“I hope it convinces people of the immediacy of the problem,” Di Bona said. “It’s something we’ve been putting off for half a century now, and it’s not something we can put off any longer, and I think it sends a pretty strong message that it’s our generation’s duty to fix it.”

The markers used to make those posters, the ubers and buses used to go to the protest, and the litter left behind by these marchers was egregious and shameful—it would have been more beneficial to the planet if they had stayed home the entire day.
Those signs should be written in Mandarin, Hindi, and Turkish because India, China, and Turkey are emitting increasingly compared to the United States where cities like D.C., N.Y.C, S.F. and Philly (which are population centers) are banning plastic straws (DC), Styrofoam (NYC), plastic bottles (SF) and plastic single use bags (Philly) on top of instituting congestion pricing.

This year’s OUTober events will celebrate LGBTQ History Month through keynote speaker Mesma Belsaré, an Indian LGBTQ activist, and expanded programming which will involve a new Campus Ministry event.
Belsaré, an Indian transgender woman who is a classical Bharatanatyam dancer, painter and actor, will speak at an event called “The Creative Process” Oct. 10. The event will be sponsored by the South Asian Society, Rangila, the LGBTQ Resource Center, The Indian Initiative and Lecture Fund.
The event featuring Belsaré will focus on how her various social identities have shaped her journey in both art and dance. Belsaré will also discuss the principles of Bharatanatyam, the oldest classical form of Indian dance, and what her process to becoming established in the dance looked like as a member of the LGBTQ community, according to Rangila co-coordinator Avni Kulkarni (NHS ’21).
The event will also include a question and answer section where students will be able to engage in conversation with one another and hopefully discuss ways that the South Asian community can be more inclusive of LGBTQ members, according to Kulkarni.
“I hope this sheds light on what it means to hold LGBTQ identities in a South Asian place and what we can do as a community to make LGBTQ representation more inclusive within our community,” Kulkarni said.
Bringing Belsaré to talk about her experiences as a South Asian member of the LGBTQ community is important in bringing awareness to stigmas around sexuality within the South Asian community, according to Co-Director of Special Projects and Strategic Initiatives for Rangila Satya Adabala (SFS ’22).  
“I believe that it is truly important to reflect on the reality of some of the stigma in the South Asian community regarding LGBTQ identity, and as it is OUTober, we wanted to collaborate with the LGBTQ Resource Center to explore some of these important topics,” Adabala wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Campus Ministry will also host a LGBTQ-affirming mass for the first time on Oct. 20, according to LGBTQ Resource Center Director and Special Assistant to the Vice President of Student Affairs Sivagami Subbaraman.
“That is a big milestone for our communities and we are really grateful,” Subbaraman wrote in an email to The Hoya
OUTober will include the annual celebration for Coming Out Day in Red Square on Oct 11. The celebration will feature music and a “closet door,” which students can symbolically “come out” from, according to GUPride Co-President Siena Hohne (COL ’22).
GUPride will also be hosting a smaller, more casual event later that day for students to share their coming out stories and queer experiences in a more intimate setting, according to Hohne.
“Our goal for this event is to provide a space where closeted or more low-key members of the community can still feel celebrated and welcomed,” Hohne wrote in an email to The Hoya.
OUTober is a tradition that began in 2012 to honor LGBTQ History Month. The LGBTQ Resource Center celebrated its 10th anniversary during OUTober last year.
GUPride will potentially host an event for International Pronouns Day Oct. 16 and are in the process of finalizing their keynote speaker, according to Hohne. The official schedule for OUTober will be released next week, according to Subbaraman. 
OUTober provides students in the LGBTQ community an avenue to express their identity in a safe environment despite being unable to proudly express their sexuality in other circumstances, GUPride Co-President Al Castillo (SFS ’22) said.
“Many members of the queer Georgetown community are unable to be open about their sexuality or gender identity back in their hometown, for risk of social and familial rejection, violence, and discrimination,” Castillo wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In comparison, OUTober provides the opportunity for the community to be out and proud of their identity as a queer person on campus.”
This article was updated Oct. 4 to correct that campus ministry is hosting a new event for OUTober this year, not that this is the first time Campus Ministry has partnered with OUTober. The article was also updated to correctly reflect that Coming Out Day is Oct. 11 and that International Pronouns Day is Oct. 16.

Kuran Malhotra (MSB ’20), amid allegations that he fostered a toxic work environment and engaged in instances of inappropriate touching in social settings, was placed on an indefinite leave of absence from top leadership positions in two prominent student finance groups last week. 
Malhotra was suspended from his position as CEO of the Georgetown University Alumni and Student Federal Credit Union on Oct. 3, according to a same-day email to GUASFCU interns obtained by The Hoya. Malhotra was also placed on leave from his position as chief financial officer of the Hilltop Microfinance Initiative on Oct. 4, according to a message sent to HMFI staff obtained by The Hoya. 
Three former HMFI staffers and a current high-ranking GUASFCU leader, who all requested anonymity, described Malhotra’s domineering leadership style and outsized detrimental influence on the organizations’ cultures. Sources described a pattern of inappropriate touching and groping in social situations — characterized by a physical encroachment into personal space that surpassed friendly contact — coupled with inadequate redress of the behavior when concerns were raised to other group leaders. 
Malhotra has not responded to requests for comment on specific allegations at the time of publication. 
The Hoya does not have evidence of a Title IX complaint regarding Malhotra’s behavior. 
Crossing Lines
Malhotra has received two reprimands from GUASFCU leadership regarding inappropriate touching, according to the GUASFCU leader, the first during his freshman year and the second during his junior spring, just before he was confirmed as CEO of GUASFCU.
The previous year’s GUASFCU board is responsible for the selection of the new board every year. The 2018-19 board of directors, on which Malhotra served as chief technology officer, was made aware of allegations against Malhotra but still selected him as CEO, the GUASFCU leader said in an interview with The Hoya. 
“The old board votes on who the new CEO is, and he had enablers on that board who looked past those incidents,” the GUASFCU leader said. 
Another student familiar with the situation confirmed to The Hoya that accusations about Malhotra’s behavior, including inappropriate touching, began during Malhotra’s freshman year at the university.
GUASFCU is conducting an internal investigation into the allegations against Malhotra, according to an email to The Hoya from GUASFCU leadership.
“GUASFCU has been informed of allegations against a member of the Hilltop Microfinance Initiative who was also the GUASFCU Chief Executive Officer,” according to an Oct. 6 statement from the GUASFCU board of directors. “Given our concern for the interest and welfare of our interns and members, we have made changes to our board of directors and have begun an investigation related to GUASFCU.”
HMFI is also conducting its own investigation into the allegations, according to HMFI leadership.
“The Hilltop Microfinance Initiative was made aware of allegations regarding the professional conduct of our Chief Financial Officer, Kuran Malhotra, late last week,” HMFI wrote in an Oct. 9 statement to The Hoya. “As an organization entirely led by and comprised of Georgetown undergraduates, we take these allegations extremely seriously. The safety and comfort of our members remains our priority while reviewing the allegations brought forward.”
Neither GUASFCU nor HMFI leadership responded to requests for comment on specific allegations against Malhotra. 
All GUASFCU staff members are required to sign the organization’s Professionalism and Sexual Assault Policy agreeing to comply with the organization’s standards for conduct, according to a copy of the policy obtained by The Hoya. The policy applies to all actions between interns — the title given to all GUASFCU staff members — and non-GUASFCU members of the Georgetown community, as well as interactions between GUASFCU interns and members of the credit union both within the GUASFCU workplace and outside it. Staffers are required to sign the policy every 12 months, according to a student close to the situation.
HMFI members are not currently required to sign a policy regarding sexual misconduct, according to a former staffer. 
Before he held a position of leadership, Malhotra was approached informally by members of HMFI leadership on more than one occasion with concerns about his excessive drinking and inappropriate behavior that made staffers feel uncomfortable, according to another former HMFI staffer.
A separate former HMFI staffer detailed an experience at a party, when both had been drinking, at which Malhotra made the staffer uncomfortable with touchiness in their interactions. 
“I remember feeling like this is weird, like this should not be happening,” the former staffer said.
After informally raising the interaction to a member of HMFI leadership, the former staffer felt blamed for the encounter and underscored the power dynamics at play in this incident and other similar ones. 
The staffer later resigned from HMFI, motivated in part by Malhotra’s behavior and by a desire to gain distance from a culture that fostered manipulation and discomfort for its members.
“You allow this to happen constantly, and I don’t want to be responsible,” the former HMFI staffer said. “If something happens to a girl or a guy, I don’t want to be the one who’s complicit in this.”
Leadership, Power and Manipulation
Malhotra first became CFO of HMFI for a yearlong term in spring 2018 and was reappointed in spring 2019; he was chosen as CEO of GUASFCU in spring 2019. In over a year and a half with HMFI, he became a driving force of a culture of distrust and manipulation, according to the three former HMFI staffers. 
One of the former HMFI staffers told The Hoya that the club’s workplace environment was the most toxic they had ever witnessed because of Malhotra’s leadership. Malhotra micromanaged staffers outside of his responsibilities, seeking opportunities to increase his personal power regardless of the impact of this pursuit on other members of the organization, according to the staffer. Malhotra monopolized discussions and belittled and insulted the work of other staffers, the staffer said.
“Kuran is someone who likes power, and monopolizes it and abuses it,” the former staffer said, citing Malhotra as a primary reason why they resigned from the organization. 
The two other former HMFI staffers also cited Malhotra as a key factor in their departures from the organization. Malhotra is known to make staffers uncomfortable, both through verbal manipulation and rudeness in professional settings and inappropriate touching in social settings like HMFI parties. This behavior caused the departure of several staff members, according to the two former HMFI staffers. 
“It just makes me feel like there’s this power dynamic going on that’s palpable. People know; we don’t say anything,” one of the former staffers said. “That’s part of the reason why I quit.” 
Within GUASFCU, Malhotra created a culture of fear by using bullying tactics, like privately berating those who confronted or displeased him, according to the GUASFCU leader. Malhotra would occasionally arrange one-on-one meetings with staffers outside of the office, during which he would criticize them at length. 
“He’s just attacking, and he will invoke whether you’re even capable of doing the job or whether you have the intellectual rigor to work in this thing,” the GUASFCU leader said. “He’s a bully, and that’s part of the reason that it was so hard to get him out.”
Dismissal of Repeated Concerns
In addition to concerns about inappropriate touching, several HMFI staffers resigned because of Malhotra’s rude or manipulative behavior toward them or their awareness that Malhotra had acted inappropriately with others and leadership declined to take action, two HMFI staffers said. 
One former HMFI staffer recalled formally expressing concerns about Malhotra’s behavior to leadership but felt the feedback was not followed up on.
“I know that that’s not the first time that someone has complained about him to leadership, and they kind of said, ‘Ok, we’ll handle it,’ and then not done anything,” the former HMFI staffer said.
Some of the former staff members who also quit because of Malhotra voiced their concerns to leadership but did not feel that HMFI’s response was sufficient.
“I have other people I know who’ve quit, under the condition that they’d love to stay and help HMFI as long as Kuran was gone, and they were told that would never happen,” one of the former HMFI staffers said. “They were unwilling to take action, not even to remove him, but just to broach this topic with him that he’s had a lot of complaints.”
HMFI leadership said it did formally share feedback with Malhotra last semester.
“In Spring 2019, we had provided Kuran with written feedback and two members of the leadership team had conversations with him over the phone and in person,” HMFI leadership wrote in an Oct. 10 email to The Hoya. “Because we take honest feedback seriously, the process is both anonymous and confidential.”
Malhotra’s financial experience and expertise were enough for HMFI leadership to justify maintaining his role as CFO, according to one of the former staffers.  
“I have been told that nothing will be done,” one of the former HMFI staffers said. “That Kuran is such an important asset because he has so much knowledge.”
Malhotra’s competence and dedication to his work played a similar role in the 2018-19 GUASFCU board of directors’ decision to promote him to CEO, according to the GUASFCU leader. 
“He spent countless hours there; he was a huge force behind the development of the credit union in driving revenues and cutting expenses,” the GUASFCU leader said. “He did a lot for the business.”
The decision to prioritize Malhotra’s anticipated effectiveness as CEO over concerns about his inappropriate professional and social behavior partially results from the preprofessional culture of GUASFCU and from Malhotra’s intimidation of those who opposed him, according to the GUASFCU leader. 
“They’re certainly not going to cause a ruckus and potentially jeopardize moving up because Kuran was known to be very vindictive in terms of allowing people to move up,” the GUASFCU leader said. 
The failure of HMFI’s leadership to take action on Malhotra’s harmful behavior and broader concerns about the club’s culture created a toxic atmosphere, one former HMFI staffer said. 
“I think the point is that it’s a hostile work environment, and I don’t feel safe mentally or in a physical setting with these people,” the former HMFI staffer said. “And I think that’s the point — it’s supposed to be fun. It’s a freaking club.”

Let’s be clear — even though the article mentions “sexual assault” and “sexual misconduct”, no person has accused him of such transgressions.
I wonder what are the limits of the Hoya’s libel insurance policy.  
What does “toxic” mean?

This is the silliest thing I’ve ever read. Beyond the fact that the Hoya fabricated this story and my friends and I were asked to lie to get him removed, there’s clearcut evidence of racism in GUASFCU and people always talk about how they hate having indian ceos. the fact that this is still up is horrible, and the hoya is perpetuating horrible racism and making it harder for survivors to tell their stories when they post fake news like this

The A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation donated $12.2 million to the McDonough School of Business to support scholarships and collaboration with local educational programs, Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) announced in an email to the community Oct. 16.
The foundation’s donation will go towards expanding undergraduate need-based scholarships, strengthening education in real estate and providing leadership education in partnership with District of Columbia Public Schools and Public Charter Schools, according to a university news release. 
The Clark Foundation is a family foundation named after A. James Clark, a real estate executive whose firm designed many Washington, D.C. landmarks, such as the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of the American Indian and Nationals Park, as well as the Southwest Quadrangle buildings on campus.
The new financial support will enable the MSB to expand programs that are central to the school’s goals, according to MSB Dean Paul Almeida.
“The Clark Foundation funding addresses three key areas of importance for the McDonough School of Business — undergraduate scholarships, academic excellence, and leveraging our expertise as a world-class business school to make a difference in our community,” Almeida wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Clark Foundation will invest $3.5 million to expand the Robert J. & Elizabeth Flanagan Family Endowed Scholarship Fund, a fund for undergraduate scholarships.
Broadening the Flanagan Family fund will increase the MSB’s ability to support individuals in need of financial aid, according to a university spokesperson.
“These funds are critical to the university’s ongoing priority of making a Georgetown education accessible to talented students with financial need,” the university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The MSB hopes to ensure that financial need does not restrict students from attending Georgetown, according to Almeida.
“At Georgetown, we believe a world-class education should be accessible to everyone regardless of their financial circumstances,” Almeida wrote. “I have met so many successful alumni—many of whom are the chief executives in their organization—who share that they could not have attended Georgetown without the financial support we offer as a need-blind institution.”
The Clark Foundation will invest $6 million to establish the A. James Clark Endowed Chair in Global Real Estate at the Georgetown University Steers Center for Global Real Estate, an initiative launched in 2015 to strengthen real estate education, according to a university spokesperson. 
The establishment of the endowed chair in global real estate will strengthen the global aspect of the Steers Center, according to professor Matthew Cypher, director of the Steers Center.
“The goal of the Steers Center is to build a globally pre-eminent real estate program so the A. James Clark Endowed Chair in Global Real Estate is another huge step in that direction,” Cypher wrote in an email to The Hoya. “This center is now directly tied to Robert Steers and Mr. Clark who are global figures that have meaningfully influenced real estate and the built environment over their careers.”
The donation to the real estate program will also allow the MSB to expand its real estate faculty, providing students with more opportunities, Almeida said.
“Part of what makes the Georgetown experience so transformational for our students is our ability to attract the best professors to the school,” Almeida said. “Having an endowed chair allows us to offer more opportunities to our students.”
The Clark Foundation is also investing $2.7 million to support the participation of DCPS and Public Charter School principals in the MSB’s Executive Master’s in Leadership program, a program for working professionals aimed at teaching effective leadership behaviors, the university spokesperson wrote.
The donation to the EML program helps develop future leaders in D.C. schools, according to professor Robert Bies, founder of the EML program.
“The generous support of the A. James & Alice B. Clark Foundation is so critical to the mission of this program—bringing together DCPS and Public Charter School leaders to deepen and broaden their capacity to lead their schools and make a difference in the lives of young people in Washington, DC,” Bies wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are so blessed to have the Clark Foundation support—and so are the school leaders and the students that they serve.”
Part of the MSB’s responsibility as a leading business school is to change the world through teaching others, which is one of its priorities in utilizing this donation, according to Almeida.
“As one of the world’s best business schools, Georgetown McDonough seeks ways to impact the world through our ability to teach others,” Almeida said. “I can think of no better way to impact our D.C. community than working with the public schools to strengthen the leadership and innovation skills of their principals and administrators.”

Religious communities inadequately confront sexuality, alienating their members, students and religious leaders said at a Nov. 6 panel hosted by the LGBTQ Resource Center and Campus Ministry. 
The event, “Desire, Pleasure, & Faith: A Conversation,” featured the Director for Dharmic Life Brahmachari Sharan and Senior Research Fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs Jerry McGlone S.J. Students Mariah Johnson (COL ’21) and Saisha Mediratta (SFS ’20) shared their perspectives on sexuality, abstinence and chastity in the Healey Family Student Center Herman Meeting Room. 
The event was a part of OUTober, a month-long set of programs sponsored by the LGBTQ Center during LGBTQ History month in October and November. Other events coordinated with Campus Ministry included a tea with Campus Ministry chaplains on Oct. 1 and a Mass of Belonging held at Dahlgren Chapel on Oct. 20.
Mediratta, whose family is Punjabi, said that early cultural experiences shaped her understanding of sexuality.
“Growing up we did not talk about sex, pleasure, the in-between, or even really dating,” Mediratta said. “My deepest struggle with navigating a journey around my life, my body and my choices is my very Indian family where faith, tradition and culture are so deeply intertwined, but it was self-policing in a tradition where we do not talk about these issues openly yet obsess over them covertly.”
Dharmic traditions, which include religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, have a wide range of beliefs and teachings on sex. Those beliefs have changed throughout history because of colonial influences and changing social norms in South Asia, according to Sharan. 
Johnson, who was raised Catholic, did not engage in conversations about sexuality with family and was encouraged to practice abstinence throughout childhood, Johnson said. 
“I didn’t really process what I was taught about abstinence and dating super deeply throughout adolescence but these views did stay with me, largely unquestioned, until college,” Johnson said. “When I started to learn more and more about myself here at Georgetown I started to question more and more why I believed so strongly in abstinence.”
Rigid Catholic teachings on sexuality present a dilemma for people who support the LGBTQ community, according to McGlone. The struggle for many Catholics is how to disagree thoughtfully with the aspects of doctrine that one feels are not essential to the faith, McGlone said.  
The event was organized to facilitate a dialogue between students and religious leaders, according to Shiva Subbaraman, the director of the LGBTQ Resource Center. Provoking discussion around issues of sexuality is especially important for building trust with members of Campus Ministry, Subbaraman said. 
“Part of the struggle they have as monks and priests is students look at them and they don’t trust them,” Subbaraman said in an interview with The Hoya. “Part of my hope was not only to have the students think through this but to demystify them to say they’re human, they struggle, they have always struggled and it’s okay to ask them these questions or share with them.”
Contemporary norms around sexuality have been shaped by antiquated religious teachings, Sharan said. 
“The way we were socialized was to look at books made expressly for nuns and monks and make people think that was how we were supposed to be, which is ridiculous,” Sharan said. 
Lack of familial and societal conversations around sex and spirituality can be harmful to well-being, according to McGlone.  
“We understand the role religion can play in harming individuals but also the possibility of making and supporting health,” McGlone said. “This is not just a faith problem — this is a societal problem if we don’t talk about sexuality in this open and honest way enough.”

Students have signed a letter calling for the new MedStar Georgetown University Hospital surgical pavilion to be named after Eileen Niedfield (MED ’51), valedictorian of the first class of women accepted to the Georgetown University Medical Center. 
The Nov. 14 letter, signed by six student organizations and 18 students at the time of publication, argues that the surgical pavilion, which is currently under construction between Darnall Hall and the main MedStar buildings, should be named after Niedfield. A member of the Medical Mission Sisters religious order, she served as a surgeon in India for over 40 years. 
The letter comes after a corresponding resolution passed by the Georgetown University Student Association senate at its Nov. 3 meeting. The resolution was sponsored by senators Daniella Sanchez (COL ’22) and Joshua Marin-Mora (SFS ’21) and passed the senate with 24 votes in support and two abstentions. 
Marin-Mora, who also serves as the transportation and accessibility policy chair for the senate, decided to draft the resolution after reading an op-ed published in The Hoya by C.C. Borzilleri (COL ’19) in January 2019 calling for the new building to be named after Niedfield. 
“I thought it was a profoundly written article and that is when I turned to Daniella to talk to her to see if she’d be interested in the idea that C.C. had initially proposed,” Marin-Mora said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Borzilleri’s wrote the op-ed after she completed a project with the Georgetown Women’s Alliance to hang panels in the Hoya Court highlighting the stories of women graduates of Georgetown University.
While researching for the program, Borzilleri discovered Niedfield’s story, which she said was a particularly notable example of women’s contributions to Georgetown. 
“During the exhibit research process one of the hardest parts was selecting which of Georgetown’s women to highlight: there are just so many worthy of recognition,” Borzilleri wrote in an email to The Hoya. “One story which particularly struck me was Niedfield’s, and the construction of the Pavilion was in its earliest stages at this point, so I thought there might be a chance to get this idea out there early before the building could be named after someone else.”
Sanchez, who serves as the vice chair of the senate policy and advocacy committee and the gender equity policy chair, believes naming this new building after Niedfield would be a positive step toward better memorializing women on campus.
“Georgetown can improve on highlighting women of the church, they can improve on highlighting women’s narratives through events,” Sanchez said. “They can just provide a lot more attention to us presently and that would help institutionalized gender equality for the future.”
Georgetown traditionally names university buildings after historical figures, major donors or individuals who served within the university administration, according to Sanchez. Few campus buildings are named after individual women. 
In 2013, there was a similar campus-wide initiative focused on naming a building. A GUSA senator advocated for the newest residence hall to be named after Pedro Arrupe, S.J., the 28th superior general of the Society of Jesus. This initiative inspired her January 2019 op-ed, according to Borzelleri. 
Student organizations that have signed the letter at the time of publication include Hermanas de Georgetown, the Latin American Student Association, Georgetown Latinx Leadership Forum, the Patrick Healy Fellowship, the Central American United Student Association and Georgetown Disability Alliance. 
The Georgetown Disability Alliance cited the positive implications of the bill as reasoning for the group’s decision to sign the petition, according to GDS founder and board member Anna Landre (SFS ’21).
“GDA believes that the work of women has been marginalized in the history of Georgetown and, of course, in the world beyond,” Landre wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We need to work to correct this bias and that’s why we’re excited about the prospect of highlighting the work of a fantastic alumna through the name of the new Medstar building.”
This article has been updated to correct the spelling of C.C. Borzilleri’s name and include her school and graduation year at Georgetown. The headline was also updated to clarify the nature of the petition.

Environmental injustice and disasters are linked to issues surrounding disability, poverty and racism, University of Alabama social and cultural studies professor Nirmala Erevelles said at an event Nov. 13.
The event “Disability, Eco(in)justice and Transnational Solidarity,” was sponsored by the disability studies program, the South Asian Society and Rangila, an annual, student-run philanthropic showcase of South Asian dance. Erevelles focused on how ecological injustice creates barriers for marginalized groups, citing environmental crises in Bhopal, India and Flint, Mich.
An act of negligence led to a gas leak at the Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal in 1984 that exposed 600,000 residents to 30 tons of toxic and poisonous gas. The pesticide plant accident, caused by water entering a tank of toxic methyl isocyanate, caused the deaths of between 3,800 to 16,000 residents, according to The Atlantic. 
The pesticide plant accident disproportionately affected impoverished citizens in Bhopal who were forced to live in affordable housing made cheaper by its proximity to the plant, according to Erevelles. 
“Because Bhopal in India was promising jobs, there were a lot of people who migrated from the rural areas into the city and because they couldn’t afford housing in the big city, they built these little shantytowns across from the plant,” Erevelles said. “On the day when the gases escaped from the plant, people were dying in the space because many of them lived outside.”
The incident in Bhopal demonstrates how social and historical context in environmental crises can cause marginalized community members to become disabled, according to Erevelles.  
“Where here you don’t get just born with a disability, you could become disabled within certain violent historical, social and political conditions,” Erevelles said. “You’re not just born disabled, you can become disabled because of this kind of environmental injustice.” 
The water crisis in Flint, Mich. parallels the situation in Bhopal, India, according to Erevelles. In 2014, the city of Flint switched its municipal water source to a pipeline connected to the Flint River in order to cut costs for the town. After the pipeline switch, residents reported changes in water color and smell. In 2015, the water in Flint was tested and found to contain dangerous levels of lead, among other possible contaminants. 
Governmental negligence in addressing the Flint water crisis in a timely manner has led to numerous negative health outcomes, according to Erevelles. 
“It can cause health problems, it can decrease bone and muscle growth, poor muscle coordination, damage to the nervous system, kidneys or hearing, speech and language problems, developmental delays, seizures and unconsciousness in cases of extremely high lead levels and behavioral challenges,” Erevelles said.
The Flint water crisis has been unresolved for four years, leading to criticism of the government’s slow response. Reluctance to aid the people of Flint, nearly half of whom are black, is largely because of a lack of value placed on black lives, according to Erevelles. 
“Vulnerable bodies are devalued,” Erevelles said. “An invulnerable body, we presume, produces profit. A vulnerable body sucks profit from spaces.”
To address conversation surrounding disabilities on campus, Georgetown University approved the disability studies minor in 2017, after three years of advocacy by the Disability Studies Minor Working Group. The minor focuses on the intersectionality between disability, philosophy and women’s and gender studies, among other disciplines.
Georgetown can better understand the connection between disability and environmental injustice through collaborations between the disability studies program and sustainability student organizations, according to event attendee and disability studies professor Libbie Rifkin. 
“I think that, among other things, there should be more collaboration between disability studies and climate justice initiatives on campus,” Rifkin said in an interview with The Hoya. “There’s great work to be done and I know a lot of students are really interested in climate change. I think it’s important to bring disability into the conversation.” 
Providing equitable access to education to marginalized and impoverished communities is crucial in improving accessibility, according to Erevelles.  
“Education should be a space where people are nurtured to be the best they can be on their terms, not on standards,” Erevelles said.

Sara Rotenberg (NHS ’20) became the first student from the Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies studies to be named a 2020 Rhodes scholar from Canada, according to a Nov. 23 university news release.
Winners of the Rhodes scholarship, the oldest international fellowship in the world, can pursue a degree at The University of Oxford in Oxford, England. Rotenberg, a global health major, will pursue a master’s degree while studying evidence-based social intervention and policy evaluation in fall 2020, according to the news release.  
Rotenberg first learned she had received the scholarship in November while she was visiting family in Canada. While the scholarship surprised Rotenberg, it validates her hard work and academic accomplishments, she said in an interview with The Hoya. 
“It was a bit of a blur, I’d say, and I was with my parents, and we were all very excited. We all cried a bit and hugged each other. It was a good moment,” Rotenberg said. “I’ve worked very hard, and I’ve had a lot of very cool experiences, so it’s nice to be recognized for that, but ultimately I think a lot of it is about what’s next.”
At Georgetown, Rotenberg completed a student fellowship with the Georgetown University Global Health Initiative and wrote a paper about population policies in sub-Saharan Africa with global health professor John May. The two presented their work at the Population Association of America annual conference in Austin, Texas, in April 2019.
The pair submitted their paper to a peer-reviewed journal, which is currently considering the work for publishing. Throughout the process, Rotenberg exhibited an understanding of difficult demography concepts and an excellent work ethic, according to May. 
“I was really impressed because of her quick grasp of the technicalities of demography,” May wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’m impressed by her drive and hard work, she’s a young person but she knows exactly what she wants to do and where she wants to go.”
Rhodes scholars are chosen annually after applicants undergo a written application, a series of interviews and formal receptions with former panelists and former Rhodes scholars. Thirty-two winners are selected from the United States; however, Rhodes scholarships are also available to citizens of certain other countries. The scholarship had a 0.7% acceptance rate in 2017, with accepted candidates being chosen for their academic merit, character, leadership and commitment to the common good, according to the Rhodes Trust website.
While abroad in Mumbai, India, this summer, Rotenberg researched the accessibility of the Mumbai Metro system, one of the world’s largest development infrastructure projects. Her research was aimed towards offering suggestions for how the Mumbai Metro could become the first universally accessible metro system to individuals with disabilities.
Rotenberg was able to present the results of her research to Mumbai Metro planning team officials, who are receptive to her ideas, according to Rotenberg.
“I got to show their planning team how they can be accessible, and they’re very interested in working with me and professor Irfan Nooruddin, who runs the India initiative, and continuing to see how we can do that,” Rotenberg said. “So that’s pretty exciting, and we just want a grant for that so we can continue that work.”
The Rhodes Trust was established in 1903 after Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman and colonial politician, organized for scholarships to be set up in his name in his will. Trustees for the Rhodes Trust manage the fund for these scholarships and help ensure the continuity of the scholarship. 
Rotenberg is the 27th Rhodes scholar from Georgetown. The last Rhodes scholar from the university was Deirdre Collins (COL ’17), who was granted the distinction from Bermuda in 2018. Alumnus and former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) also stands among Georgetown’s recipients of the fellowship, though he was honored after graduating from Georgetown.
Receiving the scholarship is a significant distinction that reflects Rotenberg’s overall character, University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) wrote in an announcement on the university’s website.
“This is an extraordinary accomplishment and our entire Georgetown community joins me in offering our sincere congratulations to Sara,” DeGioia wrote. “Her dedication to her studies as well as her advocacy for the equity of people with disabilities embodies the very best of our values as a University, and we look forward to all she will accomplish as she pursues graduate work at the University of Oxford.”
The Rhodes scholarship will give Rotenberg the opportunity to continue her work on disability inclusion advocacy in international development, which she has been studying through her major, she said. 
“My proposal is working on disability inclusion and international development, so it’s really ‘How can I use the next two years to build a body of evidence and inspire policy that is disability inclusive?’” Rotenberg said. “That’s what that means to me and where I’m going with it, and I’m really excited about that.”
Correction: This article was updated Dec. 7 to clarify the nature of Rotenberg’s work researching the Mumbai Metro.

Global leaders must prioritize protecting religious minorities against persecution and violence, Prince Zeid bin Ra’ad al-Hussein of Jordan said at a Thursday event.
Zeid served as United Nations high commissioner for human rights from 2014 to 2018, during which he condemned extremism in the Middle East, South America and Eastern Europe. He also assisted in the 2002 founding of the International Criminal Court, an intergovernmental judicial body that prosecutes global crimes against humanity. Zeid discussed the threats to coexisting belief systems at the March 5 event in Copley Formal Lounge.  
Religious pluralism reveals the common humanity in all people that fanatical, violent organizations often obscure, according to Zeid. 
“We as humans are much more complex,” Zeid said. “We are also better human beings than the extremists on both sides would have us believe.” 
Attacks on worshippers and their religious spaces have pervaded the international religious landscape in recent years, according to Zeid. As the world faces ongoing attacks on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, violence against Uyghur Muslims in China, the publicly streamed mosque shooting in New Zealand, attacks on synagogues in the United States and church bombings in Egypt and Burkina Faso, the violence has desensitized society’s reaction, according to Zeid.
“The recent ongoing violence against believers or those of a different belief has been not short of numbing,” Zeid said.
Heads of state are typically responsible for leading the charge of violence against religious minorities, according to Zeid. They often instruct their citizens to target minority groups through lies and dog whistles, he said. 
“Pick a target, and through a combination of half truths and insinuation, attack them, but indirectly, while allowing or quietly prompting your followers to do so directly, all the time denying you have anything to do with the violence when it results,” Zeid said. “The xenophobia, racism and religious intolerance does not also come out of nowhere; it feeds off of a less apparent structure of the state, discriminations and prejudices that already exist in practically all societies, and are amplified by the use of hypotheticals.”
Zeid was joined by panelists Asma Afsaruddin, a professor of near Eastern languages and culture at Indiana University Bloomington, John Borelli, the special assistant for Catholic identity and dialogue to University President John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79, GRD ’95) and Thomas Michel, vice president for academic affairs at the Xavier Learning Community in Chiang Rai, Thailand. The event, titled “The Challenge of Pluralism in the 21st Century,” was hosted by the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. 
Cooperation among people of different faiths combats ignorance regarding religious pluralism, according to Borelli. 
“Ignorance, yes, is one of the items, one of the challenges that we face regarding religious pluralism,” Borelli said. “Some of that ignorance is addressed through education, and a lot of the ignorance can be overcome through action and acting together.” 
Zeid served as the Jordanian ambassador to the U.N. and the United States before he was appointed U.N. high commissioner for human rights. During his tenure, he was noted for condemning xenophobic rhetoric, ranging from that of the Islamic State to that of world leaders like U.S. President Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, the president of the French National Rally Party. 
Working at the U.N. revealed the dysfunction among global forces when enforcing peace and security internationally, according to Zeid. 
“For many years, I had an orchestra seat in the playhouse of international relations, the U.N. Headquarters in New York, watching at times with utter bewilderment for the cowardice, double standards and hypocrisy of states,” Zeid said. “I therefore have no illusions of what we are, or what harm we are capable of.”

When Georgetown University students set out for spring break March 6, the coronavirus threat seemed distant, but looming. COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, claimed its first life in the United States less than a week before. As the virus raged across Europe and Asia, the university suspended international trips, but U.S. cases remained low and campus remained open. 
However, as students sought relaxation at crowded beach resorts and family outings, anxiety mounted. What was once an international concern quickly became a domestic one. The virus continued to spread and death tolls climbed. One day after spring break began, Washington, D.C., confirmed its first case of COVID-19. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic, certifying the severity of the crisis. 
Universities across the United States took drastic measures to contain the outbreak, shifting classes online and telling students to move out of residence halls. Georgetown followed suit March 13. During the past month, the university has canceled all study abroad programs, postponed commencement ceremonies and pushed classes online for the remainder of the semester. 
The crisis that has upended life across the globe has derailed life at Georgetown. The Hoya interviewed students from some of the most affected campus communities by phone, video and text to get a sense of how the pandemic and the university’s responses are impacting their lives. 
First-Generation, Low-Income Students 
After Georgetown shut down its campus, Sarah Craig (SFS ’22) returned to her hometown of Detroit, where she had to undertake duties many of her peers do not have to perform.
Michigan closed its K-12 schools until the end of the school year in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. With her parents working full time in hospitals, Craig now has to help home-school her younger brother as she keeps up with assignments and virtual class sessions, she said. 
“I know a lot of first-generation, low-income students are facing similar challenges with financial issues and having to support younger siblings,” Craig said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “That’s still something I’m navigating — the emotional challenges of this, of now having these extra responsibilities.” 
Onrei Josh Ladao (COL ’21), a San Diego native, has also had to manage new responsibilities after returning home. 
“Just by the virtue of being back in San Diego with my family, I can’t be a student in the same way anymore,” Ladao wrote in a message to The Hoya. “I’m helping my family where I can, meaning I have to juggle those responsibilities while also being a student.”
There isn’t the time to create support for those students, and so we just kind of get left behind. – Sarah Craig (SFS’22)
Craig and Ladao are both first-generation college students from low-income backgrounds. Uprooted from a university setting, they will have to navigate a distinct set of obstacles to reconstruct their college lives at home. 
One of the biggest challenges is continuing academic life in an unfavorable learning environment, according to Craig. 
“I think it’s still just the uncertainty of returning to my house that is not suited for academics of this level,” Craig said. “Because my parents didn’t go to college, they don’t really understand just the degree of school that I’m doing. They don’t really have an understanding of what it means to be in school full time like this.”
Besides having to adjust to time differences, Ladao has encountered similar barriers to effective learning. 
“Making your home the new classroom is not an easy task,” Ladao wrote. “My family’s apartment is not conducive as a learning environment, and I have to make adjustments to the space around me in order to make it so.”
On March 17, Georgetown moved up the mandatory move-out date for students living in university-owned housing, ordering campus residents to retrieve their belongings before March 22. Previously, students had until March 29 to move out of their dorms. 
The anxiety of having to return home at a moment’s notice was compounded by countless financial considerations. 
“So many questions had clouded my mind,” Ladao wrote. “How was I going to pay for storage? Do I need to drop even more money to book a flight back to D.C.? Is it even safe for me to go back to D.C., considering the circumstances? There was no sense of stability whatsoever, and it wasn’t easy to make decisions because everything continued to change.” 
Low-income families must handle an extra financial burden when their kids return home from college, since their day-to-day expenses are largely covered by the university, Craig said. 
“For students who are either paying very little for school or they’re fully covered in terms of expenses and tuition, that’s one less person in a household that their family has to feed and take care of and provide for,” Craig said. “Now the student is returning to live with them and that’s one extra person the family has to provide for.”
Nationwide, a growing number of young adults raised in low-income households are attending college, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center study. Just under 40% of Georgetown students receive some amount of need-based financial aid, with the average grant covering $45,585 in fees, according to U.S. News.
As families gather resources to support returning students, students themselves have lost essential benefits offered by a college campus, Ladao wrote.  
“Georgetown may have been their source for mental health resources because it’s not available to them at home,” Ladao wrote. “Furthermore, especially as we are transitioning to virtual instruction, access to the internet—a necessity for the classroom—may be out of reach.”
Support from the university has been present but lagging, Ladao added. The initial March 11 email from the university announcing the transition to distance learning did not include specific resources for first-generation, low income students.
“From the student perspective, I feel that FGLI students, throughout the transition, have been treated as an afterthought,” Ladao wrote. “While some of these issues have finally been addressed in follow-up emails, the university ought to take this experience as a lesson for being more conscious and aware of low-income students at the very beginning. The emotional, physical and financial distress that tone-deaf university communications have caused is irreparable.”
Many elite universities were not designed to prioritize the needs of first-generation, low-income students, Craig said. 
“Institutions like Georgetown are not inherently created to support first-gen, low-income students and students of color,” Craig said. “Those efforts that do support those students take time to create and create integral change, but when you have a crisis like the pandemic, there isn’t time to create integral change because the university has to change things so often. There isn’t the time to create support for those students, and so we just kinda get left behind.”
The university has tried to take some steps to ease the financial burden of the transition. Georgetown teamed up with private storage providers to offer students discounts on storage, according to a March 15 email from Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Geoff Chatas. Two days later, Provost Robert Groves announced by email that the university would be covering the wages of student workers for the rest of the semester. 
Amid the turmoil, students have played a significant role in supporting one another. Craig’s friend offered to store her belongings at her home for free. Ladao has collaborated with other student activists to lobby the university for increased financial and academic accommodations for less privileged members of the community. Students have also compiled and circulated a 12-tab spreadsheet with lists of food, funding and other resources. 
Ladao said the willingness of students to support one another has persisted, despite the uncertainty of the situation. 
“It’s been wonderful to see students checking up on one another and ensuring that we’re all in this together,” Ladao said. “Nothing has been too big or too small to contribute to this grand effort to help one another.”
Seniors
The university’s decision to go digital seemed surreal at first, Samira Mehta (SFS ’20) said. 
“At the beginning, I think we were all a little stunned when the news came out. We were like, ‘This doesn’t seem necessary,’” Mehta said in a phone interview with The Hoya. 
As the severity of the crisis became apparent, Mehta and many of her senior classmates were confronted with a difficult reality. The pandemic would take away the quintessential conclusion of their college careers, Mehta said.
“It was devastating to say goodbye to friends prematurely, to have to forgo senior spring and all of the events that that holds and to not quite get the closure to a major chapter in my life,” Mehta said. 
As the pandemic worsened in mid-March, U.S. health officials warned against hosting large gatherings. Many U.S. universities took further precautions by postponing or canceling their graduation ceremonies. 
Every May, graduating seniors gather with classmates, faculty and family at commencement to commemorate the achievements of the Georgetown senior class. For many, the ceremony is a momentous culmination of the college experience, Mehta said. 
“A lot of times commencement and the last couple of months give you that chance to reflect and really move through all that you’ve experienced here,” Mehta said. “Each day you move a little bit forward, and you don’t really feel yourself doing it. Even studying abroad, taking a class outside of your major — you just learn so much.” 
Over 1,000 students, parents and faculty signed a March 17 open letter to the university, encouraging the administration to postpone commencement instead of canceling it. 
On March 18, the university announced that it would postpone commencement activities to a time when community members could safely convene.
We’re all just a little devastated, but glad we have each other. – Samira Mehta (SFS’20)
Katrina Schmidt (SFS ’20), one of the letter’s original authors, said the lack of closure is one of the most painful consequences of the postponement. (Full disclosure: Schmidt formerly served as senior news editor for The Hoya). 
“I think in a university setting, it is really valuable, you know, when a lot of people are doing a lot of different things, where you can have those moments when you can all come together and recognize the shared experience that you had, and honor it and commemorate it,” Schmidt said in a video interview from her home in Baltimore. “I can lose senior ball, and I can lose the Tropaia ceremony. It doesn’t have to be Obama speaking at commencement, but I think there is a lot of value in, I think, properly honoring an experience.”
However disappointing the reality, Mehta recognized the necessity of the decision. 
“We understand that this is the right move by the university and it’s necessary,” Mehta said. “It was really, really comforting to see that they understand how much this means to us.”
The stress and unease of unsaid goodbyes are compounded by uncertainty in the world outside the campus gates, Mehta added. Graduating seniors are poised to enter an economy experiencing a recession, according to the International Monetary Fund. 
“A lot of students are worried about what next year is even going to look like. I think no one even knows when this is going to end because it is so unprecedented that it’s just a state of confusion and uncertainty,” Mehta said. 
Nevertheless, Georgetown seniors have found solace in solidarity, and many seniors are making up for graduation with less ceremonial moments of reflection. Mehta and Schmidt have managed to keep in touch with their classmates online.
Despite the challenges of losing senior spring, Mehta considers herself lucky. 
“Just knowing that we’re healthy and we have families to go back to I think is something that we’re really, really grateful for,” Mehta said. “We’re all just a little devastated, but glad we have each other.” 
Study Abroad 
The COVID-19 outbreak undid Nicole Ruggiero’s (SFS ’21) semester weeks before it upended life at Georgetown. Ruggiero, who is minoring in Italian, was studying abroad in Bologna, Italy, and found herself in the early throes of the COVID-19 crisis when she began her coursework at the beginning of February. 
Ruggiero and her peers shrugged off the early warning signs of disruption, she said. 
“I remember that when we first received the email from the University of Bologna that the university would not be having in-person lectures that week, most of us were like, ‘Okay that’s a precaution. We’ll be back to normal next week,’” Ruggiero said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “In fact, my friends and I booked a day trip to a town in northern Italy for the next day.”
As the crisis worsened, however, uncertainty began to set in, Ruggiero said. 
“Every 15 minutes or so there would be a public service announcement about the virus — about washing your hands, about looking out for symptoms — and everything just felt very off to me,” Ruggiero said, recalling a train trip. “Then by the time that they were saying that classes would be closed for a second week, I felt like we were just waiting to go home by that point.”
In late February, coronavirus cases in Italy surged to 400, and the death toll rose to 12, according to BBC. By the time the University of Bologna had organized an instructional continuity system online, Brown University, which ran Ruggiero’s program, had decided to pull the plug Feb. 29. Brown’s decision to cancel the program followed the Department of State’s travel warning encouraging Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to the country. 
It was a frenzy. – Nicole Ruggiero (SFS’21)
Georgetown had canceled its study abroad programs at Villa Le Balze in Florence, Italy, days earlier. The university also suspended all university-related travel to South Korea on Feb. 25 and to China on Jan. 28 because of mounting COVID-19 cases and fatalities. 
Ruggiero and her peers were initially angered by the cancellation, she said. 
“We still thought that this was being overly cautious. We thought that it wasn’t fair. We wanted to stay in Italy. We wanted to take the risk,” Ruggiero said. “And, I mean, if we had known what was going to happen, none of us would’ve wanted to stay, but at that point, we were just absolutely livid.” 
After digesting the severity of the situation, Ruggiero decided to return home. Coming home was no plain sailing process, she said. 
“I mean it was just hectic to pack and say goodbye to all of our friends, to tie things up with the program,” she recalled. “It was a frenzy.”
In accordance with the policy from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she self-quarantined for 14 days after her return to the United States.  
“I didn’t want to risk my parents getting it considering they’re members of a vulnerable population, so I had to take a taxi back,” Ruggiero said after her quarantine had ended. “My mom had left a pair of gloves and a mask outside for me and I just had to go upstairs to my bedroom without touching herself or even saying hello to her, and I stayed in here by myself for 14 days other than to go outside and shower.”
Georgetown officially recalled all of its students studying in the Schengen Area of Europe on March 12. Four days later, Georgetown suspended all of its study abroad programs. The university promised to work with students to manage reimbursement requests and help withdrawn students enroll in new classes, according to an email sent to study abroad students by Director of Global Education Craig Rinker. 
Over time, Ruggiero said she normalized the drastic shift in routine. 
“It was very tough, but like I said, by the end of it, it just becomes sort of routine and you develop a sense of a new normal and I just tried to keep in my head why I was doing it,” she said. “I do think that it just is going to be the responsibility of most of us right now to realize that this is our new reality and we’re going to have to take it on to protect our vulnerable populations, and I just thought a lot about my mom and my grandparents and that kept me in there and kept me going.”
Georgetown has helped study abroad students pay for flights and housing; however, a spokesperson did not directly state if the university would offer tuition refunds. 
“Georgetown is facilitating refunds to students for recoverable costs, like housing, from host programs. This is done as our partners are able to recover these costs on behalf of students,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown also provided financial support for repatriation costs (flight change fees, etc.) for our students abroad when they had to return to their permanent addresses at short notice.”
Many Georgetown students who have been pulled from their study abroad programs have also raised concerns about meeting their graduation requirements. Ruggiero and 48 other School of Foreign Service students penned a letter to SFS Dean Joel Hellman requesting greater flexibility with the 120-credit minimum requirement. The SFS requires that juniors and seniors take a minimum of 38 3-credit courses, but this requirement was cleared for sophomores and freshmen earlier this year. 
After the study abroad cancellations, the university created the GU Global Campus program, through which study abroad students can enroll in a special academic term titled Module C to fulfill their credit requirements for the semester. One hundred students have signed up for the program, which runs online from March 30 until June 12, according to a university spokesperson. 
Other study abroad programs continued their classes online. Ruggiero was able to continue her studies at the University of Bologna through a customized set of courses, she says. 
Ruggiero does not fault the university for its brisk response. The university, however, could have taken more steps to support students returning from abroad, she said. 
“I do think that Georgetown can and should do better in reaching out,” Ruggiero said. “If they’re going to make such a sweeping and difficult decision for students, they need to be more available to us.”
International Students
After Georgetown converted to online classes, Elliot Mack (SFS ’22) did not join the mass exodus of students leaving campus. In fact, he had no choice but to stay. 
“I am half-French, half-American. My parents live in Istanbul, Turkey,” Mack said in a video interview with The Hoya. “I do not have a residency permit anymore to live in Turkey because it expired one year after I left for college, so I cannot go back there since they’re not accepting tourists, especially French nationals. And even if they were, I would have to spend two weeks in quarantine in basically the middle of Turkey in these empty facilities, which obviously would impede strongly on my academic work.”
Though Mack is a U.S. citizen, he has no home base in the country, he said. 
“Although I’m a U.S. citizen, I do not have a U.S. permanent residency,” Mack said. “I don’t have really any other viable options in the U.S. that are feasible and not with immunocompromised people or that are not stressful situations.” 
Mack opted to stay on campus because of these complex circumstances, joining approximately 174 other undergraduate students who have not been able to return home, according to a March 30 universitywide email from Groves. After applying to stay on campus, Mack now lives with a roommate in a Village A apartment. 
Mack is one of 488 international undergraduate students attending Georgetown. International students have encountered unique obstacles adjusting to pandemic college life. Some are stranded in the United States away from their families, while others struggle to adjust back home. 
Ryan Kim (MSB ’22), a native of Seoul, South Korea, was also unable to return to his family. 
“Since my home country, South Korea, currently has a high infection rate, my parents and I decided I should stay here,” Kim said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I’m the only one here. All my family is in Korea. Fortunately, they are all safe and healthy.”
Students who wished to remain on campus had to fill out a form with the Office of Residential Living before March 17 to receive permission from the university to continue living in university-owned housing, according to an FAQ page on the university’s website.
Kim applied to live on campus, completing the required university survey. An anxious, class-packed week passed before his application was approved. 
“It’s been a very tough and challenging experience for me,” Kim said before getting his decision. “I was relieved at the same time because school did still give me the opportunity to stay here. But at the same time, I wish they could inform me earlier so that I don’t have to wait until this Friday.”  
Mack’s journey was more complicated. His initial application to stay on campus was denied. The university did not specify why, according to Mack. Mack was able to secure his on-campus housing only after numerous email follow-ups and the intervention of a faculty member. The university’s process for housing allocation was mechanical and inflexible, Mack said.
“First of all, it’s impersonal. And second of all, it’s like they know better than you when, realistically, they don’t know what your situation is,” Mack said. “It just feels like they don’t trust students to think through things and make the best decisions for themselves.” 
The struggle for housing was frustrating and isolating, he added. 
“I’m already alone in my apartment, and it’s weird that I have to fight to stay alone in my apartment. It doesn’t seem like an ideal situation and I don’t know why I’m fighting for a non-ideal situation, but it’s the best I got,” Mack said. “I was alone in it, and it took me so much energy — just personal will and energy — to change my situation.”
The university has considered every on-campus housing request carefully, even giving students the ability to explain their rationale for staying directly to administrators, according to a university spokesperson. 
I’m sleeping when they’re awake, and I’m awake when they’re about to go to bed. That’s the worst part. – Muhammad Ahsan Shafique (SFS’22)
“Each application was thoughtfully reviewed, and all students who asked to speak on their situation confidentially were reached out to by university staff,” the university spokesperson wrote.
Despite this practice, the university’s response to housing requests and to the crisis more broadly has lacked student input, Mack said.
“I think that they’ve been doing great at talking amongst themselves and organizing, but I don’t understand why there are not students in the rooms when they’re making these decisions,” Mack said. “Nobody knows better than we do what we need right now.” 
As some international students struggle to find accommodation in the United States, others are straining to recreate campus life at home.  
Muhammad Ahsan Shafique (SFS ’22) lives in Pakistan. When news of the university’s decision broke, his family ordered him to return home. Because of the nine-hour time difference, he now takes his classes at night and sleeps during the day. The routine is grueling, Shafique said. 
“There are so many problems with me coming here,” Shafique said in a video interview with The Hoya. “My sleep schedule is a mess. I go to bed at nine in the morning to noon, something like that, and I wake up between six and eight. So I’m basically on Eastern Time.” 
Though his professors have been very supportive, Shafique has struggled to manage the shift. 
“My body doesn’t let me concentrate, so I can’t do a lot of work. And, as you can imagine, I can’t socialize with my family,” he said. “I’m sleeping when they’re awake, and I’m awake when they’re about to go to bed. That’s the worst part.”  
Spotty internet and a deteriorating health crisis in Pakistan is compounding the stress. 
“It’s been pretty bad,” Shafique sighed.

Are there any places (study spaces, classrooms, dining places) still open at school? I went back home to North Carolina for spring break and have really struggled adjusting to online classes and living back at home. I had wanted to return to campus for the rest of the semester, but I have no idea how the conditions are at school.

Human encounters and on-the-ground campaigning are vital to the success of a presidential run, former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said in a virtual Zoom event March 31.
Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., became the first openly gay Democratic candidate to run for president in the United States when he launched his campaign in April 2019. The Indiana politician quickly garnered national attention and support for his presidential campaign, most notably winning the 2020 Iowa caucuses after a Feb. 27 recount of the Feb. 3 caucus, leading Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by a small margin. After a disappointing fourth-place finish in the South Carolina primary, however, Buttigieg decided to end his campaign March 1.
During the event, titled “Reflections on Running: A Conversation with Mayor Pete Buttigieg,” Buttigieg reflected on his nearly yearlong campaign and discussed what he learned about U.S. citizens during the campaign process. Future presidential elections should place a greater emphasis on in-person campaigning rather than TV commercials and other forms of money-based campaigning, according to Buttigieg.
“Whatever we come up with, I think it is really important that it be an approach that still makes it possible with eye-to-eye, in-person, in-your-face campaigning to cut through the media clutter and to get beyond the forms of attention that really can’t be bought by whoever has the most money to buy TV commercials,” Buttigieg said.
Campaigns are less often built on money or name recognition and more often on genuine interactions with voters, according to Buttigieg.
“The beauty of the process — the whole reason it can’t simply be bought by the person with the most money, the reason it is not simply handed to the person with the most name recognition — is that you have to go backyard by backyard, diner by diner, with crowds that started from eight or 12 or 20 in order to build the kind of campaign that could eventually have a crowd of 10,000,” Buttigieg said.
Buttigieg was one of the first Democratic presidential candidates to appear on a Fox News town hall, something many other Democratic candidates refused to do because of the network’s constant attacks against the Democratic party, according to CNN.
By appearing on platforms like Fox News, candidates can get their messages across to more voters, especially voters that may not initially support their campaign platforms, Buttigieg said.
“I also think you can’t be surprised if people don’t hear your message if they literally don’t hear your message because you have never been inside their media bubble,” Buttigieg said. “We tried to cover as much ground as we could knowing we weren’t going to come into a national conversation and immediately overtake U.S. senators or former vice presidents or cabinet secretaries but that we could at least establish a voice and gather some kind of following.”
The virtual event was co-hosted by the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service, Georgetown University College Democrats and the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition as part of the GU Politics “Reflections on Running” series. The series, which was launched in 2016, aims to bring former presidential hopefuls to campus to discuss the lessons they took away from the campaign trail, according to the GU Politics website.
As the first openly gay Democratic presidential candidate, Buttigieg acknowledged the importance of representing a certain identity without letting it define you or your campaign.
“For us, what we realized was the most important thing was to be very clear and upfront and true to who I was and at the same time never allow it to appear that I was running to be the president of gay America,” Buttigieg said. “I was just running to be the president of the United States of America.”
Buttigieg, who is 38 years old, was also the youngest candidate in the 2020 primary race and ran on a platform of generational change.
Rather than rushing to run for office, young people who are interested in politics should first focus on following their passions and developing the necessary skills and experience, Buttigieg said.
“What I would encourage anybody to do or to think about if you think you might have a future running for office is not to get too hung up on some game plan to run for this office or that office, but rather arm yourself with as many skills as you can and then look for ways you can make a difference,” Buttigieg said. “If you focus on the issues you care about and follow that wherever it takes you — and it might be activism or office or scholarship — that’s going to be a much more authentic path.”
This article has been updated to clarify that Buttigieg was the first openly-gay Democratic presidential candidate.

I enjoyed Annalise’s story in the Hoya about Pete Buttigieg, but he was not the 1st openly gay major-party candidate to run for president, I was back in 2012 and appeared on 6 state ballots. Common mistake with all Pete’s success and I was proud to support him. Could you please correct this story from ASAP? It’s important to keep LGBTQI+ history accurate. Thanks! https://www.politico.com/video/2019/06/30/fred-karger-buttigieg-2020-068424

From sidewalk concerts to a safari, Georgetown residents have been coming up with creative ways to cope with quarantine — all the while keeping a safe six feet apart.
Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) issued a stay-at-home order for District residents March 30, allowing residents to leave their homes only for essential tasks and some recreational purposes. Georgetown residents have been using the neighborhood social networking platforms Nextdoor and Groups.io to plan fun, safe activities during this uncertain time. 
A street concert planned on Nextdoor and performed by local residents gave neighbors the chance to enjoy each others’ company at a safe distance, according to Noa Donvan (COL ’22), whose permanent residence is in Georgetown. 
“The event was planned by my next door neighbor, who is in a band,” Donvan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “He ended up playing for about an hour and a lot of neighbors brought chairs and sat in the streets and outside of their houses with their families. He played a lot of songs that people knew so everyone was singing along, there were younger kids dancing, it was a really, really soothing and positive experience and environment.”
Advisory Neighborhood 2E Commissioner Elizabeth Miller used Georgetown’s community email lists and Nextdoor to inform neighbors about her idea for a daily neighborhood wave. 
“I started the daily friendly wave because I was so moved by the Italians singing from their balconies and I quickly understood how important community would be as the quarantine gets tighter and goes longer.  In times like these, kindness, love, support and even a friendly wave can go a long way to keeping us sane,” Miller wrote in an email to The Hoya. “It’s also a way to check on each other – especially our more mature neighbors – and make sure we have what we need and are staying healthy.”
Miller said some blocks have even adopted themes for each night’s wave, including a pajama night and a hat night. 
The Georgetown email list on Groups.io was the birthplace of the Georgetown Street Safari. India Olchefske and her mother, Judith Bunnell, began the safari by encouraging neighbors to place stuffed animals in their windows so Georgetown’s younger residents could walk around and spot them. With over 200 houses involved and a growing social media presence, the Street Safari has amassed more attention than Olchefske and Bunnell anticipated. 
The safari is a safe and fun activity for children and parents alike, serving as an opportunity to bring the neighborhood closer during the pandemic, according to Olchefske. 
“I think the idea is not only to give parents something to do with their kids that can maintain social distancing, but also to create community in a difficult time,” Olchefske said in an interview with The Hoya. “So if we can have kids in the community either take pictures of themselves, take pictures of family, take pictures of houses, or their house or their animal, hopefully it’ll create a sense of family.”
Some moments of community solidarity have been more spontaneous. Fran Snider discovered an anonymous note on her doorstep last week, thanking her for maintaining a beautiful garden for others to enjoy as they pass her house. 
“Thank you for your gorgeous garden. It’s at times like this that we need to be reminded of the true beauty of the world,” the handwritten note read. 
Since Snider found the first note, neighbors on her street have reported the discovery of similar ones. Although the identity of the notes’ writer remains a mystery, the sentiment behind the messages is characteristic of the Georgetown community, according to Snider. 
“It just seemed like such a nice thing to do when things are just falling apart. In Georgetown, people look out for each other,” Snider said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’ve lived here since 1972, so we’ve seen a lot of changes, but the thing that we have not seen change is that people take care of each other here.”

Postsecondary education can have a crucial role in suppressing authoritarian tendencies, particularly in the United States, according to a report published by a nonprofit research and policy institute at Georgetown University. 
The report, published by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce warned that the current global crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, mirrors similar historical contexts that gave rise to authoritarian regimes. In particular, the report noted growing political polarization in the United States has already intensified authoritarian attitudes and practices, including the use of mine-resistant vehicles and armored cars by police departments.
“Across the country, military and police vehicles patrolled the streets, sometimes using force against peaceful protesters calling for long-denied racial justice,” the report read. “With the presidential primaries complicated by the presence of COVID-19, concerns about potential voter suppression circulated. Shuttered educational institutions and businesses heightened the sense of uncertainty. Propaganda and traditional media competed fiercely to win credibility with a skeptical public.” 
The report, titled “The Role of Education in Taming Authoritarian Attitudes,” was published Sept. 22 and combined data from the World Values Survey, General Social Survey and American National Election Studies to analyze 51 countries. The report used the World Values Survey to rank them according to their authoritarian tendencies. 
The McCourt School of Public Policy professors at CEW Anthony P. Carnevale, Nicole Smith, Artem Gulish and Kathryn Peltier Campbell, as well as Lenka Dražanová of the European University Institute’s Migration Policy Centre, authored the report. CEW, a research policy center formed by Carnevale in 2008, studies the interaction between education and the workforce. 
Smith, chief economist at the CEW, said the use of authoritarianism in everyday language misses the full scope of what really constitutes an authoritarian state of affairs. 
“Most people go back to Nazi Germany, thinking of Adolf Hitler as an authoritarian and think that’s what an authoritarian is,” Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. “But the understanding of what authoritarianism really is is much more deep than just the political understanding.” 
The researchers operated under a definition of authoritarianism used by political scientist Karen Stenner, an influential definition in contemporary authoritarian research. Stenner considers authoritarianism to be a worldview wherein people prefer “authority and uniformity” before “autonomy and diversity,” according to the report. 
People who seek order in response to perceived threats to their way of life tend to favor authoritarianism, even in a democratic society like the United States, according to Smith.
“Authoritarianism is not the antithesis of a democratic understanding,” Smith said. “In fact, you can have an authoritarian outcome from a democratic regime.” 
Out of 51 countries studied, the report found that the U.S. population is the 16th-least authoritarian, indicating “moderate” authoritarian inclinations, roughly on par with Chile and Uruguay. The highest authoritarian tendencies were exhibited in India, Kyrgyzstan and South Africa, while the lowest levels were found in Germany, New Zealand and Sweden.
Against a volatile global context, the report identified education as a potential inhibitor for growing authoritarianism. It found that people with a bachelor’s degree or higher are seven times less likely to exhibit authoritarian preferences than people with a high school diploma. 
Education weakens authoritarian tendencies in part because it offers income and class benefits, which can decrease perceptions of threat, according to Smith.
“More education also affords you the ability to have a higher standard of living and to be upper income and upper class, and all these things are interrelated or commingled with education to lead to weaker authoritarian attitudes,” Smith said. 
Mark Lance, professor of philosophy and co-director of the Program on Justice and Peace at Georgetown, agreed education has an extremely important influence on authoritarian attitudes. However, he noted that the report’s overall finding on education can be misleading because he believes education’s impact can pull in both directions, based on his experiences as a peace educator. 
“Education, if it’s successful, breeds precisely the kinds of habits and skills that make a populace resist authoritarianism,” Lance said in an interview with The Hoya. “On the other hand, if education is structured around following a bunch of arbitrary rules, and believing what the person in the front of the room tells you, and writing it down and repeating it back on the test, then education reinforces authoritarianism.” 
Lance said these two kinds of education are in perpetual conflict with one another. He said  liberatory education, which is centered on raising consciousness and engagement, runs through the justice and peace studies department, as its mission is to train students to work for social justice and, consequently, against authoritarianism. However, he believes authoritarian forms of education also exist at Georgetown. 
“It’s variable here, like anywhere,” he said. “I teach at probably the extreme end, but I think there’s also a fair bit of training at Georgetown that is trying to make people into competent upper managers of what is essentially an authoritarian system.” 
The report determined that the United States had the strongest positive relationship between college education and lower authoritarian tendencies. But because the surveys administered in the study did not incorporate details about the U.S. education system in particular, one can only speculate as to the cause, according to Smith.
One hypothesis the report suggested is the prevalence of the U.S. liberal arts system, which requires students to develop a more open-minded worldview by thinking critically across multiple disciplines. 
“Liberal arts majors (excluding the sciences) are less inclined toward authoritarianism than those who major in either business-related fields or STEM disciplines,” the report found. “The prevalence of at least some exposure to the liberal arts among US students may help explain why an American higher education in particular is associated with a weak preference for authoritarianism.”
Although the report identified a strong positive relationship between higher education and a disinclination to authoritarianism, it still urged colleges to work even harder against authoritarian attitudes. 
“In the United States, college can and should instill the skills and abilities people need to participate in and protect American democracy,” the report concluded, “including the capacity to resist the trappings of authoritarianism in its many forms.”

excellent synthesis! i do feel that even as a person educated in liberal arts and law, the STEM fields are unfairly maligned by the professor interviewed. STEM learning promotes curiosity, trial and error, and creative design, all of which can propel one to resist authoritarianism and embrace chaotic creativity that leads to solutions from the bottom up rather than the top down

Amid a continuing contractual dispute between Georgetown University’s graduate student union and the administration, the Georgetown University Student Association Senate rallied to support the union’s demands.
The GUSA Senate unanimously passed a resolution at its Oct. 4 meeting calling for the university to recognize the right of the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees to bargain for fall semester work policy changes. GAGE recently announced plans to enter arbitration proceedings with the school, arguing the university violated the union’s contract by refusing to bargain with union leadership over the university’s plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The university formally denied the union’s grievance request Thursday morning, all but certifying arbitration proceedings.
Throughout the summer, GAGE lobbied for guaranteed health and economic protections for graduate workers, entering formal bargaining sessions with the university in July. The bargaining sessions proved fruitless, with the university backing out of negotiations in late August, according to GAGE leadership. 
Senate Speaker Leo Teixeira (COL ’21), who introduced the bill, expressed frustration with the administration’s handling of the dispute with GAGE. 
“It is a tremendous failure on the university’s part to so blatantly disregard these graduate workers’ right to unionize and to engage in collective bargaining,” Teixeira said during the meeting. “This should be regarded as a horrific, horrific deed on their part in any circumstance.”
The resolution will hopefully put pressure on the administration to further negotiate with the union, according to Teixeira, who emphasized the importance of supporting vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I think as advocates who represent the student body, we absolutely should stand in solidarity with GAGE with all Georgetown graduate workers and agree to sign on to this as an official stance of GUSA, as well as to urge and demand the university return to the table and give them this COVID agreement,” Teixeira said.
Senator Dominic Gordon (SFS ’24) also expressed dissatisfaction with how the university handled GAGE’s demands.
“I mean, seriously, 200,000 Americans are dead, people,” Gordon said. “[Graduate workers] are going to have issues with COVID-19. We’re going to have to figure out a way to get around this, and I was actually going to ask: did the university provide any reasoning at all for refusing to negotiate? Because to me it just seems ridiculous. I don’t get why the university would not in good faith negotiate with the graduate union.”
The senate also released demographics on diversity of both the current GUSA Senate and of the candidates for the most recent senate election cycle in a presentation created by the GUSA Election Commission. The demographic breakdown highlighted strong LGBTQ, gender and racial diversity in the senate compared to past years. 
Around 57% of the current senate identified as cisgender female, according to the survey. Close to 29% of the senate identified as cisgender male, and 7.1% of senators identified as non-binary; the remaining percentage provided no response. 
Around 43% of senators identified as straight, while 14.3% identified as gay and 25% identified as bisexual. 
Just over 35% of the senate identified as white, according to the survey. An equal proportion of senators — 17.9% — identified as Black and Asian. Close to 4% of senators identified as American Indian/Alaskan Native, and another 17.9% of senators identified as other. 
The presentation also revealed high levels of socioeconomic diversity. While over half of Georgetown students pay full tuition, only 25% of senators reported paying full tuition. Additionally, nine senators reported being first-generation college students and twelve senators reported being part of the Georgetown Scholarship Program, a program that provides support for first-generation and low-income Georgetown students. 
While applauding the increased senate diversity, Election Commision Chair Varsha Menon (SFS ’21) emphasized the need to maintain diversity and not tokenize it. 
“So just kind of keep that in mind that, like, yes, you have a very diverse senate, which is awesome — like more women than men,” Menon said at the meeting. “You have folks who are gender non-conforming, that’s awesome. But, just being aware of keeping it a space where marginalized people can feel like they can be here.”
Menon also mentioned the recent senate election, noting how several senators dropped out of their races because of concerns about a culture of exclusion in the senate.
“You might be wondering, like this isn’t really my place to say that, but it really is because the culture that you foster in the senate, kind of spills over into elections,” Menon said. “There is a first year who withdrew, and he literally said in his candidacy withdrawal that the senate seems so toxic, that it was not going to be good for his mental health, which is not wonderful. That’s not the kind of vibe that I think you guys should aim for.”

Georgetown University students are calling on the university’s South Asian Society to initiate structural reforms to increase board representation, transparency and inclusivity. 
Georgetown University Students 4 South Asia, an unaffiliated student-led campaign, published a petition April 20 calling on the South Asian Society to change the board selection process to be more accessible and representative of the Georgetown community. The petition has garnered over 100 signatures from Georgetown community members as of April 28.
The changes for which the petition advocates will strengthen the South Asian community on campus and expand the South Asian Society’s reach, according to the petition.
“By actively encouraging greater inclusion of the general body through these key points, we can promote greater representation and facilitate a learning, welcoming environment for all South Asian students at Georgetown University,” the petition reads.
Currently, the SAS board is selected through both a general body vote and interviews conducted by a committee of SAS members, with both processes sharing equal weight. The petition calls for SAS to eliminate board candidate interviews in favor of adhering to a general body vote in line with other cultural clubs on campus to reduce board selection based on personal relationships and increase representation.
Many students involved in drafting the petition have felt culturally excluded while involved with SAS, according to Nirvana Khan (SFS ’24), an active member of the South Asian community at Georgetown and a part of the GUSFSA campaign. 
“A couple weeks ago I started getting very frustrated because I’m from Bangladesh, and I felt like I was really missing the Bengali community at Georgetown,” Khan said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “I thought that the South Asian Society would fill that void for me, but I don’t feel engaged by them at all.”
SAS programming has historically been India-centric and Hindu-centric, including SAS’s flagship event, Rangila, a philanthropic showcase of South Asian dances, according to Khan.
“I was really surprised that they don’t have a Bengali dance at Rangila. There are 12 dances and not one of them is Bengali,” Khan said. “As a Muslim, I definitely don’t feel super included by the fact that there are often lots of recognition of big Indian holidays like Holi, Diwali, Garba, but no recognition of Ramadan or Eid.”
Alongside their petition for structural reform, GUSFSA’s campaign is collecting and publishing anonymous testimonials about social and cultural issues within SAS. Testimonials reference casteism, anti-Black racism and a lack of accountability around sexual assault.
According to an anonymous testimonial, SAS does not sincerely attempt to understand the complexities and dynamics that affect all of South Asia.
“Coming from eastern India, I see little to no representation of my culture, cuisine, practices, or even the realities of what it means to be from somewhere that is NOT Gujarat or Punjab,” the testimonial reads.
SAS recognizes the concerns the testimonials have raised and plans to work to foster inclusivity through changes within the organization, according to SAS President Nethra Viswanathan (SFS ’22).
“Obviously it was very disheartening to see because we want the South Asian Society to be as inclusive and a home for everybody and make sure that it’s a space where everyone feels comfortable,” Vishwanathan said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “We are an imperfect organization, just like every other organization on this campus, and we have tons of work to do in terms of the way that we can be inclusive.”
Following GUSFSA’s advocacy, the SAS board announced reforms in response to the petition during an April 26 town hall aimed at gathering feedback and discussing SAS’s future. The proposed reforms meet some of the petition’s demands, including improved election transparency and greater diversity and representation within the club. However, the board selection process will still require an interview component, according to SAS board members who spoke at the town hall.
The interview prevents board positions from being awarded unfairly and paves a way for minority groups and first-year students to have a more equal chance of being selected, according to Vishwanathan.
“The reason that the interview was created for the SAS board to begin with was because people felt that the general body vote became a popularity contest,” Vishwanathan said at the town hall. “People would vote for their friends, and they wouldn’t reflect on what the community actually wants.”
In response to GUSFA’s criticism, SAS published a new online form for community members to list holidays that are important to them. SAS will use the results to create better cultural representation within the club, according to Vishwanathan. 
“I know that there is so much cultural and religious diversity within South Asia, and we need to do a better job of addressing all of it,” Vishwanathan said in a Zoom interview with the Hoya. 
Although SAS has yet to initiate all of the petition’s reforms, the town hall and proposed reforms to elections and structure are still signs of progress, according to Khan.
“Overall, I believe that the board is trying to do better. I think this is an important stepping stone to our final destination,” Khan said.

After nearly two years, throngs of students returned to Red Square to buy artisan food and support local vendors as part of the Georgetown University Farmers’ Market (GUFM).
GUFM, a student-run not-for-profit organization that promotes sustainable agriculture and supports local businesses, returned to Red Square on Oct. 6 at limited operational status. Local vendors included Timber Pizza Co., a mobile wood oven pizza truck; Yoga in a Bowl, an Indian restaurant; Borek-G, a Turkish restaurant; and Maracas Ice Pops, an ice pops vendor. The Farmers’ Market did not operate last year during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The market’s revival signals the comeback of a beloved campus tradition, according to Irmak Şensöz (SFS ’23). 
“I think the Farmers’ Market was something that most students looked forward to a lot every Wednesday, and so just being able to go again — even if the options are pretty limited — is a sign of returning to normal and what Georgetown was once like pre-pandemic,” Şensöz said in an interview with The Hoya. 
In the past, the Farmers’ Market featured 16 vendors from the Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area, as well as two vendors run by graduates of the Georgetown community. The Farmers’ Market also included 11 pop-up vendors who appeared once during the Farmers’ Market season, which runs during the early fall and late spring.
In past years, the Farmers’ Market has offered a wider range of food options from local vendors, including Ashton Farms, a fruit orchard; Craft Kombucha, a kombucha brewery; Panorama Bakery, an artisan bakery; and DMV Empanadas, a restaurant serving homemade empanadas. 
Tents and limited space in Red Square forced GUFM to scale back the size of the Farmers’ Market, according to GUFM co-director Madeleine O’Hara (SFS ’22).
The Farmers’ Market is enforcing COVID-19 safety measures, including requiring all individuals to be masked while in line, despite university policy allowing fully vaccinated students to not wear masks while outdoors. Vendors are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19, according to O’Hara. 
While the Farmers’ Market is currently offering limited space for vendors, the organization plans to increase its operating status throughout the fall and spring, according to O’Hara. 
“We really just had to kind of give them pretty last-minute notice, so it was whoever wanted to come,” O’Hara said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “We’re also kind of starting with a scaled-back amount of vendors to hopefully ramp it up for the regular market season.” 
Although some students noted high costs and long lines, the Farmers’ Market was a welcome alternative to Leo J. O’Donovan Dining Hall, according to Ella Braunfeld (SFS ’25), who visited the market for the first time Wednesday. 
“I had the Indian chicken rice bowl. It was probably the best $15 I’ve ever spent here at Georgetown,” Braunfeld said in an interview with The Hoya. “It was a bit expensive, but that’s what you get for living in D.C.” 
For Katherine Taulane (COL ’24), despite the long lines, the ability to support local businesses and enjoy the market made it a worthy experience.
“I thought it was really cool,” Taulane said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “I liked the different foods they had, and it’s just nice seeing a lot of students gather together to support these different businesses.” 
The return of the Farmers’ Market signals Georgetown’s openness to giving back to the community, according to O’Hara. 
“Ultimately, it’s just an investment in community, and the university having it back I feel like is a sign that they’re willing to invest in community because they know that it’s important to students,” O’Hara said. 
GUFM also collaborates with other university and student organizations. The Georgetown Renewable Energy Environmental Network helps lead composting services at the event, and GUFM donates to the Georgetown Scholars Program’s grocery stipends program.
The Farmers’ Market is an important way for the Georgetown community to come together and enjoy a break in the week, according to O’Hara. 
“It’s a pause where students can get together with their friends and really enjoy each other’s company, and I think it’s such an important community-building part of Georgetown,” O’Hara said. “Georgetown is a very fast-paced school, and this is a chance for students to slow down and enjoy life and being outside and being with friends and fresh food.” 
Braunfeld plans to return to the Farmers’ Market soon. 
“I would go back next Wednesday and try another stand,” Braunfeld said. “All those stands looked amazing, and I want to try all of them. So that’s my goal for the semester: try all the stands there.”

The Native American Student Council (NASC) called on Georgetown University to issue a land acknowledgment and officially recognize Indigenous Peoples Day.
On Oct. 11, NASC — a student group that advocates for Indigenous community members on campus — hosted an event in Red Square featuring three speakers from the organization. At the event, students demanded that university leadership officially acknowledge the Indigenous land Georgetown sits on, as well as officially recognize Indigenous Peoples Day as a campus holiday, which Georgetown currently calls a mid-semester holiday.
Georgetown’s main campus sits on land that belongs to the Piscataway and Nacotchtank tribes. NASC member Carson Ramírez (COL ’23) said during a speech that the colonial occupation of Indigenous land, both in the Washington, D.C. area and across North America, has led to a loss of Indigenous customs.
“Many customs with using nature and sharing with nature have been lost because of these breaches of land and overtaking of land,” Ramírez said.
The university is neglecting its responsibility to properly acknowledge the Indigenous land campus sits on and pushes a burden onto Native American students and faculty, according to professor of philosophy Shelbi Meissner, one of two Native American faculty members at Georgetown.
“The emotional, spiritual, mental, and physical labor that goes into crafting a meaningful land acknowledgment should not fall solely on the shoulders of Indigenous students or Indigenous faculty,” Meissner wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Not only does Georgetown have an abysmally small number of American Indian students (~10) and faculty (2) that would make shouldering this burden impossible, it’s also the ethical responsibility of those with institutional power and representation to invest in a land acknowledgment.”
The university is exploring programming with local Indigenous tribes, according to a university spokesperson. 
“We deeply respect and are open to engaging with the Piscataway tribe, whose ancestral lands include the District of Columbia. The university is extremely supportive of exploring programming, and course options that share our diversity, equity and inclusion values, and reflect the broad interests of our students,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya.
In addition to the land acknowledgment, NASC demands the university change the name of the Oct. 11 holiday on Georgetown’s calendar from mid-semester holiday to Indigenous Peoples Day to recognize the Indigenous students on campus, according to NASC President Tristin Sam (SFS ’23). 
On Oct. 11, President Joe Biden proclaimed a federal observance of Indigenous Peoples Day, marking the first time a U.S. president has officially recognized the holiday. Sam said the news evoked a flood of emotions. 
“It’s a lot of mixed emotions. It’s a lot of strong feelings,” Sam said in an interview with The Hoya. “It’s both a celebration. It’s both mourning. It’s reverence. It’s a reflection. Overall it’s also an affirmation that we’re here, we survived, and I am a beneficiary of that survival, and all my friends and family have survived, and we are here, and we will be here.”
NASC has also called on the university to put more effort into recruiting Native American students. Native American students only make up approximately 0.1% of the student body, and the Indigenous community on campus lacks academic and cultural resources, according to NASC Vice President Alanna Cronk (COL ’23).
“Georgetown is very uniquely located in a very political place, and this is a school that people go to to become influential political figures, and so we want to make sure that that potential power is also being invested in the hands of Indigenous people,” Cronk said in an interview with The Hoya.
The Georgetown Office of Undergraduate Admissions says it is recruiting students from all backgrounds, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown is committed to multicultural recruitment and supports prospective students from diverse backgrounds and geographic regions, including Native American students, throughout the recruitment and application process,” the spokesperson wrote.
Regardless of the university’s response, the NASC’s celebration of Indigenous Peoples Day marks a celebration of Indigenous land, culture and activism, according to Cronk.
“I think symbolically it’s important to do something just on Indigenous Peoples Day, even if not a single person came,” Cronk said. “To be on this land, and say the words that we did, I think is significant in itself.”

Cynthia Chavez Lamar will become the first Indigenous woman to serve as the director of a Smithsonian museum when she assumes the role at the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) on Feb. 14.
Chavez Lamar is a member of San Felipe Pueblo and also has Hopi, Tewa and Navajo lineage. While the museum’s past two directors have been Indigenous, Chavez Lamar is the first Indigenous woman appointed to the role. Chavez Lamar currently serves as the museum’s acting associate director for collections and operations, a role she has held since January 2021.
The Hoya sat down with Chavez Lamar on Jan. 26 to discuss what the role means to her, what she hopes to do as director and how she will use her position to spotlight Indigenous communities. 
According to Chavez Lamar, the outpouring of support from past coworkers and the idea of inspiring others to see themselves in positions like hers has been rewarding.
“I’ve felt really, really supported throughout this time because I’ve received so many messages of support from a lot of different people,” Chavez Lamar told The Hoya. “Some of those have included former staff members that I’ve worked with, interns that I’ve worked with, and it has made me feel really good to know that they do see this particular situation that I’m in as inspiring for them, in terms of that it could possibly be them in this position in the future.”
The Smithsonian Institution announced Chavez Lamar’s appointment Jan. 19 after Kevin Gover, who previously served as the museum’s director, became the Smithsonian’s under secretary for museums and culture in January 2021.
Chavez Lamar’s appointment comes as a part of a broader movement to include Indigenous voices in museum work, according to Lonnie Bunch, secretary of the Smithsonian, in a Jan. 19 press release.
“Dr. Chavez Lamar is at the forefront of a growing wave of Native American career museum professionals,” Burch wrote in the press release. “They have played an important role in changing how museums think about their obligations to Native communities and to all communities.” 
Chavez Lamar’s research interests include Southwest Native art and the methodologies and practices involved in collaborating with individual Indigenous communities, according to the press release.
Chavez said her family in New Mexico inspired her future academic interest in Indigenous art and culture.
“Growing up in a family with an artist really influenced me when I was young,” Chavez Lamar said. “And of course, my family participated in art markets, they knew artists, so it was just really a big part of my life.”
Prior to her renewed tenure at NMAI in 2014, Chavez Lamar was an intern in 1994 and served as an associate curator from 2000 to 2005 at NMAI.
According to Chavez Lamar, her experiences working at NMAI in the early 2000s helped shape her conduct when working with Indigenous communities.
“NMAI is where I learned the practices and ethical principles of collaboration with Indigenous people,” Chavez Lamar said. “That was really ingrained in me when I was at NMAI, and when I left NMAI, that was very much a part of the way that I continued to work with Indigenous people.”
Chavez Lamar also served as the director of the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center in Albuquerque, N.M., following her departure from NMAI in 2006 before becoming the director of the Indian Arts Research Center at the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe, N.M., in 2007, a position she held until returning to NMAI in 2014 to serve as assistant director for collections. 
One of the priorities throughout her tenure as director of NMAI will be continuing collaborations with Indigenous groups and spotlighting Indigenous communities, according to Chavez Lamar.
“I have a deep commitment to collaboration and partnership with Indigenous people,” Chavez Lamar told The Hoya. “I know that the museum as a whole has historically, up into the present day, has had that commitment, so I’ll continue to emphasize that.”
Assuming a position of this magnitude is a challenge, but it is one Chavez Lamar is determined to meet.
“It still really hasn’t completely sunk in that I’m going to be the director of the National Museum of American Indian, and I think that sort of the enormity of it has not really fully hit me yet,” Chavez Lamar said. “If anything, I really want to be able to continue to support the excellent work of the staff so that we can amplify Indigenous perspectives and voices through the educational offerings of the museum.”

CW: This article directly references racist statements made on social media. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
The Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) placed Ilya Shapiro on administrative leave and will investigate his actions following racist and sexist tweets. 
Shapiro, who was set to become executive director of the Georgetown Center for the Constitution on Feb. 1, posted tweets expressing his opposition to President Biden’s pledge to nominate the first Black female Supreme Court justice. Shapiro wrote that the nominee would be a “lesser black woman.” Shapiro deleted the original posts and tweeted an apology, in which he called his original words “inartful,” on Jan. 27, before posting a tweet Jan. 31 expressing his confidence that he will be vindicated and begin his new position at the university shortly. 
In a series of tweets posted on Jan. 26, Shapiro made racist comments about Black female lawyers and perpetuated harmful sentiments using the model minority myth, which opponents of the Civil Rights Movement created to justify racism against Black community by using the Asian Americans as a driving wedge. 
“Objectively best pick for Biden is Sri Srinivasan, who is solid prog & v smart. Even has identity politics benefit of being first Asian (Indian) American,” Shapiro wrote in one of the now-deleted tweets. “But alas doesn’t fit into latest intersectionality hierarchy so we’ll get lesser black woman.” 
Shapiro’s statement that Black female lawyers are not worthy of serving on the Supreme Court made students, like Drea Shropshire (LAW ’24), feel invisible. 
“I don’t think that people who make comments like that even recognize how much of a miracle it is for students like me — who are first generation, who are Black and who are women — to even make it to a space to attend law school and to even have the confidence and support to make it through and finish that process,” Shropshire said in an interview with The Hoya. “It makes me feel like despite how hard I’ve worked to get myself here, I often find myself feeling imposter syndrome.”  
Shapiro did not respond to The Hoya’s multiple requests for comment. 
During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden committed to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court. Justice Stephen Breyer announced plans to retire Jan. 26, leaving an open Supreme Court seat for President Biden to fill; it was this news that prompted Shapiro’s Jan. 26 tweet.
William Treanor, dean of GULC, emailed GULC community members Jan. 27 condemning Shapiro’s words. Following outrage expressed by community members, including a Jan. 28 statement released by the Georgetown Law Black Law Student Association (Georgetown BLSA), Treanor announced Jan. 31 that Shapiro has been placed on administrative leave and will be investigated in accordance with university policies.
In the statement, Georgetown BLSA urges GULC to rescind Shapiro’s job offer, commit to a more thorough hiring process, properly staff the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, ensure the representation of Black students when it comes to hiring decisions and fund an endowment to support Black GULC students. The statement has garnered over 1,000 electronic signatures as of Feb. 1. 
Georgetown BLSA immediately began drafting the statement following Shapiro’s tweets, according to Deon McCray (LAW ’22), president of Georgetown’s BLSA chapter.  
“Our community really was instantly outraged after the tweet. And even more importantly the belief and the stance that the tweet represents,” McCray said in an interview with The Hoya. 
When asked for a comment, a GULC spokesperson said they cannot comment on “personnel matters” and referred The Hoya to Treanor’s Jan. 31 email.  
Students of color at GULC continuously face racist comments from professors, faculty or staff, McCray said. 
“One of our big responses really was, in a few words, ‘here we go again, here we go again,’” McCray said. “This is my third year on our executive board, and this is the third time I’ve been a part of a process like this.” 
This is not the first time Shapiro has expressed racist sentiments toward Supreme Court nominees. In a 2009 opinion piece he wrote for CNN after President Barack Obama’s nomination of current justice Sonia Sotomayor, Shapiro said she would not have been picked if she were not Hispanic. 
Last year, Sandra Sellers, an adjunct professor at GULC at the time, complained about the academic performance of her Black students in a video shared via Twitter on March 10. GULC terminated Sellers following the incident and student backlash. 
Kalli Joslin (LAW ’22) said that Sellers’s — and now Shapiro’s — comments point to deeply institutionalized racism at GULC. 
“I worry that there are a lot of faculty members that secretly harbor very similar opinions and beliefs about their Black female students and fellow faculty members and just aren’t saying them out loud,” Joslin said in an interview with The Hoya. “The fact that these similar events have happened in the last year shows that these aren’t isolated incidents.” 
Lauren Harris (LAW ’22), who signed BLSA’s petition, said she was not surprised by Shapiro’s racist tweet. 
“Unfortunately, I have come to expect situations like this, and Georgetown is no different,” Harris said in an interview with The Hoya. “So I won’t say that I am let down. I will say that is on par with a lot of experiences that I have had in my career personally and professionally. And the expectation, again, as a leader in the legal industry of the nation’s capital is to do better.” 
Furthermore, Treanor’s Jan. 27 email did not adequately address the magnitude of the tweet, according to Harris. 
“It seemed to separate the act from the actor, and the language that was used about the tweets, having discriminatory language, and it completely removed the act from the actor,” Harris said.  “That just kind of told to a lack of accountability and a lack of awareness.” 
Anti-Black racism is historically common in the field of law, Harris said. 
“There is anti-Black racism running rampant everywhere,” Harris said. “When you go into sectors such as law, which has historically been white male-dominated, it is going to be a pattern until we get down to accountability and I think accountability goes beyond losing a job or firing somebody.” 
Despite making up 13.4% of the population, Black individuals make up only 5% of all lawyers in the United States, and that percentage has not increased in the last decade.
Rujuta Nandgaonkar (LAW ’22) said it is unacceptable that Shapiro’s tweets pitted Asian Americans and Black Americans against one another. 
“I unequivocally reject this division that he fomented, especially between my affiliated community and the Black community, but especially Black women,” Nandgaonkar said in an interview with The Hoya. “Our fellow staff members, our classmates, our colleagues fully deserve their places in our legal community, and that’s from Georgetown Law all the way to the Supreme Court.”
Division between communities of color harms the fight for racial justice by perpetuating the incorrect belief that systematic racism can be overcome by individual effort, especially the effort of one group over another. 
The National Black Law Students Association (NBLSA) stands in solidarity with the Georgetown BLSA, according to a statement written by NBLSA National Chair Simone Yhap and Vice-Chair Richard Garzola. 
“Mr. Ilya Shapiro’s abhorrent tweets regarding Black women being ‘lesser’ were not only denigrating, but also a direct reflection of the ingrained racism within the legal profession,” the statement to The Hoya reads. 
The university’s inadequate response to Shapiro’s tweets makes it difficult for Shropshire to trust that GULC will be a good experience for other aspiring lawyers.
“When I’m talking to other prospective Black law students, it’s really difficult to encourage them to come to the school that I attend because of these egregious comments that are made about Black people,” Shropshire said. “It’s hard for me to encourage Black people to put themselves in a situation that could cause them emotional trauma.”  
The university must rescind Shapiro’s employment offer, according to Shropshire. 
“If they let him skate by considering the circumstances, that sends a message to students, to professors, to the general public of what the university is going to tolerate and that they would essentially be sweeping racism under the rug,” Shropshire said. “I can’t defend that.”

This is pathetic journalism. Rather than accurately reporting that some people interpreted the tweets as racist, the whole article, supposedly straight news, pronounces them as definitively racist — as if that is a FACT not in question, rather than a subject of dispute. As a multi-award winning professional journalist and longtime, recognized fighter against white supremacists, and as former holder of six different editor positions for The HOYA, I am embarrassed by this example of biased (not to mention highly overwrought) “journalism.” It is not up to the standards The HOYA once held, and which it should exemplify still.

The Georgetown Entrepreneurship Initiative welcomed three new entrepreneurs-in-residence (EIRs) to its industry mentorship program as part of its twelfth cohort. 
The Entrepreneurship Initiative at the McDonough School of Business (MSB) provides students with opportunities to learn about entrepreneurship and apply those skills through pitch competitions and events with distinguished visiting speakers. The new EIRs are Karima Ladhani, David Goldberg (GRD ’94) and Nkechi “Payton” Iheme, all of whom will advise and mentor students, alumni, faculty and administrators in the Georgetown community.  
The EIRs’ diverse expertise is a valuable resource to the Georgetown community, according to David Lange, the initiative’s program manager. 
“We have assembled a team of incredible entrepreneurs from a wide variety of backgrounds and industry experiences who together have combined experience of hundreds of years spanning everything from health to tech to finance to real estate to consumer packaged goods,” Lange said in an interview with The Hoya. “They are here to help our students with any questions that they may have.” 
Students can connect with EIRs by attending weekly Chalk Talks or by browsing through entrepreneur biographies and messaging directly through the initiative’s website, Lange said. 
Ladhani is the founder and chief executive officer of Barakat Bundle, a nonprofit that works to provide health and education packages to mothers and newborns in South Asia. Although it primarily partners with communities in India, Barakat Bundle also has a branch called Giving Cradle, which sells cribs in North America to expand the organization’s market. 
Ladhani developed Barakat Bundle when she was a student and encourages students to take advantage of the resources available to them in college. 
“Knowing how to leverage those opportunities is really important, and as an entrepreneur, you don’t know what you don’t know,” Ladhani said in an interview with The Hoya. “As an entrepreneur-in-residence, I hope I can shed some light on those things that students may not even know to ask about or have the foresight to see. Hopefully that can allow them to be even more prepared as they move forward with their ventures or ideas.”
Ladhani’s goal as an EIR is to advise each individual student with entrepreneurship projects that they are passionate about. 
“My role as an entrepreneur-in-residence is in many ways directed by students. I’m here to be able to advise students on thinking through the ideas they may have to solve a particular problem, whether that is creating a startup or facing a community-based challenge,” Ladhani said. “We’re here to be able to provide advice based on our experience.”
Iheme is the head of public policy for North America, Latin America and the Caribbean for Bumble Inc., a social network for dating, looking for friends or growing one’s professional network, and will also serve as a new EIR. 
Goldberg, who has leadership experience in the education, hospitality and franchise industries, recently retired from his position as president, chief executive officer and board member of Cadence Education, the fourth largest provider of early childhood education in the nation. 
The scope and convenience of the EIR program for aspiring entrepreneurs is a testament to Georgetown’s prominence in education, according to Goldberg. 
“In my short time with the program, I have been incredibly impressed with the faculty, the entrepreneurs-in-residence that I have met, and the program itself, which is incredibly well-organized, expansive and accessible,” Goldberg wrote to The Hoya. “This is an incredible resource for students and alumni of smart, experienced, dedicated people who are giving their time and expertise back to the Georgetown community. It’s a great example of what makes Georgetown such a special place.”
Mike Malloy, who is in his seventh year as an EIR, said that EIRs play an important role in assisting students with entrepreneurial research and implementation of ideas. 
“EIRs give students advice on how to navigate the lean startup methodology to bring their ideas to reality,” Malloy wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We help students identify hypotheses about the problems they wish to solve, and then encourage them to conduct customer discovery interviews to (in)validate their hypothesis. We also help students pitch and present their ideas.”
Goldberg aspires to support students as they realize the potential of a variety of entrepreneurial opportunities. 
“The most important skill for young people to develop is the skill in being able to ‘figure it out’, which means finding a way to solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity – through research, seeing advice from the right people, trial and error, or just being persistent,” Goldberg wrote in an email to The Hoya.

The Muslim Law Students Association (MLSA) wrote a letter Feb. 28 to Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) administrators calling for action to address one professor’s racist and Islamophobic class conduct.  
The letter — which has garnered signatures from 286 Georgetown students, almost 30 student organizations and 24 non-GULC bar associations as of March 3 — asks for increased administrative representation and curriculum changes. The letter describes discriminatory conduct toward Muslim students by Susan Deller Ross, a tenured professor who teaches courses in international and comparative law on women’s human rights and is the director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic. 
The authors of the letter, which were a group of MLSA members, gathered information from decades of coursework in Ross’ classes, citing dozens of excerpts from the required textbook she authored and exam questions she wrote. The authors wrote that the content they gathered represents a holistic picture of Ross’ racist and Islamophobic beliefs. 
The letter requests that Ross’ course curriculum be modified and reviewed by a Muslim expert, according to Hamsa Fayed (LAW ’23), a member of MLSA.
“It is quite clear from our 17-page memo and content of our statement that Prof. Ross is not able to objectively evaluate any question relating to Muslims and their practice without injecting dangerously Islamophobic rhetoric into her teachings/examinations, thus we also ask that she refrain from the use of those topics in her class lectures and examinations,” Fayed wrote to The Hoya.
MLSA’s demands include mandating anti-Islamophobia and anti-discrimination specific training for all GULC faculty, reserving a seat for an MLSA representative on the committee that appoints GULC faculty, and creating a clear and direct internal system for students to anonymously file complaints for the administration to investigate.
Past coursework that MLSA marked as promoting islamophobic rhetoric included a 2020 exam that asked students to advocate for the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), an extremist right-wing party responsible for mass lynchings of Muslims in India and Kashmir. 
The exam question distressed and harmed many students, according to MLSA member Maheen Haq (LAW ’23).
“How do you expect someone like a Muslim person to take that exam?” Haq said in an interview with The Hoya. “Members of my family have died and you’d be expected to take this exam and advocate on behalf of a party that has done lynchings of your community.”
Ross said her coursework does not specifically target Muslim students and focuses on international and human rights law.
“My courses and casebook sections concerning discrimination against women in marriage,
divorce, and inheritance cover many statutes, whether they stem from the Catholic, Protestant, 
Mormon, Jewish, Muslim, or Hindu religion or from ethnic customs or from cultural beliefs that 
women should be subordinate to men,” Ross wrote to The Hoya. “I am not against any religion or ethnicity.”
Being forced to argue on behalf of Islamophobic laws and rules, as the letter states Ross encourages students to do in the clinic, could cause students to begin applying those ideas to their careers and lives, Haq said.  
“This will influence your policy choices, it’s going to influence how you do so many different things,” Haq said. “For example, she asked students to advocate against the right for women to wear a hijab, and she taught students how to use international doctrines and treaties to make that argument. That’s just sick.”
Fayed felt as though she had to act against her beliefs and morals in order to perform well in Ross’ clinic, according to a video posted on the GULC MLSA instagram page.
“This all really tore me apart after a while especially since a lot of those stances were fundamentally against my belief systems and my identity as a human rights advocate,” Fayed said in the video. “I was ashamed of myself, ashamed to call myself an advocate for social justice, ashamed to be a Muslim, ashamed that I wasn’t defending myself as a proud Muslim, ashamed of what I had enabled from being silent, ashamed that I feared speaking out because I was the only one in the room that felt this way, ashamed that those fellow students would invalidate me because I was a nobody in comparison to the decorated and accomplished professor Susan Ross.”  
Jinan Chehade (LAW ’23), another member of MLSA who raised concerns about Ross’ insensitive course content alongside Haq, said the administration did not provide an adequate response.
GULC prioritizes making classrooms inclusive environments with respectful dialogue, according to William Treanor, dean of GULC.
“We received the letter and have been in touch with the student leaders and individuals involved,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown Law is committed to ensuring an inclusive campus that welcomes students of all backgrounds.”
MLSA’s letter follows a series of student activism against racist conduct from faculty members at GULC. The GULC administration placed Ilya Shapiro, a prospective administrator, on administrative leave Jan. 31 pending investigation from the Law Center following racist and sexist tweets about President Biden’s pledge to nominate the first Black female Supreme Court justice. The decision followed a Jan. 28 statement released by the Georgetown Law Black Law Student Association (Georgetown BLSA), urging GULC to to rescind Shapiro’s job offer, commit to a more thorough hiring process, properly staff the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, ensure the representation of Black students when it comes to hiring decisions and fund an endowment to support Black GULC students. 
Professor Franz Werro referred to a student Feb. 10 using an anti-Asian slur, prompting the GULC Asian Pacific American Law Students Association (APALSA) and the Georgetown China Law Society (GCLS) to urge the GULC to hold mandatory implicit bias training for professors and to discipline staff and faculty. In March 2021, Black students and faculty at GULC demanded institutional change after a viral video captured professor Sandra Sellers making racist comments about Black students in her course.
In light of recent controversies at GULC, as well as Ross’ course and clinic, some members of MLSA ask that Islam be taught within accurate and objective contexts at GULC, according to Fayed.
“We want her course curriculums to be modified to be more sensitive to POC cultures and the Islamic faith through the use of a Muslim expert to review the curriculum,” Fayed wrote.
Haq said she ultimately decided to forfeit the opportunity to learn in a clinic she is interested in because of the racism she found in Ross’ curriculum. According to Haq, she is not the only Muslim student who was hesitant to participate in Ross’ course or clinic.  
Nearly 50% of Muslims living in the United States experienced some form of discrimination in the past year, including being treated with suspicion, called offensive names and singled out by law enforcement, according to 2017 data from the Pew Research Center. 
MLSA’s letter also demands that Ross’ grading systems change so that personal biases cannot influence student grades, according to Fayed.
“What we are asking for is simple: removing Prof. Ross from any student evaluation position where her biases and prejudices would negatively affect POC and Muslim students,” Fayed wrote. “The non-blinding grading system does not protect POC and Muslim students at all from Prof. Ross’s inherent prejudices and racism.”
Chehade said that the Islamophobic tactics Ross uses in her curriculum would result in further discrimination if left unchecked by the university.
“It really starts here in the classroom, when we continue to be silent about these blatant forms of racism, when we continue to be passive and say, ‘This is normal,’” Chehade said.

I happen to know Professor Ross and know she’s absolutely against bigotry & religious intolerance. When Trump was running for office and proposed the Muslim ban she was horrified. She’s against practices that subjugate & harm women. That’s her passion. Not hatred. The students go speak with her directly about what they see as bias, discuss how they see the issues, and both parties can try to better understand each other. It’s cruel to paint her in this light, as she’s spent her long career trying to better the lives of many people, Muslims included.

“Students leads charge against female professor (and director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic) for teaching women’s rights material” is  playing differently in the campus press than one would have imagined. 
Of course anyone who was offended by the way Professor Ross teaches her class should be heard. I hope this professor takes this feedback in good faith and reassesses whether she is presenting culturally sensitive material in a sophisticated way.
But of course, the men who run Georgetown should stand up for the right of an accomplished feminist professors to speak about women’s rights, and ignore this outrageous demand to submit her writings to the approval of religious authorities.
And, setting subjective experiences for the moment, the rest of this complaint is absurd. Any decent law student should be able to see through it.
The supposedly offensive exam questions? They’re all extremely normal legal case questions, in which students are challenged to explain how they would represent a particular client taking a particular stand on a women’s rights issue. Yes, some of these stands are controversial, like the French ban on wearing religious dress in classrooms. But don’t Georgetown Law students realize that, as aspiring lawyers, they may need to represent clients who hold controversial positions, even some they may not agree with? Don’t they understand that learning how to do that is … the point of law school? 
The answer, I think, is that they do understand, but they are trying to make mountains out of molehills to tar a professor who (understandably) rubbed them the wrong way by loudly and unapologetically standing up for women’s rights around the world. They’re entitled to their discomfort, but if they don’t recognize the regressive precedent they are trying to set, I hope Georgetown Law leadership does.

This sounds like a personal attack by Haq and Fayed. Do they really think anywhere in America that a university is going to submit a syllabus to a “Muslim expert” for review before teaching. I you think that is going to happen, then GULC or for than matter any American University is not for them. In addition to the separation of church and state there is a concept called academic freedom that allows professors to address issues that are of consequence, and that does includes religions. Religious wars have been the most heinous events in history, murdering people in untold numbers for some infraction against the belief. And its not just wars, it is the day to day religious oppression of those who choose not to comply or voice an opposition. If Haq and Fayed don’t think that is a subject they can intellectually discuss, then perhaps they either don’t have the intellectual capacity to engage in debate, or they are themselves such zealots demanding ‘their rights’ be accommodated they do not belong in the legal profession. GULC has a diversity of students wanting to become lawyers. If Haq and Fayed cannot articulate a position that shows where Ross is violating a law in her teachings, then perhaps they are not suited to the legal profession. I certainly wouldn’t want to find out a lawyer I’ve  hired to defend me would let religion or anything else stand the way of a full throated defense. 
This foolish complaint should be dismissed. And if the complainants are not satisfied, perhaps they should be as well.

No aspect of the comments in support of the professor make sense.  Here is an example of why. According to Donald Trump, those persons — especially Blacks who accused him of being a racist — were the real racists.  Those who supported him not only agreed, but also supported and defended Trump.  Who were these persons?  Many were white nationalists.
I believe the students.  First, Muslims in professional school tend to aspire to just fit in, integrate into their academic settings, and avoid virtually anything that would bring attention to them.  They usually quietly endure institutional insults and encourage other to do the same.  They endure harms. They don’t raise controversy.  Rarely will they respond with demands, sans instances when they seek to address a material harm. 
Second, the professor’s assignments are both unusual and unbalancing. A core principal of legal training is teach a student to, “argue both sides”.  This is not just the practice of law school, but also one of its mandates.  Related, for examination and papers, students are asked to weigh the merits of both side and reach a conclusion. These exercises can be fun because they stimulate debate and students’ knowledge of a subject matter. 
Never, not ever should a law professor instruct a student to argue against the religious or cultural practices of a people — especially if those persons are either Muslim or Jewish.  To do so is an abjectly racist practice.  For certain, the exercise itself is intended to cause harm.
The student’s response was moderated. They expressed their harm and, “proffered” an occasion for Susan Ross, and indeed GT Law, to make amends.  I especially applaud their efforts because, even after being harmed, they only sought that their law school fix things going forward.  
Georgetown U Law is now at a place where it can right a wrong.  It should suspend Ross from teaching.  It may seek to get her placed at a law school in Israel. There, her anti-Muslim speech and practices will be received without controversy.  Or they can encourage her affiliated research and advocacy organisations to fire her.
The law should also undergo changes in its hiring practices.  It should encourage younger Muslim lawyers to teach at the school.  This may lead to the law school fixing the racist biases threat seem to have overwhelmed its Muslim (and, likely other) student populations.  It may also result in GT law benefitting. At a minimum, its students would learn how to argue both sides.
Having evidence of Ross’ decade long patterns of harming and speaking against the cultural and religious practices of Muslims, Georgetown need only do the right thing this time around.   Have her to step down from ever teaching students again.

Ross is a bigot in many ways.  I took her clinic in 1995 before she published her book and she took her stress out on us … esp. me.  The year before she took a year to grade a paper and look up every single footnote.  I am disabled and have an invisible disability and she told me I was “faking it.”  She even shoved me in court .. I should have had her arrested.  She never finished my recommendations, then denied my entrance to a fellowship.  Ross uses feminism to advance herself only and cares nothing about individual women or students.  She’s a terror and a nightmare and it’s a shame her reign is allowed to continue.  She is, quite simply, a terrible human being.

My post was removed.  I had Deller Ross in two classes in 94 and 95 – both were still horror stories engrained on my mind, even now.  I wrote a beautiful long paper on immigration guidelines in the US based on gender persecution and Ross tried to tear it apart – after waiting to grade it for almost a year – and her incomplete – due to her inability to grade – cost me a job offer.  Then in her clinic, she drug me all year asking me to do all kinds of extra work because I was disabled – holding my grade over my head to blackmail me to do it.  She even shoved me in court, and told me my disability was something that I was “faking.”  I should have had her arrested for assault AND filed a complaint for gender/disability bias.  Don’t be fooled by her.  She uses feminism to advance her own career while she rapes the minds and spirits of students who are different than she is – and fawns over a few select favorites.  She falls back on the notion that she is “tenured.”  I am not muslim and I would characterize her as a bigot against the disabled as well as in general an intolerant person.  She is a self-aggrandizer and creates a lot of harm in her ability to broadcast her name in the supposed “help” she has done for other women.  I would guess she has done more harm than good.  I congratulate the student above for having the nerve to speak out.  Ross is a nightmare and I am sorry to hear her reign of terror continues.  She absolutely destroyed my time at Georgetown, never got my recommendations out – and then denied me a fellowship. I have gone on to practice and was even a judge, but still carry her scars.

More than 240 students have signed on to a petition urging Georgetown University to expand South Asia-related curricula and institutional support.   
The petition calls on the university to increase its offerings of South Asian languages, South Asia-related courses and university sponsored academic programming. The petition, which was written by Nikash Harapanahalli (SFS ’24), Suhani Garg (SFS ’23) and Shevani Tewari (SFS ’24), also calls on the university to hire more faculty members who are experts in the region of South Asia. 
South Asian students deserve the opportunity to study their diverse heritage at Georgetown, the petition says.  
“Academic discussions about South Asia must reflect this innate diversity of the region and its people,” the petition reads. 
The university currently offers 14 languages that students can pursue as a major or minor, none of which are South Asian. Next fall, students can take coursework in Sanskrit and seven Hindi classes, according to the fall 2022 class schedule.   
Despite South Asia being home to hundreds of languages, the university has failed to expand offerings to include South Asian languages, Harapanahalli said.    
“South Asia has over 650 languages. It has every single major world religion. It has a history stretching back to the first civilizations. Yet at the best institution for international relations, there is almost nothing for a structured and long-term degree program or certificate program,” Harapanahalli told The Hoya. “My freshman fall, there were no South Asian languages offered.”
According to the MyAccess records of the fall 2020 course offerings for undergraduate students, Georgetown did not offer any South Asian language courses.   
Professor C. Christine Fair, who was the first professor to sign the petition, said this effort is a step in the right direction.
“This is the first real show of force among our students, the first and most significant push towards the university leadership,” Fair told The Hoya. “I’m here to support it. I’ll do everything I can to support these students.” 
However, Fair said language expansion efforts can be complex and costly, requiring student commitment to enroll from the introductory level until reaching proficiency. 
“We have an obligation to get those who want proficiency to proficiency, and you can see how that’s a geometric expansion of manpower with each additional year,” Fair said. “To get the university to invest in that commitment, we need students who are going to vote with their feet and take those classes.”
The petition also calls for the creation of an interdisciplinary academic program that would focus on all of South Asia. This program, according to the petition, should replace Georgetown’s “India Initiative” which only advances research and teaching around India with relation to global affairs.
Georgetown is committed to exploring course options that reflect the broad interests of students, according to a university spokesperson. 
“Georgetown thrives by sharing our extraordinary range of life experiences and learning from our differences, and is committed to making sure that campus programs and services respond to the needs of all students,” the spokesperson wrote to The Hoya.
The university is working to increase South Asian course offerings, as well as creating a more diverse faculty, according to the spokesperson. 
“Our Asian Studies program recognizes the need to deepen engagement with the South Asia region and is actively working on efforts to expand our course offerings, convenings and opportunities to understand the critical importance of South Asia to global affairs,” the spokesperson wrote. 
Professor Shareen Joshi, an India and South Asia scholar, said the petition will show the university how much student support there is for South Asian studies.  
“At Georgetown, if you want to see a new curriculum and you want to see change, you can certainly have your voice heard,” Joshi told The Hoya. 
Harapanahalli said it was meaningful to see so much support from students and faculty for South Asian studies. 
“Seeing faculty support means that there are people in our community that want to see this happen, that want to see South Asia and South Asian dignity honored, that want to see the vibrancy of this subcontinent — home for our parents and for hundreds of students here at Georgetown — being meaningfully studied and discussed,” Harapanahalli said. “The petition would have allowed us to show that our community, whether you’re South Asian or not, deserves better.”
Joshi said the student and faculty support is there, and that the university has the resources to make this change. 
“We have the expertise, we have pretty much everything we need to do this,” Joshi said. “When the will is there, I believe it will happen.”

A team of students from Georgetown University and Harvard University won first place at the 2022 Georgetown Undergraduate Entrepreneurship Challenge for their software company Mercor.
Brendan Foody (MSB ’25), Surya Midha (SFS ’25) and Adarsh Hiremath, a first-year at Harvard, co-founded Mercor in January 2022. The company pairs teams of skilled engineers with start-ups to meet their development needs. 
The trio, all of whom attended the same high school in San Jose, Calif., were awarded a $10,000 prize for being chosen out of 60 teams to win the April 7 Entrepreneurship Challenge, Georgetown’s largest annual pitch competition. 
Mercor is the first business to combine software contracting and software recruiting, which is attractive to small start-ups that want to simultaneously grow their product and their team, Foody said. 
“The reason that’s really uniquely strategic in the start-up market is because start-ups need their team in-house as they’re iterating their product, growing, and raising venture cash,” Foody said in an interview with The Hoya. “We’re the only software contractor that allows them the predictability and efficiency associated with contracting but also gives them the option to have their team in-house as they grow.”
Undergraduate and graduate students at Georgetown were able to pitch their ideas in the Entrepreneurship Challenge, with competitors giving a five-minute pitch followed by a three-minute question-and-answer session from a panel of judges. The Entrepreneurship Challenge awards separate winners for the undergraduate and graduate levels. 
Hiremath said that as a dual recruiting and contracting agency, Mercor works to source tech talent through top Indian Institutes of Technology and then applies their skill sets to specific start-up projects. 
“Say they want to build an application or website, or they even want a minor tweak to their existing codebase. They would come to Mercor, and Mercor would use that talent to do high quality work at an affordable price,” Hiremath told The Hoya. “One of the things that Mercor is currently focused on doing is building out our platform where entrepreneurs can go on the platform and then be matched with an engineering team of the appropriate skill set.” 
Mercor plans to sponsor a hackathon at IIT Kharagpur, a top computer science college in India on April 27. 
The coding club at IIT Kharagpur invited students from a variety of Indian Institutes of Technology to compete in the hackathon for the opportunity to work at Mercor, Hiremath said.
“There are 500 participants in the competition, and they’re all competing for an opportunity to work at Mercor and work on the software products that we have for clients,” Hiremath said. “We believe that sourcing talent early is one of the best ways possible to get that talent, and we’re doing that by partnering with IITs.” 
Mercor has seen success with clients at Georgetown University and beyond, like Pentada, a platform for finance and commerce apps. Additionally, the company built the dashboard and QR code for Attend, an app that allows professors to create a QR code that a student can scan to log their class attendance. 
Recently, Mercor partnered with Chris Delaney (MSB ’25) on his project, Hoyadle, a spin-off of the popular online game Wordle.
Delaney said that Foody’s work at Mercor helped to turn his code for Hoyadle into a reality. 
“As soon as I told him about it, he was able to access the domain for me to get access and upload the code to the website and run it within a few hours,” Delaney said in an interview with The Hoya. “Most of what he developed was making the website actually real and putting the website to the domain, and he also helped with marketing by advertising it on Instagram and reaching out to some other Georgetown related accounts to advertise for us.”
In the future, Mercor hopes to partner with venture capital firms to receive referrals for early stage investments. By working with venture capital firms, Mercor can ensure that their business endeavors involve companies with sufficient levels of capital to be successful, Foody said. 
To meet increased demand for software contracting and development, Mercor must continue to develop its new platforms to scale.  
“For us, as co-founders, the thing we want to improve on is making sure we have a very rigorous, scalable process to manage a ton of projects concurrently,” Hiremath said. “Because, ultimately, the way we take Mercor to the next level is by efficiently managing all of those components. That’s one of our biggest priorities.”

Rangila, Georgetown University’s annual, student-run philanthropic showcase of South Asian dance, returned in person to Gaston Hall following a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Following months of preparation, nearly 350 students gathered to perform an array of South Asian dances to a sold-out Gaston Hall on April 22 and 23, raising at least $20,000 for charity. “Rangila” is Hindi for “color,” a reference to the colorful costumes that dancers wear as they perform dances from countries including India and Sri Lanka. 
This year’s show was themed “Revive,” a reference to Rangila’s in-person return following pandemic-related delays. 
The name alluded to how this year, Rangila focused on rebuilding internal knowledge of the tradition among students and organizers, according to Rangila co-Coordinator Sanjana Malla (COL ’22). 
“For this Rangila, the main purpose of it was to bring Rangila out of its two-year hiatus and reset that institutional memory, which I don’t think previous Rangilas had to do,” Malla told The Hoya. “We did revive Rangila back to the same height that it was.”
Because the class of 2022 was the only remaining class that had helped organize Rangila in the past, there was a risk that if Rangila did not happen this year, no one would know how to organize it in the future, according to Syona Hariharan (SFS ’22), one of Rangila’s three coordinators.
“The stakes were high,” Hariharan told The Hoya. “It was a challenge for us because there was no institutional knowledge.” 
The relative lack of institutional knowledge among the organizers was also reflected among Georgetown’s broader community. Typically, around 700 students sign up for about 350 existing spots, Hariharan said. This year, only around 400 students signed up, which was likely because fewer Georgetown students knew about Rangila this year than in previous years, according to Hariharan. 
For many months, it looked like Rangila would not happen this year at all, according to Hariharan. Because of the pandemic, Hariharan said holding Rangila in the fall, when the show is typically held, was not possible, and it wasn’t until mid-January that Georgetown’s South Asian Society, which oversees Rangila, found out that the showcase could take place in April. 
That condensed a typical preparation period of about seven months into only three months, but Hariharan said it was all worth it. 
“That might have been the coolest thing I’ve ever done. I’m really proud of the work we did to bring it back,” Hariharan said. “I wish I could do it again. I would do it every year if I could.” 
Cate Walter (COL ’25), who has a background in ballet, attended the show and said the performance was very clean, something she said is hard to achieve with such a large group and with dancers who don’t have much dance experience.
“I feel like I have a more critical eye as a dancer, and I was still really impressed by all of the pieces,” Walter said. “All of the movement was super different from everything that I’m used to, but I actually definitely want to do it next year.”
Walter said the performance differed from the more formal, noninteractive ballet shows she is used to watching.
“Right from the beginning, there was a lot of cheering and yelling in support of all the dancers and it made it a very lively and fun atmosphere that engaged the audience very well, which I really enjoyed,” Walter told The Hoya. “That was probably my favorite part of it.”
Rangila is not just about dance — Philanthropy Chair Shevani Tewari (SFS ’24) said philanthropy is central to the organization’s mission. Last year’s virtual Rangila raised money for Bethesda-based charity Edu-GIRLS, which helps girls living in poverty in South Asia access education. 
Since the performance was held virtually and raised only a few thousand dollars, Rangila decided to partner with Edu-GIRLS again this year, according to Tewari. 
“We really like Edu-GIRLS’ mission,” Tewari told The Hoya. “Instead of just throwing a lot of money at a general cause, they really invest a lot of money specifically in a handful of girls and make sure that their lives fundamentally change for the better.” 
The money that Rangila raised this year will support Edu-GIRLS’ Reach For The Stars Scholarship Program, which will cover all expenses for girls to study engineering at top colleges in India. It costs $1,000 to cover the yearly expenses for one girl. 
Rangila coordinators are still tallying the total amount of funds raised, but Tewari said they raised at least $20,000 of their $30,000 goal. 
The scholarship program specifically targets girls who come from poor backgrounds, according to Edu-GIRLS Founder and Chair Anand Seth. 
“Rangila will provide us with much needed resources to extend the RfS program to exciting careers in medicine, law and public administration in 2022,” Seth wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are grateful to the Georgetown University South Asia Club for choosing to help EduGIRLS take the REACH FOR THE STARS program to new heights.”
Malla said this performance was different from others she has done, as it combined her passion for dance with a focus on philanthropy. 
“It was especially important to me because dance is something that I’ve been passionate about since I was little,” Malla said. “Using dance as the outlet to raise so much money for an organization that does so much for girls around the world is really special.”
Malla said emotions among the organizers and performers were running high, especially at the end of the second show. 
“I broke out in tears because I was so proud of how the show came together,” Malla said. “It’s something that meant a lot to all of us, and just doing it with your best friends by your side made it all the better.”

While India struggles with data access, improved journalistic practices may offer a solution, author and data journalist Rukmini Shrinivasan said at a book talk.
Shrinivasan spoke at an Oct. 21 event titled “Data, Politics and Public Policy in Modern India,” hosted by Georgetown University’s Asian Studies Program. The event featured a discussion with Shrinivasan on the political implications of her research, which ranged from personal interviews with Indian locals to expert statisticians. McCourt School of Public Policy Professor Jishnu Das moderated the book talk, which was also organized by Asian Studies Teaching Professor Cecilia Van Hollen and Economics Associate Professor Shareen Joshi. The optimization of political data analysis is the central focus of Shrinivasan’s book “Whole Numbers and Half Truths: What Data Can and Cannot Tell Us About Modern India,” which was published in December 2021.
According to Van Hollen, Shrinivasan’s work exemplifies the essential role of data collection in effective governance and strengthened democracy. Van Hollen said data can provide leaders with accurate information on how to best lead.
“She also pointed to the dangers of inaccurate, incomplete data during the COVID-19 pandemic when data dramatically under-reported COVID-related deaths, leading to a false sense of public health security,” Van Hollen wrote to The Hoya. “Good data can help guide political action and strategy and Shrinivasan’s talk was also a call to action for developing global networks to build up good, reliable data on India for Indians.”
Van Hollen said Shrinivasan also noted the prevalence of incorrect stereotypes about the political views of the Indian people that could be dispelled by paying more attention to statistical findings.
“In her talk at Georgetown, she demonstrated the importance of looking at reliable data as a way to counter assumptions that people may have about Indian society,” Van Hollen wrote. “For example, people who live in liberal bubbles, often assert that most Indians believe in the importance of secular democracy and that inter-caste and inter-religious marriages have been increasing over time, whereas the data does not bear this out at all.”
According to Das, Shrinivasan’s mission to integrate data analysis into Indian journalism was inspired by the work of American publications like The New York Times. Das said it is important to stress Shrinivasan’s insight that journalism can act as a medium to simplify often complex data and language to the general public.
“She was saying we really need to use the media to democratize an understanding of data, and I thought that is absolutely fascinating,” Das told The Hoya. “It’s not the experts or the technocrats that need to figure out how to use and work with data. You need to explain to the polity in general what the data is, what its uses are, where the problems are and be honest about them.”
The problem of complex data analysis that is not easily accessible for most people is a global issue, according to Joshi.
“This is actually one of the challenges of our time: the rapid spread of digital technologies across the world, together with the advances in computing power have created a huge volume of data, but for citizens much of that data remains inaccessible and incomprehensible,” Joshi wrote to The Hoya.
Joshi said it is essential to remain critical of data, warning that a lack of transparency and openness in data collection may lead to profit-based exploitation of vulnerable populations who are unaware of phenomena such as data mining.
“In the U.S. right now, those who own data typically have more power and influence than the people in their datasets –– think of social media companies,” Joshi said. “They have more incentive to use that data for their own interests rather than the improvement of public policy.”
Unless data is conveyed in more simplified, accessible ways, the majority of people will be unable to engage with and benefit from the massive influx of research in the digital age, according to Das.
“My sense is we’re at this weird juncture where the world is now full of more data than ever before, but somehow it feels like we have less information than ever before,” Das said.
According to Das, journalism must also work to teach the public how to properly interpret data to avoid misinformation.
Das said the future of data analysis is inherently tied to politics, which will dictate what kinds of information are prioritized in research.
“All data is political. What data do you actually choose to collect? What precise question do you ask?” Das said. “These are all going to be informed by a broader discussion that hopefully is taking place within a democratic debate.”

A team of students performed traditional South Asian dance at Vice President Kamala Harris’ Washington, D.C. residence for a celebration of Diwali on Oct. 21.
Guzaarish, a competitive Bollywood fusion dance team composed of 23 Georgetown University students, performed four different types of dance for an audience of over 100 politicians, actors and other prominent members of the South Asian community including Charithra Chandran, who plays Edwina Sharma in the hit Netflix series “Bridgerton” and U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy. 
Harris, the first person of South Asian descent to serve as U.S. Vice President, hosted the event to celebrate Diwali, a Hindu religious festival also known as the Festival of Lights. 
Rishma Vora (SFS ’23), who helped found Guzaarish in 2019 and served as captain for three years, said the performance was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the team, who competed nationally for the first time in Spring 2022.
“It was like this insane dream that we didn’t even know we had,” Vora told The Hoya. “It really means a lot for a South Asian person to be able to have this experience.”
The team also got to mingle with guests at the event after their performance, according to Vora.
“Charithra Chandran actually came up to us and told us that she was so happy that we danced to a song in her native language,” Vora said. “It was surreal to be around all of them.”
Vora said a close friend of the team recommended Guzaarish to the Vice President as soon as she expressed interest in finding Bollywood dancers to perform at the celebration. Just nine days before the event, Vora received a call confirming Guzaarish would be performing. 
Guzaarish Finance Captain Druhi Dangi (MSB ’25) said the team’s four-minute performance included several different styles of dance: Raas, a traditional Indian folk dance; Bhangra, a popular Punjabi folk dance; Bollywood, a theatrical fusion dance; and Kuthu, a South Asian folk dance. A group of youth dancers from the Taal Academy of Dance, a D.C.-based Indian dance company, performed after Guzaarish.
Guzaarish usually dances to mixes of traditional South Asian music with Western songs, but event organizers said they wanted the team to take a more traditional approach for their Diwali performance, according to Vora. 
“We took what was already within our repertoire and changed some of the songs around,” Vora said. “For example, we took our Bollywood piece that was a mix between the song ‘Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!’ and a South Asian song and we ended up having the same choreo to a different South Asian song.”
Harris’ team invited Dangi and two other members of the executive board, Logistics and Operations Captain Ruhie Rapolu (COL ’25) and Choreography Captain Prisha Punjabi (COL ’25), to visit Harris’ residence two days before the event to see the space where the team would be performing. 
Preparations for the performance coincided with deadlines to submit audition videos for competitions taking place in Spring 2023, so the team could only rehearse once for the show, according to Dangi. 
Punjabi said the team rehearsed together until 2 a.m. to perfect their routine the night before the performance.
“We had a five-and-a-half-hour practice that night,” Punjabi said. “Usually our practices don’t go that long, but because it was such an important thing, everyone was super excited to practice and the morale was really high.”
After the performance, the team got to meet, speak with and take photos with Harris, who gave motivational remarks to the performers and encouraged the team to continue to take pride in their heritage. The team also joined the rest of the guests in a sparkler ceremony, a popular tradition celebrating the festival of lights, outside Harris’ home. 
Vora said the performance was a success and reflected a culmination of years-long commitment to the club for seniors on the team, who helped start Guzaarish in their first year on the Hilltop.
“It’s just an incredibly proud moment as Georgetown students, as South Asian students, to be able to have been inside of the vice president’s residence and meet her and share something we work and practice nine hours a week for,” Vora said. “We really are dedicated and passionate about what we do and to have been able to share that on such an important stage was everything we could have asked for and more.”

At an event hosted by Georgetown University’s Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, panelists spoke about a recent increase in anti-Muslim discrimination in India. 
Speakers at the Nov. 21 webinar, titled “India and the Rise of Islamophobia: Why and Why Now?” included Berkley Center Senior Fellow Jocelyne Cesari and Kalpana Jain, senior journalist and senior ethics and religion editor at The Conversation U.S., an independent, nonprofit publisher that focuses on news stories and research reports. Cesari and Jain discussed the effects of India’s fluid stance on religious tolerance and the increase in power of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India’s pro-Hindu political party, in the country’s government. 
Cesari said that although religious tensions have always been present in India, the BJP’s rise to power, combined with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, has intensified the issue.
“The reason for our conversation comes from the very alarming situation of continuous attacks against Muslims in India: lynching, discrimination, attacks on people,” Cesari said at the event. “This is not something that has been absent completely from Indian society, but it really raised in the last mandate of Modi, and it even was exacerbated by the pandemic.”
In India’s 2014 elections, the BJP won the majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s bicameral Parliament, and Narendra Modi became prime minister.
Jain said Modi’s government demonstrated they would not allow criticism by dismissing reports of lynchings and attacks on Muslims for eating beef, a practice against Hindu dietary restrictions. 
According to Jain, in the past few years, the BJP-controlled Indian government has increasingly censored dissent in the media. In 2020, the government arrested almost 70 journalists, citing sedition and counterterrorism laws.
Jain added that certain groups like Durga Vahini, a Hindu nationalist organization, have played into people’s fears that Muslim leaders will force out Hindu traditions and culture in India.
She said these groups attempt to present Islam as a threat to Hindu culture in India. 
“They’re indoctrinating them into a very different version of history, which is a very Hindu nationalist history,” Jain said at the event. “In conversation with them, what they revealed, to a certain extent, were a lot of the fears that they are being made to think about and that are playing into their mind and even joining this organization.”
Citizens worry that Islam will take over India, that Hindus will have no land left and that women will marry into and convert to Islam, according to Jain.
However, Jain said there has been pushback against Modi and the BJP. In the 2021 West Bengal State elections Trinamool Congress (TMC), an oppositional Indian political party, won a majority of the vote against the BJP. TMC now holds the majority in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, a unicameral legislature in charge of passing laws for over 90 million constituents.
Jain said that in many ways, the BJP is actually losing ground in India, as they have lost the support of some major states including Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. 
“People want more than religion,” Jain said. “We have to also acknowledge that people are smart enough to see, ‘are we being fooled in the name of religion?’”
Cesari said India’s diverse political and sociocultural landscape makes it a compelling subject for an analysis of political power. 
“So when we turn to India, it’s quite an interesting composite,” Cesari said. “It’s a subcontinent. It covers multiple languages, ethnicities, local tradition.” 
This diversity tends to play into religious tensions, specifically at the local level, due to the country’s decentralized structure, according to Cesari.
Jain said that globally, other states are encountering similar religious tensions.
“It is an erosion of civil liberties of all its citizens,” Jain said. “It’s an erosion of the freedom of the media that we’ve seen all this way. We’ve seen people arrested and killed, who are not just Muslims, but it extends to other religious groups as well.”

Rangila, Georgetown University’s annual South Asian dance showcase for charity, celebrated its 28th year of performances with the theme “Growing the Roots,” paying homage to the rich history and culture of the South Asian diaspora while raising over $25,000 for a charity that supports underprivileged communities overseas. 
The Nov. 18 and 19 performances included pieces influenced by numerous dance and music styles found across the Indian subcontinent. Rangila is a months-long effort of the GU South Asian Society (SAS) and the larger South Asian community at Georgetown to honor heritage and celebrate cultural diversity.
Rangila coordinator Ananya Amirthalingam (COL ’23) said she aimed for the theme of this year’s show to emphasize the importance of South Asian representation to the Georgetown community.
“Our theme this year, ‘Growing the Roots,’ reifies our commitment to learning from our heritages and histories while also boldly welcoming change and transformation,” Amirthalingam wrote to The Hoya. “’Rangila: Growing the Roots embodies personal growth from individually honoring our roots and communal growth, as we move towards consciously prioritizing diversity and broader representation of the South Asian diaspora.”
Over 350 student dancers and choreographers participated in this year’s performance, according to Amirthalingam.
As a philanthropic showcase, the organization selects a philanthropic partner to raise money and awareness for each year. The Rangila philanthropy board selected Distressed Children and Infants International (DCI), an organization that provides support to underprivileged communities in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Nicaragua through educational support, health care, eye care and other projects.
Komal Samrow (SFS ’25), director of internal outreach for Rangila’s philanthropy board, said the board chose to support DCI because of its dedication to service in vulnerable South Asian communities.
“In selecting a philanthropic organization to partner with this year, we really wanted to select an organization that embodied Georgetown’s emphasis on service, especially for marginalized populations — a key focus of DCI’s work,” Samrow wrote to The Hoya. “We also looked for an organization that serves throughout South Asia, as a testament to the diversity of our South Asian community here at Georgetown.” 
Before the show, the Rangila team held several other philanthropic events on and off campus to support DCI, according to Samrow. In addition to fundraisers at Chipotle and Crepeaway on Nov. 2 and Sep. 29 respectively, the Rangila team sold custom candles and wooden roses that audience members could gift to dancers and choreographers. Rangila also collaborated with other Georgetown student organizations, including GU Bubble, to sell chai boba at the GU Farmers Market and The Corp to sell specialty food and drink items at their storefronts.
Samrow said that while these efforts were successful on the fundraising front, it was less effective than the showcase in raising awareness for Rangila’s cause, an equally important goal. 
“We hoped to raise at least $25,000 dollars this year, and we are extremely proud to have exceeded that goal by several thousand dollars,” Samrow said. “Beyond the money, however, as a philanthropy board one of our primary aims was to ensure that Rangila’s philanthropic mission was well known and communicated to the community this year.”
The show consisted of ten dances and a musical program called Studio Rangila. Many of the dances featured popular South Asian styles such as Desi Hip Hop, Bharatanatyam and South Indian folk dances, with a twist of hip-hop, modern and Afro-Latinx styles incorporated into the performances, according to the event’s program. This year’s show also included the first Nepali-inspired dance in the show’s history.
SAS President Nikash Harapanahalli (SFS ’24) said they felt it was important for Rangila to offer a complete representation of the breadth and diversity of the South Asian diaspora.
“Those dance styles meant not just taking the heritage of a South Asian past, but breathing it into an innovative and dynamic present to build a more inclusive and representative future,” Harapanahalli told The Hoya. “That future was seen when we heard our first-ever Nepali song and dance on the Gaston stage.”
Harapanahalli said they hope members of the South Asian community at Georgetown walked away from the show feeling proud of their culture and the way it is reflected at the university.
“For me personally, growing our roots meant not just seeing myself grow as an individual or grow as a South Asian but to grow as a member of the Georgetown community,” Harapanahalli said. “This was the first time where I was able to meaningfully share my culture with a non-South Asian community and it was also the first time where I really learned from other South Asian communities.”

A State Department employee and Georgetown University graduate delivered the keynote lecture at the McCourt School of Public Policy Writing Center’s biannual event, speaking on editing in policymaking and other professional capacities. 
Elizabeth Evans (SFS ’03), a foreign service officer in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, headlined the Jan. 19 event. In her role, she manages the American cohort of the Quad partnership, an informal diplomatic network between Australia, Japan, India and the United States. Evans has also served in Seoul, South Korea; Auckland, New Zealand; and Taiwan as both a diplomat and an intern.
Evans centered her discussion around strategies for editing in the most effective manner, ranging from the actual process of editing to how to approach making suggestions in a professional yet confident manner.
To start writing on any topic, Evans said you must first reflect on how the subject matter is related to your own identity.
“You need to have that background. You need to have done that homework. It’s going to help angle your writing,” Evans said at the event.
Evans also said facilitating progress should be at the forefront of the policy writing process. 
“And a reminder that all policy writing is about managing change of some kind,” Evans said. “If everything were perfect and were going to remain perfect indefinitely, you wouldn’t need a policy.”
In describing her personal approach to writing long-form content, Evans said her drafting process is never linear.
“I don’t like to just start at the beginning of a paper and go to the end. I find I get writer’s block, I get stressed out,” Evans said. “So instead, I do this. The audiences, the objectives, the parameters. What exactly we’re fighting for.”
Evans said simplifying one’s writing into something that can be easily shared in conversation is the key to getting people’s attention.
“In the end, you should have a two-sentence ‘mega-talker.’ That’s your elevator speech. Short, succinct, punchy,” Evans said.
Based on that short pitch, Evans said the next steps involve honing in on easily memorable highlights of what you’re writing that can stick with listeners, emphasizing the importance of repeating key talking points to make your message as clear as possible.
When editing, Evans said it is important to balance being both assertive and polite to best accomplish your goals when suggesting changes to a piece.
“Always edit with confidence and diplomacy, meaning if you think your edits are necessary, stand behind them — they probably are, and work on them — but also be diplomatic,” Evans said. “Recognize that when people see red ink, it hurts their feelings — even when it shouldn’t.”
Evans also said it is essential to be mindful of not silencing the perspectives and opinions of authors.
“Going back to my previous point about editing style, clarifying the point is valuable. Erasing the voice is not,” Evans said. 
While editing can sometimes seem cutthroat, the end goal must always be mediation, according to Evans.
“Find out a happy medium along the way so that the product continues to improve without destroying your relationship with your colleagues,” Evans said.
Evans said editing should not be taken personally, and that it is essential to producing quality content.
“There’s nothing offensive about making edits,” Evans said. “Good writing is rewriting.”

CW: This article references racism and racial violence. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
An exhibit that features photos, sketches and relics from the life of Emmett Till opened with a special event at the D.C. Public Library’s (DCPL) Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library on Jan. 26. 
The “Emmett Till & Mamie Till-Mobley: Let the World See,” exhibit, which comes as a result of a partnership between the Emmett Till & Mamie Till-Mobley Institute, the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, the Till family and The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis, tells the story of the life and murder of Till, a 14-year-old boy who was abducted and lynched in 1955, and Till-Mobley, his mother. The exhibit features quotations, first-hand accounts, photos, videos and interactive installments like a family guide, which advises families on how to navigate the emotionally difficult exhibit with children, and a reflection area dedicated to helping visitors process what they see.
The exhibit covers ways community and family members have worked to keep Till’s memory alive, how attendees can commit to social justice in their communities and how recent cases of vandalized historical markers dedicated to Till demonstrate how important it is to continue sharing Till’s story from the perspective of his community, according to a DCPL press release.
Patrick Weems, the executive director of the Emmett Till Interpretive Center in Sumner, Miss., a center located near the site of Till’s death dedicated to telling Till’s story as a means of restorative justice, said the exhibit is especially meaningful given that the center’s original historical marker, a silver plaque that marked the place where Till’s body was removed from the river, was shot and vandalized for the third time just a few years ago. 
“This newly created exhibit helps us explore why it is so difficult to honor the memory of a 14-year-old child,” Weems wrote in a statement shared with The Hoya. “We believe that telling the truth about these acts of violence and injustice is the first step towards racial healing.”
Till-Mobley insisted on an open-casket funeral to shed light on the brutal, violent nature of her son’s murder, according to the press release. 
The traveling exhibit had its debut at The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis before moving to the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute and finally reaching Washington, D.C., where it will remain on display until March 12.
The exhibit will then travel to Two Mississippi Museums in Jackson, Miss., the DuSable Museum of African American History in Chicago, the Atlanta History Center and the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tenn., before it will be housed permanently in the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, which is located near the site Till’s murder trial took place in Sumner, Miss. 
Richard Reyes-Gavilan, DCPL’s executive director, said the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Library hopes the exhibit will remind people of the continuous violence still happening years after Till’s death.
“We are honored to work with this incredible team of institutions as well as Emmett Till’s family to elevate this harrowing story and call attention to the ongoing threats of violence to which Black boys remain vulnerable,” Reyes-Gavilan wrote in a media guide that DCPL’s media relations manager George Williams shared with The Hoya. “Telling the story of Emmett and his mother, along with the stories of other real people from the past and present, gives the Library an opportunity to provide space for reflection, dialogue, and learning.” 
Two installations will stand alongside the Till exhibit in the library. The first is entitled “Local Connections: The Till Case Reaches DC,” and it displays the role that the D.C. NAACP, a famous civil rights organization, and Black reporters in the District played in telling Till’s story. The second, “Mothers of the Movement,” highlights D.C. police brutality and the work mothers and families have done to fight for justice in the footsteps of Till-Mobley.
Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., Till’s cousin and the last living witness to his abduction, said he applauds the curators of the exhibit for preserving Till’s life and legacy from his family’s perspective.  
“Your dedication and pursuit of social justice and racial reconciliation resonate with my commitment to the truth, forgiveness and reconciliation,” Parker said in the media guide. 
Parker said he hopes visitors will come away with an understanding of ways to combat racial injustices in modern society. 
“The thing I want families to take away from this is that we can learn from the past on what not to do, and we can improve on race relations at this time,” Parker said. “Emmett Till’s story is not a pleasant story — it’s not a pretty story, but it has to be told. It must be told because we need to know the truth.”

Content creators rallied outside of the U.S. Capitol on March 22 in response to congressional talks of banning TikTok, a popular China-based social media application with over 1 billion users.
Congressman Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) organized a press conference with more than 20 social media content creators, including Naomi Hearts, Aidan Kohn-Murphy, founder of GenZforChange, and V Spehar to protest the possible TikTok ban. The content creators, whose combined digital following comprises over 60 million people, shared at the conference how the app has positively impacted their lives, small businesses and communities. 
Bowman said banning TikTok will not solve the app’s underlying data and privacy issues.
“The rush to ban TikTok sets a dangerous precedent for our country by undermining our freedom of speech and distracts from the real issue: protecting Americans’ data and privacy,” Bowman said in a March 22 press release.
Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) introduced on March 7 the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act, which allows the federal government to regulate technology and applications that countries posing a national security threat produce. These nations, which the legislation dubs “foreign adversaries,” include China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela.
Meg Leta Jones, associate professor in the Communication, Culture & Technology Program at Georgetown University, a Masters of Arts degree focusing on the impact of technology on society, said conversations about the Tiktok ban stem from several concerns such as the app’s addictive nature, security concerns and international competition in the American technology sector.
A 2022 Pew Research Center study reported that 67% of U.S. teens have used TikTok and 16% of all teens say they use it almost constantly. Additionally, more than 150 million Americans, including 5 million U.S. small businesses, are on TikTok, according to the Bowman press release.
Bowman said the government needs to create all-encompassing regulations rather than banning one app and infringing on free speech rights.
“I, along with millions of others, use TikTok as a place to interact with my community in a positive, uplifting way,” the press release reads. “But this is not about defending TikTok as a company. We need strong regulation that applies to every platform in order to protect our data and especially our children. And we also have to protect young people’s right to free expression.”
Jones said there are many ways in which TikTok influences Americans.
“If the Chinese government is (or can become) involved in either the data collection or content delivery side, U.S. policymakers are concerned about everything from blackmail of U.S. officials to subtle anti-American messaging through influencers, hashtags, and imagery,” Jones wrote to The Hoya.
A bill to ban TikTok from government devices passed on Dec. 14, 2022 and remains in effect. Jones said other countries have begun to ban the app, and it is possible the United States will follow.
“Other countries like India have already banned TikTok and users turn to Reels,” Jones wrote. “Because there are only two mobile operating systems (Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS) with their own app stores for getting programs on phones, making an app illegal makes it fairly inaccessible because those two major tech companies will comply with U.S. law.”
Jones also said that a TikTok ban in the United States would go against certain American principles.
“The first is an open market global trade policy principle, which China has already complicated significantly, having long banned American tech companies like Google and Facebook,” Jones wrote. “The second is open access to information and expression. I’m not a First Amendment scholar, and there are surprisingly diverse opinions about whether a TikTok ban would violate the Constitution.”
Jones said that while it seems unlikely, if the ban were to pass, it would be influential in changing American society.
“TikTok’s massive popularity makes a ban seem unimaginable, but it reminds me of when a series of copyright cases swiftly demolished peer-to-peer music sharing in the early 2000s,” Jones wrote. “Apple made iTunes, and we all survived, but it was a pivotal moment in the history of music and technology. Banning TikTok and the regulation of social media across U.S. states may be a pivotal moment too.”

Members of Georgetown’s Circle of Indigenous Students’ Alliance (CISA) partnered with two Smithsonian Institution museums to view tribal artifacts in museum archives on April 7. 
Alanna Cronk (CAS ’23), CISA’s chief liaison to the Smithsonian and a member of the Ventureño Chumash tribe, led CISA’s partnerships with the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian and the Museum of Natural History last summer after becoming familiar with many Smithsonian collections through previous research.
In addition to CISA’s partnership with the Smithsonian, the group has also partnered with an educational liaison to develop a museum program for fall 2023 examining the evolution of Indigenous arts and the environment. This program will be hosted at the Museum of Natural History’s Q?rius, an interactive exhibit that features hands-on exploration of animals and objects from around the world. 
“It was a very moving experience for everybody and it felt really great to get to be a key player in helping facilitate a bunch of other Indigenous students to have the kind of experience I did — which is not necessarily a joyous experience in the archive, but one that does feel deeply meaningful,” Cronk told The Hoya.
Cronk, a descendant of the Ventureño Chumash basket weaver Petra Pico, whose art is part of the Smithsonian’s collection, conducted an independent project last summer on the epistemology of basket weaving through Georgetown’s Kalorama Fellowship, an award for students in the humanities, social sciences and environmental sciences with original ideas for summer research projects. 
Matthew Vestuto, an anthropological researcher and the vice chair of the Ventureño Chumash tribe, introduced Cronk to Torben Rick, the Natural History Museum’s curator of North American archaeology, who took Cronk on a tour of the Smithsonian’s Indigenous archives.
Cronk said viewing the archival cabinets at the Smithsonian brought them unexpected feelings. 
“When Rick opened the cabinets, I felt a wave of loneliness smack me in the face, and I didn’t anticipate that,” Cronk said. “I sang to the baskets in my Native language for some time, and then I went to work photographing them to confirm details for my research.”
While in the archives, Cronk also saw their ancestor’s artistic artifacts, an experience that they said was inspiring.
“I got to access some of Petra Pico’s baskets, and that’s always very exciting when you can directly hold an object one of your ancestors made,” Cronk said.
Cronk said their experience inspired them to ask Rick about a potential collaboration between CISA and the Smithsonian.
“Here I had this connection with the curator of North American archaeology himself, and then I had CISA, which I care about so much, and I mustered up the courage to ask for an opportunity for a partnership between the two,” Cronk said. 
CISA board member Tianna Young (CAS ’25), a member of the Diné tribe, said she saw a variety of Diné objects during CISA’s tour of the museum, ranging from weapons like bows and arrows to more personal belongings like turquoise jewelry and spiritual dolls.
While the trip fascinated Young, she said it also left her conflicted about how to interpret the Natural History Museum’s ownership of over 800 Diné artifacts.
“There’s the big question of ownership, of how this all got here,” Young told The Hoya. “Should I be upset or should I be honored that there are 800 artifacts here? But the answer to that question comes down to the individual, and how they choose to feel about that.”
The artifacts were typically purchased or stolen by wealthy donors or archaeologists to display in the museums’ collections. One such collector, the mining engineer George Gustav Heye, opened the National Museum of the American Indian in 1916 to display and conduct research on his collection of 800,000 pieces, which included a variety of artifacts such as Plains Indian pottery and Diné tribal shirts.
Young will transition with Rachel Two Bulls (CAS ’24) into Cronk’s role as CISA’s head liaison with the Smithsonian when Cronk graduates this spring.
Two Bulls, a member of the Lakota tribe, said visiting the museum, which displays only a small proportion of the Smithsonian’s 825,000 tribal artifacts, was a unique experience, but that it made her consider the implications of keeping so many valuable artifacts in storage.
“It leaves you wondering what you do with these spaces, with these artifacts that don’t see the light of day in this very large facility,” Two Bulls told The Hoya. “There definitely needs to be a conversation about that.” 
Two Bulls said she plans on organizing more tours and meetings between CISA and the Smithsonian in the future, including another tour of the Smithsonian’s other collections.  
“There was just so much for everyone to see and so much for everyone to think about,” Two Bulls said. “I didn’t want to rush.” 
Cronk said they anticipate furthering CISA’s partnership with the Smithsonian even after their graduation to create networking opportunities for Indigenous students interested in anthropological, historical and cultural studies. 
“The resources may have been hoarded, but they still can be used in a positive way for all Indigenous students to discover their heritage,” Cronk said. 
“It’s not always a joyous experience, but it’s an empowering and uplifting one, and it helps them develop as critical thinkers, educators and future leaders,” Cronk added.

From advocating for wage increases for the Department of Public Safety officers to protesting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, this year has been marked by a surge of student activism on campus, with many choosing to hold public rallies or demonstrations to draw attention to their causes.
According to James Reardon-Anderson, senior associate dean and director of undergraduate programs in the School of Foreign Service, peaceful protest and the ensuing dialogue is a large part of being a student at a university.
“When students care enough to get active about something, generally speaking, it’s a good sign. Sometimes it gets a little bit excessive, but that is just the way people are. This is a democracy and you have to allow for a certain amount of give and take,” Reardon-Anderson said.
One particularly highly public demonstration was the protest organized by Plan A: Students for Reproductive Justice during one of the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program Open House Weekend in March. Supporters chained themselves to the statue of John Carroll in Healy Circle, shouted chants and passed out fliers to current members of the Georgetown community as well as many prospective students. While some prospective families said they did not support the protest, many said they viewed it as a sign that Georgetown students are active on campus.
“It gives a perspective to a potential student as to how their voices will be heard, given that there is an opportunity to protest. It feels good that groups are comfortable expressing themselves to the administration,” prospective parent Lesli Adams of Anaheim, Calif., said to THE HOYA on March 27.
Bryan Woll (COL ’12), president of Georgetown University College Democrats, agreed. He said that the expression of a diversity of opinions is integral to a democratic society and an academic community.
“There seems to be the general aversion to all things [similar to] public disturbance, things not common place, people making their voices heard in a loud way. The fact that people are uncomfortable about that is something we should get beyond,” Woll said.
The student activism may indicate that Georgetown students, in particular, have a heightened awareness of issues within the community.
“Georgetown students have a very strong sense of social responsibility. That’s part of what we work to imbed in our students. That is something we find to be a very attractive quality,” Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations, said.
But there are many who believe that there is a careful line between productive discussion and disrespect. According to Reardon-Anderson, protest goes too far if there is ever violence or the threat of violence. Others believe that activism takes an adverse form when it infringes on others’ right to free speech.
“Students are not only allowed to express their views but also encouraged to do so,” Will Downes (COL ’11) said. “As a general rule, you have the right of freedom of expression and protest, but not at the expense of others’ right to free speech.”
Those who protested at Gen. David Petraeus’ address in Gaston Hall on Jan. 21 were criticized along these lines by many members of the Georgetown community.
A groups of students, led by Jon Askonas (SFS ’13), organized to form Students for Respectful Dialogue and co-hosted a counterprotest in reaction to the anti-war protests.
“Our issue wasn’t with their message. Our message to them was, You are hurting yourself if you are attacking someone else’s free speech to promote your own,” Askonas said. “It makes yourself look bad.”
Chessa Gross (SFS ’10), a participant in the counterprotest, ultimately deemed the demonstration
successful because they were able to effectively convey their message.
“I think the issue with the negative reaction to the Petraeus protests was the assumption that this speech was intended to be dialogue. Petraeus’ `strategic engagement’ speech to promote the U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan was not planned as a dialogue,” Gross said. “This was planned as a propaganda event with canned responses to audience questions – by no means is that a `dialogue.'”
any of the protests this year, including the call for a wage raise for DPS officers to improve student safety and Georgetown Divest!, a coalition seeking to persuade the university to divest from companies that violate human rights in Israel and Palestine, demanded response and action from the university administration.
“The university supports the right of everyone in our community to make their views known in a dignified manner,” Director of Media Relations Andy Pino said. “To that end, we offer numerous avenues where our students and members of our faculty and staff can provide insight and input on decisions that affect nearly every aspect of university life.”
In that sense, many of the campaigns have been successful. Plan A was granted a meeting with administrators and continues to engage in productive discussion with the university. And while a compromise has not been reached, LaMarr Billups, assistant vice president for business policy planning, has responded to the concerns of the Divest! coalition.
“To a certain degree, a campus has to tolerate some space there,” Reardon-Anderson said. “[A university] can certainly impose its rules and so forth, but it doesn’t want to be too draconian,” he said.
The push for a DPS wage raise also had real, tangible results. According to Gross, a member of Georgetown Solidarity Committee, new officers were being paid about $15 per hour – lower than any other university safety officer in the District, who largely receive about $18 or $19 per hour. When their contract came up for negotiation, the university offered them a raise of 40 cents.
“They came to us because they were in a bind,” Gross said. “They were under a university gag order against publicly advocating for themselves. In the end, it was students and officers fighting together that made a wage raise possible.”
After writing to the administration, hosting a rally on campus, and engaging in a silent protest during negotiations, the supporters were able to publicize their opinions. In the end, the officers were ultimately granted a raise of $2.50.
While the lasting impact of these campaigns and the future of this trend of student activism is uncertain, the demonstrations have captured the attention of the Georgetown community, fulfilling the ultimate goal of the student participants.
“I am actually attracted to protest,” Reardon-Anderson said, “just to see what students think about and are concerned about.”

The administration dealt a blow to Georgetown, Divest!, a coalition of students on campus that wants the university to divest from companies that may profit from human rights abuses in Israel and Palestine, on Tuesday.
Assistant Vice President for Business Policy and Planning LaMarr Billups wrote a letter to Georgetown, Divest! stating that the administration would not modify its investment practices.
Referencing the coalition’s April 9 meeting with a senior team of administrators, Billups wrote, “At that meeting you asked if Georgetown University would divest from managed funds that own stocks in certain companies that do business with Israel. The answer to that question is no.”
The question of divestment is a difficult one, since the university does not invest directly in companies, but rather in managed funds. The Investment Office does not make its investments public.
“Georgetown’s investment practices do not include the selection of individual securities,” Director of Media Relations Andy Pino said. “As a result, the question of divestment does not apply.”
Still, Georgetown, Divest! member and Vice President of Students for Justice in Palestine Jackson Perry (COL ’12) said he knows Georgetown, Divest!’s struggles are not for nothing.
“First of all, [Chief Investment Officer Larry Kochard] told us that he believed we were invested in Caterpillar,” Perry said. Caterpillar is one of the companies that Georgetown, Divest! has asked the university to divest from.
Perry added, “Condoms and cohabitation are not permitted on campus because they are not in keeping with the Jesuit values of the institution, yet the administration thinks our Jesuit values shouldn’t play a role in investment decisions at all? This is hypocrisy.”
Other schools around the country are also pushing university administrations to divest.
According to a press release from the chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine at University of California, Berkeley, students have been working to pass a bill through the UC Berkeley Student Senate on divestment since March.
On Wednesday, the UC Berkeley Student Senate met to vote on a bill that would urge the university to divest from two companies that profit from the manufacture of weapons for the Israeli Army. The student senate failed to override the veto on the bill, falling short by just one vote.
Other American universities that have called for divestment include the University of Michigan Dearborn, Hampshire College and the University of Wisconsin.
“Changing the status quo is one of the hardest things for anyone to do,” Perry said. “However, we are optimistic that the right amount of pressure from various directions, including especially the constant reminder of the moral values of our university itself, will break through the bureaucratic inertia and amoral mindset that is currently dominating the way the university has responded.”
**Correction:** This article stated that the GUSA Senate met to vote on a bill that would urge the university to divest from two companies. The UC Berkeley Student Senate met to vote on such a bill.

On Monday, September 13, 2010, the Center for Peace and Security Studies hosted a discussion on the START Treaty. One of the two people invited was Richard Burt, the U.S. Chair of Global Zero, a group dedicated to reducing the number of nuclear weapons to zero. The very first person to ask a question to the panel was Dane Shikman (SFS ’13), the executive director of the Georgetown University branch of Global Zero. After the discussion, Shikman agreed to an interview with The Hoya.
What motivated the foundation of the Global Zero chapter at Georgetown University?
Global Zero movement has been gaining steam with North Korea testing their nuclear weapons and with Iran testing their nuclear capabilities, and that has given us the momentum to step up to the plate and to face these proliferation issues in a new way, saying that deterrence is the only way to combat nuclear proliferation, and that the only truly safe world is one in which nuclear weapons do not exist, or if they’re heavily monitored. On a national level, the Global Zero leaders decided that they wanted to form a grass-roots organization, rather than everything coming from the top down.
Why should people be motivated to fight for non-proliferation in this time-period, in the post-Cold War era?
The risk of nuclear weapons is vague. None of us can see it, New York or Washington D.C. being destroyed. We can’t envision it, and we don’t want to envision it. We have a habit of thinking that it’s not real. But if you talk to generals, they will tell you that there are terrorists that are hell bent to deliver nuclear weapons to New York City.
The threat is real. You have North Korea, which is continuing to defy the world, and Iran, which may develop a nuclear weapon in the next couple years, or even months. You have this new security environment, different from what existed in the Cold War. In this one, you can’t have huge numbers of nuclear weapons that can be easily accessed. The risk of nuclear catastrophe outweighs any of the benefits that used to exist during the Cold War.
Nuclear weapons are considered the ultimate deterrence. Why would the United States surrender the “ultimate weapon”?
The United States is the nation that needs nuclear weapons the least, because we have the strongest conventional armed forces in the world. We have extremely precise warheads that are not nuclear. Therefore, the issue of defense lies not with the United States, but with smaller states, which believe that nuclear weapons would be a deterrent. Nuclear deterrence, though, has been partially debunked, because if you look at multiple situations, you’ll see that nukes did not deter attacks, such as with Israel in the 1973 war, or the coalition forces during the First Gulf War. They knew that those nations had nuclear weapons, and that debunks the idea that nukes will prevent any form of attack against a nation.
How realistic do you think a world with no nukes is?
It will require international cooperation that we’ve never seen before, at an unprecedented level, that they’ve never been forced to do before. It will be very difficult, requiring the resolution of regional conflicts such as in Korea, or between Pakistan and India, and making sure that nations like Israel feel safe, so it’s going to be very hard, but we’ve done hard things, things we thought were impossible, like the United Nations. Therefore, us telling ourselves that it’s impossible is making that idea true. The more we say it’s futile, the less energy [we] put into making it a reality. The framework is there, with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which would just need extended powers to be a strong inspection force to be very effective. It’s about changing the paradigm of nations [to] one of trust.
Would there be a point of compromise that would be acceptable to your group?
If you have more nuclear weapons, then there’s more availability, and less safety. There’s a negative correlation between the number of weapons and the safety of the world. Optimally, we would have zero. However, I would prefer a world with fewer nuclear weapons than the world we have currently, but only in a world with no nuclear weapons would there be total safety.
Some politicians are making the START Treaty a political issue, accusing senators who vote for ratification of being soft on national security. Is this message affecting the public, and how do you plan on responding?
The political climate is very different from when the first START Treaty was signed. The Republican senators opposed to the treaty are not trying to make Americans safer, they’re trying to oppose President Obama. They’re focused on beating Obama, which creates significant problems with trying to ratify the treaty. It will have to involve grass-roots movements. It’s about convincing people that having large amounts of nuclear weapons is not the best, nor safest option for peace, and even after this bill, we’re still going to have 1,550 nuclear warheads. Even the most warlike of people will have to acknowledge that we still have a lot of nuclear weapons.
Is the non-proliferation movement also an anti-war movement?
Global Zero has nothing to do with conventional military strength. Many times, we actually refer to nation’s conventional forces to argue that they will have enough power to repel attacks, and that wars that are going to be fought should only be fought with conventional weapons. We are not primarily an anti-war group.
What are Global Zero’s plans to remove all nuclear arms from the world?
Global Zero has a step-by-step action plan that would ensure a timeframe. The START Treaty is a big step in that. The next step would be to bring Russia back to the table and make even more drastic cuts to nuclear arms levels. If we cut those all down to 1,000, we can encourage the rest of the world to enter the conversation.
How likely is it that a nuclear bomb will go off during our lifetimes?
I think it’s likely. Realistically speaking, I think it may take a nuclear explosion for the world to realize how serious of a problem nuclear proliferation is. If it happens, either here or in Europe, it might be an explosion that would galvanize everyone to make true steps to cut down on nuclear weapons.

With recently revived Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at risk of languishing due to ongoing Jewish settlement building in the West Bank, student groups at Georgetown have joined the contentious debate, calling for strong ties between the United States and Israel.
In a document released this fall, the Georgetown-Israel Alliance, College Democrats and College Republicans affirmed their agreement on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict despite their varying political affiliations.
“The statement covers three broad topics: recognition of Israel, support for a two-state solution, and opposition to Iran’s nuclear program,” Sam Blank (COL ’12), vice president of Political Affairs of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, said.
The document addresses issues that have been a source of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians since the establishment of Israel as a Jewish State in 1948, and advocates for a two-state solution under which “a democratic, viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish state of Israel, mutual respect and diplomatic relations between the two states, and protection of and respect for human rights of all peoples,” exists.
Despite the bipartisan nature of the document which was drafted last spring, not all campus groups are pleased with the statement.
“Any statement on the conflict that doesn’t address at all the crucial points of the status of Jerusalem, the settlements, or Palestinian refugees does not merit praise or attention,” said Jackson Perry (COL’ 12), treasurer of Students for Justice in Palestine, a student advocacy group that educates about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“They are vaguely restating boilerplate U.S. foreign policy,” Perry added. “Nothing more.”
The Georgetown Israel Alliance is a student-run organization that handles both political and cultural issues relating to Israel. As the only pro-Israel group on campus, the organization views its mission as two-fold – for education and advocacy.
“We seek to educate the Georgetown community on Israel’s culture and society, as well as promote dialogue and discussion on the various dimensions of the Middle East conflict,” Blank said. “We advocate for the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish, democratic state that grants human and civil rights to all her citizens, regardless of race, class, religion or upbringing.”
Blank said that the GIA, like Israel itself, has a diverse range of political opinions among its constituency.
“We have members who are right, left and center, as well as Jewish and non-Jewish. Our members hold a wide range of views on the conflict and how best to solve it,” Blank said. “However, we all equally yearn to see the day when Israelis and Palestinians can live together in peace and security.”
College Democrats President Bryan Woll (COL ’12) and Communications Director William Vogt (SFS ’12) issued a statement to THE HOYA regarding their organization’s involvement in the collaboration.
“Our membership represents the diverse body of opinions that makes up Georgetown’s community,” Woll and Vogt said in the statement.
“Our leadership had the privilege to work with GIA last semester on this statement, which reflects the sentiment of most of our members, but certainly not all of them. We pride ourselves in having and embracing a diversity of opinions within our organization, and this issue is no different.”
Kevin Preskenis (COL ’12), chief of staff for the College Republicans, was extensively involved in the preparation of this statement. He said that he looks forward to working with the GIA on what he believes to be a significant foreign policy issue.
“By signing on to the Georgetown Israel Alliance’s joint statement, we are expressing our broader foreign policy position on Israel, namely, its right to exist as a democratic, Jewish state, and our support of a strong alliance with the United States,” Preskenis said. “We also are hopeful of a two-state solution, in which the Palestinian authority recognizes Israel’s right to exist peacefully, which is a proposal the GIA statement addresses.”

Reflecting on his days as an academic, Turkey’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Ahmet Davutoglu spoke in Gaston Hall on Monday about Turkish foreign policy and his country’s relationship with the United States.
In his speech, Davutoglu emphasized Turkey’s importance in global affairs and the country’s hopes for greater global interdependence and peace.
“We want to have restoration in global politics, the global economy and global culture,” Davutoglu said. “We have a vision in Turkey . to create peaceful regional orders around us.”
Davutoglu worked in the academic world until November 2002, when he was appointed chief adviser to the prime minister and ambassador-at-large. He opened his speech by discussing his nostalgia for his life as an academic.
“People may think that once you have more power you have more freedom, but it is the opposite. Being a minister is hard,” he said. “You may have hundreds of ideas in your mind, but you have to have self-censorship.”
Eitan Paul (SFS ’12), chair of the International Relations Club, which co-sponsored the event, remarked on the academic influence on the speech.
“It was an interesting address in that he comes from a very intellectual and academic background,” Paul said.
In 2001, while he was a visiting lecturer at Turkey’s Military Academy, Davutoglu wrote “Stratejik Derinlik” (“Strategic Depth”). In it, he discusses the “zero problem with neighbors” theory, which emphasizes cooperation and establishing economic and cultural ties with neighbors rather than using sanctions or other harsh methods of diplomacy.
As minister of foreign affairs, a post he was appointed to in May 2009, Davutoglu has made his theory an integral part of Turkey’s foreign policy.
“My goal is to create a revolution in the old mentality of Turkish strategic thinking [that] all neighbors are enemies,” he said. “We need political restoration based on democratic values and economic restoration based on growth, but we can do it only if we restore our relations with our neighbors, with our allies and with new powers.”
Deflecting comments regarding Turkey’s conflicts with Greece and Israel last summer, Davutoglu said Turkey would work toward a common vision.
“Don’t worry, we will solve it,” he said.
“Turkey’s new approach to foreign policy is not without controversy,” Paul said. “A number of their positions are certainly less in line with U.S. policy and a Western approach to foreign policymaking.”
Kent Carlson (MSB ’14) felt that Davutoglu’s speech was very helpful for increasing his understanding of Turkey’s stance on various policies.
“I’d say he dodged some of the issues more than speaking candidly, but in the end he answered the questions, though not always fully,” he said. “

Campus discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may be stuck in the past, according to experts who visited Georgetown this week to transform talk of Middle East issues into a cooperative effort.
In Copley Formal Lounge, Middle East policy analysts Ghaith al-Omari, a Georgetown graduate, and David Makovsky presented their views about a cooperative two-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian woes, as part of “The Dialogue Initiative,” sponsored by the International Relations Club and the Georgetown Israel Alliance and nationally by the Israel on Campus Coalition.
According to both al-Omari and Makovsky, campus discussions across the country about the conflict are rooted too far in the past, not keeping pace with progress in the Middle East.
“The campus discourse, we thought, was too much about recriminations,” Makovsky said. “Usually the campuses are ahead of the curve on issues, but on this one issue across the country, we felt the campuses are behind the curve. While people are talking to each other in the Middle East, why can’t they talk to each other in the Northeast?”
Rather than forming factions, students should recognize that the interests of Israel and Palestine are not diametrically opposed, al-Omari said.
“You can be a pro-Palestine advocate without being anti-Israel,” he said.
He illustrated the way in which campus dialogue seems focused on the “zero-sum approach,” which states that what is good for one nation is bad for the other and the “tribal approach,” which delves into the history of both nations to justify conflict. Neither of these viewpoints, he argued, leaves room for objectivity or potential consensus.
“It’s very easy to point out the bad side of the other,” al-Omari said. “It is easy to get angry.”
He noted that as far back as the mid-1990s, both sides expressed willingness to settle for a two-state solution, even if media coverage has tended to highlight areas of conflict.
“The loudest voices that we hear are the extreme voices on both sides,” al-Omari explained. “Those who want to get along, get along quietly.”
Centrist activists tend to remain quiet about their activities, Makovsky explained, in part because they do not want to upset or embarrass other members of their nation.
“The reality on the ground is far more complex than you read in the newspapers,” Makovsky said. “It is based on the two sides working together. [There is] a de facto alliance that neither side talks about.”
Shifting collegiate dialogue to a more centrist approach could eventually overpower extremists who now stand in the way of unity. This approach motivates al-Omari and Makovsky in their efforts to campaign across campuses.
“If we are serious people for a two-state solution, then we have to build up both sides of the two-state solution,” Makovsky said. “We found that the faculty was not attuned to these developments on the ground, that their thinking was stuck in a very confrontational age. What we want to do is bring the message to the students that you’ve got to be forces for coexistence.”
The end goal for students is to find a viable solution to the conflict, and students are keen on using dialogue now so that policy implementation can occur later on.
“For us, we hope to change the topics of the dialogue,” Daphna Katz (COL ’12), co-president of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, said. “We are students on college campuses, so we aren’t going to be establishing peace in the Middle East here. What we can do is not go back to 1948, but have dialogue about how we can move forward.”

While most students begin courses at Georgetown just months after graduating from high school, some accepted students are opting to take a gap year before embarking on their university careers.
The Wall Street Journal reported in December that a Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles found that 1.2 percent of freshmen at four-year colleges waited a year before enrolling in school.
The choice to take a gap year can reflect a desire to relax after high school, to give meaning and direction to later classroom experiences or to break away from a traditional or limited academic trajectory, according to Georgetown students who took the leap.
For Anne Jamison (SFS ’14), a gap year was a necessary break after four years at an intense high school.
“I really needed a break. … If I’d come to Georgetown straight from high school I would have been burned out,” she said.
After a year abroad as an outdoor education teaching assistant in Australia’s Victorian Alps, Jamison is taking 19 credits per semester in a curriculum inspired by her gap year.
“I had time to decompress and now I’m so excited to work. I came back so excited to start learning again,” Jamison said.
Gabriel Pincus (SFS ’14), who split his gap year between an Israel-based environmental studies program and a backpacking tour of Europe, said that a gap year was a way to break free of the life path students in the United States are expected to follow.
“America sets up this track that’s like a race. When you’re expected to stuff your résumé, go to college, go to law school and get your first job, when do you live anymore?” Pincus said.
Jake Sneeden (SFS ’12) devoted his time in between graduation and convocation to traveling in Australia and New Zealand.
“I knew I wanted to take a gap year my junior year in high school when I was reading Conrad’s ‘Heart of Darkness,’ and it sort of struck me that my experiences that I had had were not raw or powerful, but rather just repeating an old pattern, a worn path,” he wrote in an email.
Some who took gap years said their experiences have provided valuable insights that have enhanced their studies at Georgetown.
Zander Rounds (SFS ’14), who participated in an international development program in Ecuador, China, India and South Africa, said that his experiences have helped him contextualize what he is learning in the classroom.
“Let’s say I’m in [Map of the Modern World] and we’re talking about an issue in India. I’ve been there and seen it and worked with people and talked to people there. Having that context to draw on has enriched my academic experience,” Rounds said.
Pincus said that his year abroad sparked a new interest in sustainable international development, inspiring him to pursue the Science, Technology and International Affairs program at Georgetown.
“It’s very different from what I would have been doing, and I’m so glad for that,” he said.
Greg Miller (SFS ’14) spent a year in Blagoveshchensk, Russia, studying Russian at the local university. He said that his gap year instilled an intrepidness that has helped him to maximize his time at Georgetown.
“The most valuable thing I learned was to never say no, to always go out there and try new things. This has meant that at Georgetown I’ve taken advantage of so many opportunities and lived life to the fullest,” Miller said.
While students who took gap years were positive about their experiences, they highlighted several challenges and said that gap years may not be a good choice for every student. Pincus highlighted the obstacles of his living situation.
“Being a guest for months is a really hard thing. I had to be on my game all the time. It’s dangerous not to be,” Pincus said. “I think it’s true that gap years aren’t for everyone.”
Sneeden said that the wide array of challenges posed by different gap year experiences means anyone can select an experience that will keep him or her comfortable — but only those who want to make the most out of their gap years should take them, he said.
“I think gap years are for anyone who wants to do them, because there is so much variety to what you can do, but if you aren’t ambitious, plan poorly and just lose the year doing nothing, you’re obviously going to be miserable and not take anything away from it,” he said.
While students said the transition from their gap year to the freshman class at Georgetown went more smoothly than expected, they cited certain challenges.
Ivy Otradovec (COL ’14), who visited every continent but one during her gap year, found it difficult to adjust to the structured, regimented lifestyle at Georgetown after a year of freedom.
“I wasn’t used to having any routine or regime. If I loved it somewhere, I could chill there for a month. Suddenly I come here and there’s a random institution trying to enforce deadlines and routines and hours, right down to when the dining hall is open and closed. It seemed insane,” she said.
Pincus said that the contrast between the experiential learning of his gap year and day-to-day classroom life at Georgetown can prove
challenging.
“I get bouts of feeling that I’m not doing anything important here,” he said. “But there’s an absolute value in being in an academic setting, and I see classroom learning in a completely different way.”
Rounds said he was nervous about coming to Georgetown after a year spent without tests or exams, but the transition was smoother than expected because of the intensive nature of his gap year program.
“While I was traveling I had a pretty rigorous curriculum. I was reading as much as I am at Georgetown now, so I was prepared for the academics here,” he said.
Pincus expressed concern that gap years are presented as a less safe path than the traditional one, especially by high school guidance counselors, even if they yield positive results.
“What concerns me is that there are many more people who could manage taking a gap year and could benefit tremendously but don’t do it because guidance counselors in high school present it as a risk,” he said.
While Georgetown supported his decision to take a gap year, Pincus said universities should be more open in backing the option.
“Georgetown should recommend that incoming freshmen do gap years. It definitely doesn’t detract from the college experience at all. It actually adds to it so much,” Miller said.

The School of Foreign Service unveiled the Religion, Ethics and World Affairs Certificate, a new undergraduate certificate formed in conjunction with the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, on Friday.
The certificate, which will be available next semester, aims to address the role of religion in international affairs in a manner yet to be offered by other disciplines at Georgetown, according to Thomas Banchoff, the director of the Berkley Center and an associate professor in the government department and the SFS.
“Other majors and certificates explore international relations and particular religious traditions,” Banchoff wrote in an email. “But until now there [have] been none that [address] the religion-ethics-world affairs interface in a structured way.”
The Berkley Center plans to accept 15 applicants, eventually including those from schools outside the SFS, to the program each semester, according to Banchoff.
SFS students said that they are excited for the opportunity to incorporate a religious perspective into their undergraduate study of international relations.
“It’s about time that the SFS incorporated theology into its higher academic curriculum,” Ben Talus (SFS ’14) said.
According to Banchoff, recent world events — including the Arab-Israeli conflict, Muslim-Hindu relations in South Asia and the wars against Iraq, Afghanistan and terrorism — inspired the certificate.
The program has three academic concentrations: faith and ethics in international relations, religion and politics seen through a comparative perspective and religion in history and culture. Through these areas of study, the coursework will explore the role of religion in culture and domestic and international politics. Available classes will be offered through a variety of academic departments, including government, history, theology and international affairs.
“I see the certificate as a way to solidify our contribution to the undergraduate curriculum and deepen our collaboration with [the] SFS,” Banchoff wrote.
The certificate also includes an original research component organized through a capstone seminar led by Banchoff, who will work closely with the students. Possible topics include the connections between religion and ethics in relation to democracy and human rights, economic and social development and international security.
Seminar students will be required to present their research each spring at an annual colloquium and the winning body of work will be published on the certificate’s website.
The Berkley Center also hopes to create a sense of community for its certificate members through sponsored study breaks for students and lunch seminars with program faculty.
“The Berkley Center thrives on close faculty-student collaboration in research, outreach and teaching,” Banchoff wrote. “Informal interaction through study breaks and lunches can complement the work we do together in the classroom.”
Jaclyn Markowitz (SFS ’14) viewed the creation of the certificate as a logical step for the SFS.
“A lot of times I think people underestimate the effect of religion in other culture,” Markowitz said. “If Georgetown has such strong government, international affairs and theology departments, why not combine them?”

As the community prepares to remember the violence of the Sept.11th terrorist attacks, students and faculty will close discussions in a conference designed to highlight recent successes and challenges in conflict resolution.
“Students in part will get this lesson: Peace is not something that comes easily. It is something that we have to work toward,” said Fathali Moghaddam, director of the Master of Arts in Conflict Resolution program.
“From Conflict to Peace: Innovative Approaches to Peacebuilding,” which was organized jointly by the Conflict Resolution program and the Office of the President, is the first conference of its kind at Georgetown. Moghaddam said it has been extremely successful, with several hundred people registered.
“Conflict resolution is so well-matched to the Georgetown institution,” he said.
The conference was designed to highlight successes in recent peace-building, such as South Africa and Northern Ireland. Challenges in the Middle East also dominated conference discussions.
“It’s a very important time for the Middle East,” Moghaddam said. “We see opportunities coming, but we also see great dangers.”
Moghaddam said he hoped the conference’s success would draw more attention to the Conflict Resolution Program that opened its doors six years ago and now has 75 graduate students enrolled.
“One of our goals is to bring more students into conflict resolution,” Moghaddam said, adding that he especially wanted to raise awareness of opportunities for undergraduate students.
Students who helped organize the conference said they are especially excited for today’s speaker panel, which will feature students from Georgetown and around the world. Among the topics are a discussion on sports and peace and one featuring students from Queen’s University in Belfast who will discuss the Irish peace process based on their own experiences.
“It’s going to be very exciting to hear the results of very recent research in all these areas,” Amanda Munroe (GRD ’12) said.
Kaitlyn Allen (GRD ’12), who also helped organize the conference, said that the panelists like Robi Damelin — a widely known advocate and member of Parents Circle, which is an organization for bereaved Palestinian and Israeli parents — were the highlight of the conference for her.
“We’ve all studied her work, in essence,” Allen said.
Damelin, whose son was shot by a sniper while serving in the Israeli Army, said she thought it was important to engage in dialogue with those from opposing sides of an issue.
“On the contrary, I’m happy to talk to people who disagree with me because I feel it’s important to plant a seed,” she said. “We don’t have a monopoly on truth.”

At her newly opened martial arts studio near Metro Center, Luminous Warrior founder and owner Sara Salam (GRD ’01) is combining self-defense and healing practices to empower clients to push themselves beyond their physical limits.
The studio offers a range of classes for clients with varying levels of abilities and interests.
“This is an amazing place, you just have to step in and try it out,” Salam said.
Salam became interested in self-defense because of safety concerns that stemmed from her time living alone in D.C. as she completed her MBA on the Hilltop.
“Living alone, studying late at night and having to walk home, hearing about women being attacked, date rape, rape drugs and the like, I wanted to learn more about self-defense and how I could empower myself to stay safe and learn to fight back if I ever had to,” Salam said.
After experimenting with several styles of self-defense, she decided to learn Krav Maga, a self-defense system first developed in Israel that relies on participants’ leverage, instead of their strength or size.
Luminous Warrior’s clients include mostly young professionals and college students.
A typical class at Luminous Warrior includes a warm-up, combative-style punching and kicking techniques, and drills to practice the techniques such as headlocks in a co-ed class and breathing exercises.
Salam said that she wishes to empower her clients and help them believe that they can defend themselves in any situation.
“Kickboxing is more about a workout. [Self-defense] is more about confrontation and if you can knock [your opponent] out,” Salam said. “Choosing to fight is an option. Self-defense gives you that option.”
Salam also believes that college students can benefit from her classes.
“Many college students are out on their own for the very first time. Luminous Warrior … provides self-defense, safety and risk reduction training,” she said. “It also offers a community in which college students will be able to pursue their own paths, void of peer pressure or other people’s opinion.”
Encouraged by the success of Luminous Warrior, Salam hopes to expand her business and services in the future.
“I think big all the time. My goal is always to be a service. What we offer is a service enough to have a very large group and absolutely we will grow,” she said.

Combining comedy with social commentary, award-winning Arab-American comedian Dean Obeidallah spoke Friday about his mission to counter stereotypes with humor Friday.
“In America, we have a great tradition of using comedy to raise social and political issues,” he said.
Half-Palestinian, half-Sicilian and New Jersey-raised, Obeidallah has an unconventional background. He said that the Sept. 11 attacks gave him a new perspective on his own upbringing and how it relates to the world around him.
“My life changed with 9/11,” Obeidallah said. “I was a white guy before 9/11, and after, I was an Arab.”
Along with this revelation came a new take on comedy. Perceiving a growth of “Islamophobia,” or anti-Muslim sentiment, Obeidallah said he uses his shows to try to promote understanding.
“I don’t like calling it ‘Islamophobia’ — it sounds like a cute disease,” Obeidallah said. “It’s a hate movement. We have to go out and counter that hate.”
By touring the United States and the Middle East, Obeidallah said he has reached out to people of all cultural and ethnic backgrounds.
“I think what makes Dean stand out is how he takes away that veil of ignorance through a very humanizing approach,” said Cynthia Schneider, professor in the School of Foreign Service and moderator of the Q-and-A session.
Attendee Julia Tanaka (SFS ’15) said she appreciated Obeidallah’s unique take on social issues.
“Often, politicians are afraid to say what’s right because of the political capital at stake, and this is a fantastic way to truly address what needs to be addressed,” she said.
Benjamin Nickl, a graduate student pursuing his Ph.D. with the SFS and the McDonough School of Business, said Obeidallah’s talk related well to his budding dissertation on ethnic comedy.
“We have the same kind of conflict going on in Germany and all over the globe,” said Nickl.
Obeidallah has taken his brand of comedy to countries including Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, Oman, Israel, Qatar and Dubai. After performing shows for audiences in these countries, he always conducted free comedy workshops to help local comics.
Though Obeidallah recognizes the importance of countering the anti-Muslim sentiment, he also finds it difficult to quantify his success.
“People always ask if I’m making a change, and I say ‘I don’t know,'” Obeidallah said. “But I would rather take a chance and try to change something than sit back and not try at all.”
“I think with Dean, you see the combination of creativity, intelligence and humor that goes with comedy,” Schneider said. “And you see why in some ways, comedy is uniquely positioned to take on issues of anti-Muslim sentiment. I think that’s the humanizing element.”
Obeidallah said he continues his work in hope that his comedic approach encourages people from all around the world to become increasingly tolerant and willing to learn about each other.
“Some people I met in my southern tours had never met a Muslim in their lives,” Obeidallah said. “Teaching you something without trivializing it — that’s the type of comedy I aspire to.”

As students rush around the corner toward the Leavey Center Starbucks and Cosi, they may notice that a once-deserted space has undergone a spiritual awakening.
Makóm, a new Jewish gathering area located along one of Leavey’s main thoroughfares, is a sign of wider changes at work for the Jewish Chaplaincy and Hillel. Just in time for the observance of Yom Kippur this weekend, Jewish students have seen an uptick in campus awareness and university support for their faith community.
“Many of my friends from home found it slightly odd that I was going to a Jesuit school, considering the fact that I am Jewish,” Randi Lawrence (SFS ’15) said. “But I have found the Jewish community here both very welcoming and surprisingly active. It is so comforting to see so many fellow students show up to Shabbat services each Friday — it makes me feel like I belong.”
Jewish Student Association Co-President Samantha Sisskind (SFS ’12), who has been involved in Jewish student organizations since her freshman year, echoed this sentiment.
“[The Jewish community] is a feeling of home within Georgetown,” she said. “It’s been very significant to my experience over the last several years.”
While the chaplaincy operated for many years out of a rented townhouse on 36th Street, the new, centrally located Makóm has already upped attendance at many JSA events, according to Sisskind.
“It’s central, it’s beautiful and it’s big. Students are thrilled about it and see it as a major statement of support [from the university],” Rabbi Rachel Gartner said of the area.
The new space is the latest development in a trend of rising university backing of the Jewish ministry on campus. In 2010, the university agreed to help foot the cost of renting the JSA townhouse — which had formerly been funded by donations — after students called on the university to address the chaplaincy’s tightened budget and capacity.
Makóm’s location is only temporary, as Jewish student space will eventually form part of the new Interfaith Center, set for completion in the next several years. According to Gartner, the finished project will contain spaces for the Muslim and Jewish communities, as well as multi-purpose space and a kosher kitchen.
The construction of the Interfaith Center will knock out the hallway connecting Hoya Court to Cosi and Starbucks, and a new diagonal hallway will take its place. According to previous statements from the Office of Mission and Ministry, the timeline on renovations will depend on financing sources and contributions.
In conjunction with the fresh space in Leavey, the Jewish Chaplaincy has a new leader this year in Rabbi Rachel Gartner. Appointed last spring, the New York native’s life journey has been rooted in her faith.
“I grew up in a family where my mother was really into Reform Judaism, and my father was very, very committed as a cultural Jew,” she said.
Gartner explained that her deeply ingrained beliefs were challenged in college when she had difficulty answering friends’ questions about her traditions and faith. She knew, however, that she wanted to be able to respond. This search for answers led Gartner to Israel, where she lived for nearly two years. It was during her time there that she decided to attend Rabbinical school.
Now at Georgetown after her most recent posting as Miami University of Ohio’s rabbi and executive director of Hillel, Gartner has been more than welcomed by students of the Jewish community.
“She brings a whole new energy. Rabbi Rachel is a big part of the new robust community that we now have,” Sisskind said.
Gartner is only the second permanent rabbi to lead the Jewish chaplaincy on campus. The first, Rabbi Harold White, retired last year after more than 40 years of service. He remains a member of the faculty in the Program for Jewish Civilization.
When White came to campus in 1968, however, Georgetown became the first Catholic university to hire a full-time rabbi.
He originally established the chaplaincy in order to increase interfaith understanding and provide a sense of community for Jewish students.
“There’s something wonderfully mysterious that occurs at Georgetown,” he said. “The connections being established between religions, spirituality and public policy — I believe that these are very important.”
According to White, the first Jewish students graduated in 1954, but it was not until the mid-1960s that he saw a noticeable rise in the number of Jewish students on the Hilltop.
White credits the leadership of President Edward Bunn, S.J., namesake of the Bunn Intercultural Center, for increasing the Jewish presence on campus.
“Bunn asked a prominent D.C. rabbi to join the university’s board of directors. From there, his focus on recruiting more Jewish students was quite evident.”
When White arrived on the Hilltop, the JSA had already begun to establish itself as a presence after a year on campus.
“We hosted Friday night Shabbat and dinners in the rented JSA house off campus,” White said. “It was a very active program.”
White estimated that 12 to 14 percent of the current student body identifies as Jewish and that these students strongly feel the need to exhibit their religious identity.
“At Penn and other schools with 35 percent Jewish students, you don’t need to do anything to show your religious identity,” he said. “Being in the minority, you have to, or you lose that identity.”
White’s goal of inspiring a sense of Jewish solidarity has been fully realized, according to JSA Vice President of Religious Affairs Eric Hoerger (SFS ’12).
“The Jewish community has contributed a great deal to the phenomenal experience that I’ve had on the Hilltop” he said. “The benefits to such a community extend well beyond the religious aspect itself. I’ve met an amazing group of friends who met via the organization but have grown to be defined by common interests as well.”
For White, the university cannot hope to meet the needs of many Jewish students until a kosher kitchen is a reality.
“Once we have a kosher option, the number of Orthodox students will rise,” he said.
For now, the new space is a welcome fresh start for the new year.
“The new Jewish space has given us the opportunity to be a much more visible presence on campus,” Hoerger said. “For the first time, we can comfortably seat 30 to 40 students for Shabbat services. We also have a lot more opportunities with programming and storage. Overall, it’s been great.”
This sense of welcome is exactly what Gartner hopes the Jewish community will foster in its members and guests.
“It’s an incredible opportunity to stretch and to learn. That’s the gift of being a small, diverse community,” she said.

John J. DeGioia (CAS ’79) stepped modestly up to the podium a decade ago to address over 2,000 faculty, staff, students and alumni gathered there to honor him.
“Good afternoon, and thank you. It is a profound honor to accept this responsibility today as the 48th president of Georgetown University,” the newly inaugurated president said.
Ten years later, DeGioia has overseen the largest expansion of campus facilities in university history. From establishing auxiliary campuses both across the river in Virginia and halfway around the globe in the Middle East, to overseeing an over 50 percent growth in the university endowment and strengthening many of its academic disciplines from business to regional studies, DeGioia has left his mark on the past decade.
“President DeGioia’s leadership has built upon the foundations of excellence and strategic growth that his predecessors have laid down,” said Dan Porterfield (CAS ’83), a close friend to DeGioia and former senior vice president for strategic development.
LOOKING OUT FROM WITHIN
Much about DeGioia is unique in Georgetown history. He is the first lay president of a Jesuit university in America, breaking the line of 47 ordained predecessors. Consequently, he is the first to have a family of his own, with his wife, Theresa, and young son, J.T.
“He really was a major forerunner in showing the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities that a layperson could lead a Catholic institution with fidelity to its religious mission,” Porterfield said.
Despite the non-traditional choice by the board of directors, DeGioia gained the backing of the majority of the community almost immediately; his reputation as a deft administrator preceded him.
Porterfield recalled that there was unanimity among the Jesuits on the board of directors about the choice.
“Fr. Brian McDermont, S.J., said at the time, speaking for the Jesuits on the board of directors, that they believed Jack DeGioia was a ‘providential decision for the next president,'” Porterfield said.
Before his appointment, DeGioia had spent his entire professional life on the Hilltop. After receiving his diploma in 1979, he took a job as hall director in New South Hall. In 1982, he began work as an assistant to former University President Timothy S. Healy, S.J.
He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming dean of student affairs as a 28-year-old in 1985. He was appointed associate vice president and chief administrative officer for the main campus in 1992.
In 1998, former University President Leo J. O’Donovan, S.J. (CAS ’56), put him in charge of fixing the finances of Georgetown University Medical Center, giving DeGioia the title of senior vice president.
Three years later, when it came time for a search committee to choose the next president of the nation’s oldest Catholic university, its members settled on DeGioia. Leaders were impressed with his work negotiating a complex financial deal to sell the clinical operations of GUMC to MedStar while retaining the academic institution of the medical school.
DeGioia’s long tenure on the Hilltop also made him a logical fit for a leader.
“He came to the job with exquisite experience. … I think at the time of his election he knew more about Georgetown University than anyone but God,” Fr. Otto Hentz, S.J., said.
In-depth knowledge of his alma mater gave him the ability to manage and transform the institution effectively. But Special Assistant to the President for China Affairs Dennis McManus, S.J., commented that over 35 years at Georgetown has not boxed in DeGioia’s perspective. Hentz agreed.
“People wondered that since all his years had been at Georgetown, he might be narrowly focused, but the opposite is just the case,” Hentz said. “His vision is very broad.”
According to Hentz, one of DeGioia’s greatest strengths is his hiring of quality staff to manage the complex operations of the university.
“My impression is that he’s an effective administrator because he hires effective administrators. What amazes me is how much he is on top of all that’s going on at the university,” he said.
PRESERVING A JESUIT IDENTITY
Ten years later it seems that any question of DeGioia’s commitment to the university’s Jesuit and Catholic identity has all but disappeared. According to McManus, of all the achievements the president has made over his 10 years, one of the greatest has been the strengthening and rejuvenation of Georgetown’s Jesuit character.
Current Vice President of Mission and Ministry Kevin O’Brien, S.J. (COL ’88), agreed that DeGioia has carried on the founding principles of the university.
“He has been very intentional about promoting the Catholic and Jesuit character,” O’Brien said.
Hentz explained that, being Jesuits, many of DeGioia’s predecessors became complacent with the school’s identity.
“In the ’50s and even the ’60s, we sort of took it for granted. There’s no cruise control in these matters,” he said. “In some ways, his commitment to the Catholic, Jesuit identity of Georgetown is more impressive precisely because he is not a Jesuit.”
As the first lay president, DeGioia engaged actively in promoting the ideals of the order. He instituted seminars on Ignatian spirituality for senior administrators and the Board of Trustees to help teach the leaders of Georgetown what it meant to be a Catholic and Jesuit university.
In 2003, DeGioia instituted the Office of Mission and Ministry to augment his efforts to preserve the university’s spiritual heritage. He has consistently chosen a Jesuit to fill that role — the singular priest in the senior administration hierarchy.
Those close to DeGioia emphasized that he personally is deeply ingrained in the Catholic spirituality of the order. He has twice made the full 30-day journey of the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises, the backbone of Jesuit spirituality, according to O’Brien.
Out of his active pursuit of the university’s traditional heritage has come an enhanced commitment to interreligious dialogue. Under DeGioia, multiple conferences have drawn religious leaders from around the world to campus to discuss global faith interactions and understanding.
He also makes a trip to Rome every year to meet with the superior general of the Society of Jesus, the leader of the Jesuits, as well as leaders from the Vatican. Stemming from his conversations with Jesuit leaders have come some of his plans for Georgetown’s international engagement.
“Our education must be put in service to the world,” O’Brien said. “It is both our goal and our way of operating.”
LEADING AN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
The extension of the university into the global sphere has been one of the most significant developments of DeGioia’s term. Porterfield drew a connection between DeGioia’s work worldwide to former President Healy’s work nationally. Healy is credited with transforming Georgetown from a local institution to a national center of higher education. Porterfield said DeGioia engineered a similar change from a national to international university.
The past 10 years have seen an unprecedented increase in international engagement. Georgetown opened a branch of its School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar in 2005. It has made key investments in partnerships with both India and Israel, as well as in China, a process that culminated in a high-profile trip by the men’s basketball team to that country this summer.
McManus noted that DeGioia’s work in the international sphere presented a vastly different set of challenges from Healy’s national development.
“It’s a very different world. It’s a very diverse world,” McManus said. “When you try to go global you not only have the issue of languages, but you have discrepancies in levels of socioeconomic development.”
Porterfield postulated that the university still had a lot to discover about its international engagement.
“It’s not clear what will define institutions as global,” Porterfield said. “Out of a sheer force of conviction that it would empower Georgetown … for future generations to develop global relationships now … he was committed to building the relationship because he saw the long-term strategic value.”
“A different president might not have chosen to do that work,” Porterfield added.
GROWTH ON THE HOMEFRONT
Back on the main campus, DeGioia has overseen impressive growth on the Hilltop. With the building of the Southwest Quad, Rafik B. Hariri Building, Davis Performing Arts Center and the under-construction New Science Center, Georgetown will complete the largest expansion of campus facilities in university history.
Overall university property has also expanded significantly with the opening of the Qatar campus, the Clarendon location for the School of Continuing Studies and the groundbreaking for the Calcagnini Contemplative Center in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Porterfield said that the new space has drastically improved student life on campus.
“[The expansion of facilities] drastically enhances the university’s competitiveness,” he said.
Under DeGioia’s leadership, the U.S. News and World Report ranking has stayed fairly constant from 23 in 2001 to 22 in 2011, rising to 21 at its highest. He also worked extensively to shore up university finances in order to facilitate the university’s growth.
“Clearly his focus in stabilizing the financial platform of the university has been a priority,” said Erik Smulson, vice president for public affairs and senior adviser to the president. “It gave confidence to some of our alumni and donors that we would be a good manager of the funds that they were willing to give us.”
In 2004, the university created the Investment Office and appointed a the first chief investment officer to oversee the growth of Georgetown’s endowment.
Since DeGioia took office in 2001, the endowment has grown over 50 percent to top $1 billion. This remains modest with respect to peer institutions, but growth continues to offset operating costs and provide additional financial stability.
Under DeGioia, a $1 billion fundraising campaign was completed in 2003. At the end of this month, another $1.5 billion capital campaign, which has already hit its halfway mark, will enter its public phase.
Solidifying the financial base was necessary for one of DeGioia’s other main priorities to become possible: Meeting the full need of all applicants, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.
“The first pillar of the [capital] campaign is scholarships,” Smulson said. “He recognizes that making institutions of higher education affordable for students from all economic backgrounds is a key priority.”
ENGAGING WITH THE COMMUNITY
Amid the turmoil of the ongoing campus plan battle, DeGioia has experience on his side.
This is his second time as president encountering opposition from the surrounding community. He inherited a contentious situation with the 2000 Campus Plan, which was ultimately resolved in court in 2003. He also played a significant role in his position as a senior administrator during the 1990 Campus Plan proceedings.
The DeGioia administration has made a conscious effort to play a positive role in the District and its surrounding areas. “Our engagement in the city … has never been greater,” Smulson said.
According to Smulson, both the construction of the Southwest Quadrangle, which allowed more students to live in campus residences, and the Ward 7 initiative, which is a partnership between Georgetown and the Meyers Institute for College Prep, have been significant investments in improving neighborhood relations.
But for all his work at Georgetown and around the globe, many administrators emphasize a single point: DeGioia’s commitment to the undergraduate experience.
“His ability to translate to faculty and senior leaders why we value the development of undergraduates … has very significantly affected choices that senior leaders make in how to respond to student needs,” Porterfield said.
DeGioia has remained active in the academy, teaching an Ignatius Seminar for freshmen in the College. According to Smulson, who served as his chief of staff for four years, his class and weekly office hours are some of the most important events on his calendar.
However, some students feel that DeGioia could engage more on campus.
Brad Hilson (COL ’12) echoed that sentiment. “I never see him on campus. I’ve been here for three and a half years now and I never see him … I don’t think he’s a very student-oriented person.”
A JUGGLING ACT
For a university president, however, the job is much more than just community relations and fundraising campaigns. Those close to him say that the non-stop commitment takes its toll and that DeGioia doesn’t give an inch.
“There is no person in this university, not one, who would ever tell you that when they were working with President DeGioia, they worked harder than him,” Porterfield said. “He has been a servant-leader in the role of president in support of Georgetown University and its people.”

The Iranians who allegedly plotted to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States were aware that their plan to bomb a D.C. restaurant could cause mass casualties.
Their response: “If the hundred go with him, [expletive] ‘em.”
After the foiled plot was announced, rumors spread that the likely target was high-end restaurant Cafe Milano — located just seven blocks from the front gates on Prospect Street near Wisconsin Avenue.
Two men, one an Iranian-born U.S. citizen and the second reportedly associated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, were accused of plotting the assassination of Saudi ambassador Adel al-Jubeir (GRD ’84). This summer, the pair approached a man they thought was a Mexican drug cartel associate, but who was, in fact, an undercover U.S. informant. The Iranian-American was arrested Sept. 29 and plans to plead not guilty to the charges.
At the time of the arrest, the assassins had allegedly finalized their plans to use a C-4 explosive to bomb a restaurant that the ambassador was known to frequent twice a week, according to records taken by the informant. U.S. authorities have also said that the Israeli embassy could have been a secondary target.
An assassin was quoted as saying that collateral damage extending to roughly 150 people in the surrounding area would be “no big deal.”
For some Georgetown students, the likely proximity of the planned attack changes their perspective on safety in D.C.
“It’s almost unbelievable,” said Tim Devita (COL ’14). “We don’t really realize that we are in the U.S. capital, and we’re reminded that it is a high security risk to live here.”
Cafe Milano is well-known as a hotspot for Washington insiders. Multiple reports have suggested that it was the target, although the restaurant is never explicitly mentioned in legal documents. A manager at Cafe Milano said he did not know if the restaurant was targeted.
“It’s a little scary,” said Krista Engemann (COL ’13) upon hearing the news. She remarked that she felt reminded of what it was like to live in New York City during the 9/11 attacks.
A worker at Tuscany Cafe, a pizzeria on the same block as Cafe Milano, expressed shock upon hearing how close the explosion could have been to his workplace. The employee, who asked not to be identified, said that such news in Washington is more frightening than the persistent threat of danger he once experienced living through a foreign civil war.
John Collins (COL ’14) said he has a different perspective from having grown up in New York City and experiencing terrorist threats.
“You got to live life, right?” Collins said. “I’m pretty confident in our homeland security, and there are plots all the time.”

Congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) spoke about human rights and the stability of Israeli democracy in Copley Formal Lounge Monday night.
Frank has represented Massachussetts’ fourth congressional district since 1980 and is the first openly gay member of Congress. His speech was the first event in Israel Week, which is sponsored by the College Democrats and J Street U Georgetown. The talk was also sponsored by the Georgetown Israel Alliance and GU Pride.
Frank underscored his support for a sustainable peace process for Israel and Palestine and the importance of a continued friendship between the United States and Israel.
“[From] every value that I have gone into politics to pursue and protect … out of any state in the Middle East, Israel comes closest to that.”
Frank also said he recognized the need for better treatment of Arab settlers and citizens within the Israeli state.
“It is entirely legitimate to say Israel has made mistakes, but the obstacle to peace right now is not Israel, it is Hamas,” he said.
Calling Israel the most open democracy in the Middle East, Frank pointed to the country’s support for women’s and gay rights. He said that Israel’s democratic success countered the notion that democracy is only sustainable in safe regions.
“Israel has spent its entire existence at war and is one of the most important democracies in the world,” he said.

Congressman Jared Polis (D-Colo.) discussed the current Arab-Israeli conflict and potential solutions to the problem Tuesday.
The event was sponsored by the Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown Israel Alliance, GU Pride and J Street U Georgetown. As a part of Israel Issues Week, the discussion was designed to increase awareness about the situation in the Middle East.
In his talk, Polis stressed the need for a peaceful two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. He proposed the restoration of Israel’s 1967 borders and a series of land swaps to formally establish boundaries between Israel and Palestine.
“The land is really one of the easy impediments,” Polis said.
According to the congressman, the more serious barriers are irresolvable claims to power within the region, because both Palestine and Israel feel entitled to the land.
Polis also discussed the need to continue providing American aid to Israel.
“This would be a very dangerous time to zero out foreign aid,” Polis said. “It’s the job of many of us Democrats in the room to hold the Republican’s feet to the fire on their sensibly pro-Israel policies when they talk about zeroing out foreign aid to Israel.”
He added that the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran, which would further disrupt the unstable forces in the area and threaten international security, is a primary concern for the United States and Israel.
The lecture was also an opportunity to raise awareness about Georgetown’s recently established chapter of J Street U, a national organization that seeks to increase understanding of Israeli issues and promote a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Jason Gerson (SFS ’14), chapter co-president, believes that support for this organization is particularly important for Georgetown.
“I think that particularly Georgetown has a very strong interest and investment in what happens in regions outside of our own, which include the Middle East,” he said. “[There is a general] consensus that concessions on both sides are needed and that a peaceful resolution in this conflict isimperative.”

In a city where over 3,500 aggravated assault offenses were reported in 2010, Georgetown and its student groups are stepping up efforts to ensure that community members are better prepared to deal with instances of violent crime.
The university offers self-defense courses through the Department of Public Safety and Yates Field House as its primary means of preventative education. The classes teach both physical and nonphysical ways to thwart attacks.
Since the 1970s, Yates has offered a judo program, which brings in black-belt experts to instruct participants of any skill level or gender. In the past, Yates offered gender-specific women’s self-defense classes, but the program was cut due to the difficulty of finding time and space to conduct the program.
Similarly, the Georgetown Israel Alliance has brought instructors to campus to teach Krav Maga, the self-defense program used by the Israeli Defense Forces. The group is planning to publicize future events for the program more widely.
“Krav Maga is very applicable,” club president Ben Talus (SFS ’14) said. “It can be used if you are walking down the streets of D.C.”
DPS offers a gender-specific self-defense training program, Rape Aggression Defense. RAD is a 12-hour course that aims to supply female students, faculty and staff with the necessary skills to defend themselves in the event of sexual assault.
RAD is a crucial component of the larger programs offered to support students, according to JenSchweer, the sexual assault and relationship violence services coordinator with Health Education Services.
“The RAD program offered by DPS is a piece of a comprehensive approach in talking about safety issues,” Schweer said. “Education, awareness, survivor services and perpetrator accountability are also critical parts of the process. We need all of these pieces in order to fully address the issue of violence.”
But Mike Balsan (COL ’12), president of GU Men of Strength, worries that an emphasis on such programs may have unintended consequences. Laura Kovach, director of the Georgetown University Women’s Center, shares his concern.
“Self-defense may be effective, but focusing on self-defense puts the onus of protection on the victim, not the perpetrator,” Kovach said. “We believe that self-defense is only one component of a comprehensive approach to addressing gender-based violence. One thing we stress is that even if you take a self-defense workshop and you experience an assault, it’s not your fault. No matter what, it’s never the victim’s fault.”
Balsan’s group, formerly known as GU Men Creating Change, seeks to foster a campus environment where self-defense is not considered a necessity. In order to address the root causes of violence against women, Men of Strength offers bystander intervention workshops. The workshops, which take place in small groups in residence halls, bring in professional facilitators from the nonprofit organization Men Can Stop Rape. Participants learn strategies to diffuse situations and distract perpetrators as well as basic crisis management skills to assist victims after an attack.
“You should not feel like you have to know self-defense or have to buy mace,” Balsan said.
In honor of Women’s History Month, the Women’s Center also plans to hold a self-defense workshop open to all genders in March.

Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dennis Ross spoke about the Arab Spring and its implications for the Middle East in an event sponsored by the Program for Jewish Civilization on Thursday.
Ross, who has served as an advisor to Presidents Bush, Clinton and Obama, joked about his bipartisan career.
“I spent a long time working with Arabs and Israelis; I figured I might as well work with Republicans and Democrats,” he said.
His lecture, titled “The Arab Awakening and Its Implications,” focused on the events in the Middle East, describing them as an ongoing awakening rather than a fleeting spring, and the future of Iran and Israeli-Palestinian relations.
“It may not have been easily predictable when this would take place, but it was predictable that if change came, Islamists were going to have all the advantages in the early going,” he said.
Ross explained that the environment created by rulers like Hosni Mubarak, former Egyptian politician and military leader, resulted in all organized resistance occurring in mosques, separate from the secular arena.
Ross also discussed steps that Israel and Palestine both must take in order to achieve peace, relating the conflict to events in the broader Arab world.
“Both on the Arab Awakening and the issue of peace, the circumstances are dramatically different than they have been, but there is always something to be done. And only when you decide there is nothing to be done do you make that a self-fulfilling prophecy,” he said.
Students who attended the lecture were pleased by Ross’s foreign policy expertise.
“I’m a total standard SFS nerd and I followed Ross before I came here, so I was very excited,” CharlyJaffe (SFS ’13) said.

The Office of Residence Life approved plans to institute a Jewish Living Learning Community on Wednesday.
Dubbed Bayit — “home” in Hebrew — the program is the10th Living Learning Community at Georgetown and will become an option on housing applications for next fall. The LLC’s future location is still unknown.
According to Mitchel Hochberg (SFS ’15), who spearheaded the project, the LLC aims to provide a hub for Jewish life on campus.
The idea emerged after Hochberg had a casual conversation with a friend from the Muslim Interest LLC.
“[He] told me, ‘Why don’t you guys start one of these?’” Hochberg said. “We joked around a bit, but I started to really consider it after the conversation.”
Hochberg observed that despite the prevalence of student groups and initiatives dedicated to Jewish interests — the Jewish Student Association, the Georgetown Israel Alliance, the Jewish Chaplaincy and the Program for Jewish Civilization — there is no defined home for Jewish students on campus.
“It’s taking a community that exists [and] really centralizing it, [creating] a hub for its activities and a residential dimension,” Hochberg said.
Jewish Student Association Co-President Isaac Mishlove (SFS ’15) said that the LLC will facilitate the exchange of information between Jewish student groups.
“There is a lot of redundancy that happens when you look at a wall and you have a PJC poster, a JSA poster, a chaplaincy poster. … When anyone looks at it, all of them blend together,” Mishlove said. “I think it will be a good space for people that are involved in different groups to have a lot more transparency on what’s going on in different aspects of Jewish-related life on campus.”
Hochberg distinguished Bayit from other LLCs by pointing out that it will meet the needs of an already well-developed group.
“It is unique among the other Living Learning Communities because it’s not creating a community in the same way that some of the other ones are,” Hochberg said. “It serves a function for an existing community that was not served before.”
However, Mishlove expressed concern that the LLC, which can accommodate only a limited number of students, will potentially create an exclusive group.
“Initially, I thought it was going to be a divider for Jewish students on campus. I still [have] that hesitation,” Mishlove said. “Because we come from so many places, [have] so many ways of practicing [and] so many mixes of students identify as Jewish in different ways … unity is a thing we need to work on.”
As with other LLCs, interested students can apply to live in the space, but Hochberg said that those who follow the kashrut, a set of strict Jewish dietary laws, will be given priority.
“It will be a lot easier for prospective students who are very observant [of] Jewish dietary laws to come to Georgetown if they [have] an environment like this,” Hochberg said.
Mishlove said he anticipates that Bayit will attract students who already are involved in Jewish leadership positions on campus.
“The names that would be going into this lottery would be pretty predictable already,” Mishlove said.
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner, the faculty adviser for Bayit, said the LLC will provide more opportunities for Georgetown’s Jewish students.
“For folks that want a slightly more intensive cultural experience and holistic experience of living a Jewish life, this will be a great opportunity,” Gartner said.

After a U.S. District Judge Mary Collyer ruled that anti-jihad advertisements be immediately installed in D.C. Metro stations last Friday, Georgetown students have launched a protest against the decision.
The anti-Muslim ads, which read, “In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad,” were paid for by the American Freedom Defense Initiative.
The Associated Press quoted David Yerushalmi, a lawyer representing the AFDI, Oct. 5. “The result is absolutely correct,” Yerushalmi said. “There simply was no way under the First Amendment jurisprudence that we have today that this ad should not have gone up when contracted.”
A petition against the ads created by Nabeel Zewail (SFS ’15) and Saaliha Khan (COL ’13) has garnered 1,618 signatures since it was first circulated Oct. 1.
“The United States was founded on the principle of tolerance and respect for all faith traditions; therefore, it is important that the D.C. Metro takes a strong stand,” the petition reads. “[The students of Georgetown University] feel that these ads have no place in the subway system of our nation’s capital.”
The D.C. Subway Commission temporarily postponed the installment of the ads last week in light of the violence incited by the release of “Innocence of Muslims,” a 14-minute video posted on YouTube Sept. 12 that insulted the Prophet Muhammad.
In response, the AFDI sued the D.C. transit system. The case went to the D.C. District Court, where a judge ruled that the postponement violated the AFDI’s right to free speech. Since then, the advertisements have been posted in four Metro stations, where they will hang for one month.
Zewail said he will continue to work against the installation of the ads despite the court’s ruling.
“Obviously, we are disappointed with the outcome of the case and wished the D.C. Metro would not post these hateful ads, but we are currently planning a response,” Zewail said. “We are focused on two goals: one, to continue to work to try to get the signs down and two, to counter their message of hate with a positive one about Islam and Muslims.”
Zewail and Khan have tabled in Red Square, advertised on Facebook and solicited the help of the Interfaith Council and the Muslim Students Association to promote their cause.
“I think, as a Catholic and person of faith, it’s important for us to stand up to this no matter what community is scapegoated,” Jordan Denari (SFS ’13), co-president of the Interfaith Council and practicing Catholic, said. “What we are realizing is that it is really our responsibility to step up and address this.”

Let’s get this straight: Mitt Romney is not George Bush.

One of the Obama campaign’s main methods of vilifyingGov. Romney has been to conflate the two. Furthermore, Bush has become Obama’s go-to excuse for all problems the United States faces today.
The country is embroiled in the quagmire that is the Middle East. Of course that is Bush’s fault; he did begin two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Never mind the fact that Bush was the first president since Franklin Roosevelt to have to contend with the momentous crisis of an attack within American borders. Bush led this country through a time of extraordinary uncertainty and fear.
 
Hindsight is 20/20. We might not like the state of U.S. relations with the Middle East today, but let’s not forget that when Bush sent troops to Iraq in 2003, his approval ratings were at a record high. An argument that he went against the will of the American people is far fetched.
 
The Obama campaign compares Romney with Bush not only to inject doubt into the voter’s mind about the Republican candidate’s foreign relations ability but also to distract Americans from the fact that Obama himself has not been very successful in the Middle East.
 
Yes, Obama ended the Iraq War and has been drawing down troops in Afghanistan. But there is considerable doubt as to whether stability will remain — or if it’s even been there to begin with. Rushing to exit from an indisputably undesired situation may cost the United States more in the long run. We should have finished what we started rather than leaving loose ends untied. Furthermore, Obama has proven that his diplomatic abilities are limited by not interfacing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who would be a crucial ally against a nuclear-armed Iran.
 
Ask Obama about why the economy is in the toilet, and you’ll hear that that is Bush’s fault, too. He put two costly wars on a credit card. On top of that, he cut taxes on the wealthy.
 
Both of those claims are true, even if Republicans describe them differently. However, by keeping this memory fresh in the electorate’s mind, Obama is once again trying to downplay his only failures and poor decisions regarding the economy.
 
One would be remiss to ignore the fact that the Obama administration advocated and rammed through Congress a multi-billion-dollar stimulus package that did not bring a fraction of the change that was promised. The economy is still sluggish, with unemployment remaining just below 8 percent.
According to Obama-logic, there aren’t shortcomings or failures of the current administration — it’s just Bush’s fault. And if you elect Romney in November, you are just electing another Bush.
 
Ladies and gentlemen, Republicans and Democrats: Do not be deceived by this.
 
I am no Bush apologist, but there is a point at which blaming the previous president and his administration for all of the country’s woes becomes absurd.
 
The Obama administration is not without its own shortcomings and failures. These faults would be much more forgivable if the president was to take responsibility for them. But he does not.
Voters should hold their candidates accountable to their successes and failures alike. Assess them on both their shortcomings and their merits. Obama dispossesses the former to compensate for the latter. That is not a candidate who deserves a second term.

Mark Stern argued in his column “No Suppression of Stupidity” (A3, Oct. 23, 2012) that Metro’s recent attempt to censor racist advertisements was a violation of free speech. The ads, sponsored by the anti-Islamic American Freedom Defense Initiative read, “In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.”
“There is no doubt that the AFDI’s posters are offensive and ridiculous, but hatefulness and stupidity have never been cause for censorship in the United States,” Stern wrote. “It is only by protecting the speech of those whom we like least that we preserve the liberties we cherish most.”
He’s right, of course. But to leave the story at that — not to go beyond a wistful sigh that there’s nothing we can do to stop people like AFDI founder Pamela Geller from posting hateful messages in our public space — makes it seem like the victory must lie on the side of hate speech. On the contrary, many individuals and religious groups, including members of the Georgetown community, have responded to these ads exactly in the manner that First Amendment watchdogs would want: by making their own voices heard in support of love and tolerance.
It started in New York when, after these ads were posted in the subway system, people responded with vandalism. Some ads were slapped with a sticker saying “RACIST,” while others were covered in black spray paint. Then, counter-ads started to run in D.C. and New York. United Methodist Women ran an ad saying, “Hate speech is not civilized. Support peace in word and deed.” The Council on American-Islamic Relations posted a quote from the Quran: “Show forgiveness, speak for justice and avoid the ignorant.” Sojourners, a Christian organization, posted an ad stating simply, “Love your Muslim neighbors.”
Closer to home, a group of Georgetown students have been going to Metro stations and distributing flyers supporting peace. Our very own Rachel Gartner, rabbi and director of Jewish chaplaincy at Georgetown, wrote a piece for The Washington Post denouncing the ad and calling on Jewish Americans to speak out against it as an obligation of their faith. “As a rabbi, I insist on the responsibility to speak out against hateful speech,” Gartner wrote, “particularly when it comes at least in part from one of our own. Judaism teaches [that] anyone who has the ability to intervene but does not is held responsible [by God] for those sins.”
Gartner makes an important point: the First Amendment guarantees not simply a right, but also a responsibility, to speak out and take responsibility for the consequences of our speech. These ads are meant to incite fear and hatred of Muslims, equating savagery with jihad and, by extension, with Muslims. This tactic is crude, offensive and irresponsible. Anti-Islamic propaganda has real consequences for the daily lives of Muslims and non-Muslims around the country and around the world.
U.S. media rarely provide a platform to share the experiences of the Muslims who are vilified in public discourse. When the other side of the story is never told — when all we see are depictions of Muslims as terrorists intent on jihad — it becomes easy to accept racist stereotypes about who is “civilized” and who is “savage.” These attitudes creep into policy decisions just as they spur horrific hate crimes. Speech has consequences.
Censorship is not the answer. More speech is better, especially in cases such as this. It is significant that the response to these ads has overwhelmingly been one promoting love. On a topic that too often incites a squabbling match rather than meaningful debate, Jews, Christians and Muslims have refused to take the AFDI’s bait. Instead, they are using it as an opportunity to come together against intolerance. Juxtaposed with the AFDI’s ad referring to human beings as savages, the ads calling for peace, love and justice expose the AFDI ad for what it really is: racist, cynical and hateful. They shame the AFDI for dishonoring its right to free speech so egregiously.

Georgetown professor and former Republican Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel has been nominated as President Barack Obama’s next Secretary of Defense.
Obama made the announcement Monday morning, along with his choice for John Brennan as the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
While Hagel has accepted the nomination, he must still be confirmed by the Senate.
The nomination has attracted a firestorm of accusations that Hagel, a Vietnam veteran with two purple hearts, is anti-Israel, antigay and complacent toward Iran, according to The Washington Post. The Post reported that Obama’s announcement prompted the formation of several support and opposition groups seeking to influence the senatorial vote, including one financed by the Emergency Committee for Israel.
The Hoya previously reported that in a Sept. 22, 2008, address in Riggs Library, Hagel urged America to engage and seek common interests with the Middle East, heralding the coming presidency as a pivotal moment in U.S.-Middle East relations.
“We can’t squander the next four years,” he is reported to have said. “The next president will have to make Congress, the Senate and the world a partner.”
Hagel, who, according to The New York Times supported the American war in Afghanistan but quickly withdrew initial support for the Iraq War, also said in the 2008 address at Georgetown that traditional methods of force are not appropriate for conflicts in the Middle East.
“The Middle East is a tribal land, it has a history, it is complicated,” he said. “Military strength is not the solution in the Middle East.”
Amid uncertainty about Hagel’s term as potential Secretary of Defense, Michael Bailey, chair of the government department, said he foresees continuity with current Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta’spolicy.
“I think it means four more years of the same approach: centrist — and sometimes conservative — foreign policy with more liberal people at least being in the room,” Bailey wrote in an email.
Hagel was due to teach an international affairs course, titled “21st Century Geopolitical Realities,” next semester, but the class has been cancelled in the wake of his nomination, according to enrolled student Taylor Wettach (SFS ’13).
Wettach, who expressed disappointment at the course’s cancellation, said he signed up because he wanted to learn from someone who had been at the forefront of important foreign policy decisions in recent years.
“For me, perception was that Chuck Hagel was a good cross in terms of being on the policy side and making the big decisions in the political arena,” Wettach said. “He would have been great to learn from.”
Wettach, who added that Hagel solicited biographies from the class to gauge student interests, said that communication about the status of the course could have been clearer but he understood the decision to cancel it.
“It would have been nice to have a little more information and more knowledge, but given the situation, [the university] did the best [it] could,” he said. “If I had been asked to be Secretary of Defense, I would have cancelled my class, too.”
Carol Lancaster, Dean of the Walsh School of Foreign Service, said she regretted Hagel’s departure from Georgetown’s faculty but wished him well in office as Secretary of Defense if confirmed.
“He is a man of integrity, experienced in defense and security issues, a true patriot and an impressive leader. I shall be sad to see him leave Georgetown — he has been a successful, engaging professor and a very good citizen, participating in many extracurricular activities at Georgetown during his time with us,” she wrote in an email. “I look forward to his service as a successful Secretary of Defense.”
In addition to his undergraduate geopolitics course, Hagel previously taught a graduate course, titled “Redefining Geopolitical Relationships,” in which he was known for creative teaching methods.
A Nov. 19, 2010, article in The Hoya reported that Hagel rewarded the three students who most accurately predicted the outcomes of the election of that month with bottles of Federalist Zinfandel Wine. In addition, remembering students’ request that he arrange a class visit from President Obama, he treated the class to a surprise appearance by his former staffer T. J. Birkel donning an Obama mask.
“At a time when the world is so tense, so much trouble, I think it’s kind of fun to lighten it up a bit and remind us all we are humans,” Hagel said at the time.

In sharp contrast to the speedy and near-unanimous Jan. 29 confirmation of Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) for secretary of state, Georgetown professor and former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) faced a contentious first day of questioning Thursday at his hearing for secretary of defense.
Hagel testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which consists of 14 Democrats and 12 Republicans. Although Hagel is a Republican, some of his most vocal critics since Obama nominated him Jan. 7 have been fellow party members. Some Democrats on the committee also voiced concern with Hagel’s nomination at the hearing.
The first criticisms of Hagel came in the opening statements from committee chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and ranking member Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.).
While Levin noted Hagel’s service in the Vietnam War, he also criticized the former senator’s willingness to engage in talks with Iran as well his stance on U.S. relations with Israel.
Inhofe expressed dissent towards the nomination, saying that he and Hagel are “too philosophically opposed.”
“Sen. Hagel’s record is deeply troubling and out of the mainstream,” Inhofe said.
Hagel had support, however, from former Chairmen of the Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and John Warner (R-Va.), who introduced him prior to his own remarks.
“War for Chuck Hagel is not an abstraction,” Nunn said. “I’m confident that if he is confirmed, he will ask the tough questions.”
If confirmed, Hagel would be the first enlisted person and first Vietnam War veteran to be secretary of defense.
In his opening statement, Hagel said that as secretary of defense he would focus on counterterrorism and training Afghan forces in addition to enforcing his policy of prevention —as opposed to containment — of Iranian nuclear capability.
He also stressed his commitment to the men and women in the armed forces.
“Their safety success and welfare will always be at the forefront of the decisions I make,” he said.
Once the committee began its questioning, the hearing atmosphere became more heated.
Several senators grilled Hagel on Israel, but he emphasized that his record shows a clear support of the country and said that he had never voted against Israel in his 12 years in the Senate.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) countered Hagel’s statements by bringing up a letter that expressed support for Israel.
“The lack of signature [on that letter] by you sends chills up my spine,” Graham said.
Another recurring theme was Iran. Hagel came under fire following his nomination for his beliefs that the United States should engage with Iran, which has been called a state sponsor of terrorism.
“Engagement is not appeasement. Engagement is not surrender,” Hagel said at his hearing.
.Nuclear disarmament, particularly Hagel’s involvement with Global Zero — an  organization pushing for the elimination of nuclear weapons — and a report co-authored by him in 2012 was called into question by several senators.
“I’m uneasy about that vision expressed in your committee report,” Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) said.
However, Hagel’s most difficult moment may have been Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) questioning regarding the military surge in Iraq, which sent over 20,000 troops abroad in 2007.
“I’m not going to give you a yes or no answer,” Hagel said on whether the surge was correct or incorrect. “I’ll defer that judgment to history.”
“I think history has already made a judgment on the surge and I think you’re on the wrong side of it,” McCain said.
Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) was one of the few senators today who openly expressed support for Hagel and said that he would vote for the nominee.
If Hagel’s confirmation is approved by the committee, it will be brought to a full vote in the Senate, where politicians from both parties have pledged support. The Wall Street Journal predicts that Hagel’s confirmation may take several weeks. Proceedings will continue next Thursday.

Georgetown professor and former Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) has likely secured enough Senate votes to be confirmed as the next secretary of defense after Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) announced his support of the nominee.
Shelby’s vote will be the last of the 60 needed to end the Republican filibuster of Hagel’s nomination that began last week.
The GOP has criticized Hagel for what it perceives as his weak support of Israel, his conciliatory stance on Iran and his opposition to the Iraq War.
Among the senators supporting Hagel are all 55 Democrats and five Republicans. In addition to Shelby, the Republicans who have announced their support of Hagel are Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), MikeJohanns (R-Neb.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Ark.).
With no filibuster, the Senate can move forward on Hagel’s confirmation vote, which could take place as soon as Wednesday. Confirmation requires a simple majority.
If confirmed, Hagel will succeed current Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

The Program for Jewish Civilization’s three-day “Secularism on the Edge” conference addressed misconceptions about secularism Wednesday through Friday.
The conference included public interviews, panels and presentations covering topics ranging from women and secularism to Israeli religious secularism.
PJC Director Jacques Berlinerblau said that a common misconception, especially among Catholics, is that all secularists are atheists.
“Catholics haven’t always hated secularism. When they see that it can protect them, they embrace it,” Berlinerblau said. “As a premier research university, Georgetown has welcomed this discussion and research.”
Secularism is more of a political philosophy than a religious one, according to Berlinerblau. The opening event Wednesday was a public interview with Berlinerblau, in which he and Messiah College associate professor of history John Fea debated whether America is a secular or Christian nation.
Fea discussed the ways different interest groups — from the Christian right to secularists to the Christian left — have used historic documents to justify their views that America was founded as either a Christian or secular nation.
Fea said that the Declaration of Independence is dated “In the Year of Our Lord,” a fact that has been used to argue America’s founding as a Christian nation. However, Fea said that the line was simply added to the document by a clerk after the committee was dismissed.
However, Fea said that the first article of the 1796 Treaty of Tripoli stated that “the United States is not, in any sense, founded as a Christian nation.”
Secularists have often used this line as evidence against a religious origin for America, but Fea said it is necessary to be wary of the treaty because, at the time, Americans were attempting to stand on neutral grounds with Muslim Tripolitania.
“If you’re going to make an argument that America is not a Christian nation, I think you need to be cautious when using the Treaty of Tripoli, because it’s so easy to take this thing out of context,” Fea said.
People who believe America was founded as a Christian nation have unfavorable opinions of secularism, according to Fea.
“They think of aggressive atheists who have a particular agenda to try to remove anything related to religion from public life,” Fea said.
Fea also said he appreciated how this conference is working to redefine secularism. Fea is an evangelical Christian, but said he is also secular.
“My faith as an evangelical requires me to try to win you to Christ,” Fea said. “My desire would be to evangelize you and have you become a believer. Now, I don’t believe the state should be doing that. But I think in conversations over coffee, I want to talk about my faith.”
Laura Kurek (SFS ’16) valued the talk’s objective approach.
“I thought it was a very educated discussion,” Laura Kurek (SFS ’16) said. “I liked how it was historical. Fea did a good job at not letting his personal views detract from the topic at hand.”
Ann Yang (SFS ’15) agreed with Kurek.
“As a liberal, minority Christian, I am often uncomfortable with the Christian right,” she said. “This discussion was enlightening. It was refreshing to see that there’s a body of scholars who holds my views.”
Fea concluded by saying he was hopeful for a secular American future.
“I’m happy working with people of all faiths or no faiths at all to promote the common good,” he said. “We don’t need to have a Christian nation in order to live faithfully in the world.”
The BMW Center for German and European Studies, the Department of French and the Department of Government co-sponsored the event, along with the PJC.

When Joshua Siegel (GRD ’00) and Andrew Romans (GRD ’01) first met as students of Georgetown’s Masters in Business Administration program, they realized that, unlike those at many peer universities, Georgetown alumni were not investing in startup companies.
Last summer, Siegel and Romans began discussing plans to fill that void and officially launched Georgetown Alumni Angels Oct. 1, which will give alumni a chance to pool resources to invest in promising startups.
“We felt that because Georgetown is such a large and well-known community, it really needed its own group,” Siegel said. “It wasn’t something that the school could put together on a rapid basis. We decided that we could put it together quickly, effectively [and] efficiently.”
“The Georgetown alumni community is quite powerful and amazing, and so we want to harness that,” Romans added.
According to Romans, angel investing — when an individual or group of investors provide financial support for small startups and entrepreneurs — has grown in importance since the recent financial crisis, which caused venture capital firms to decrease investments in startups worldwide.
The investment group will pay particular attention to those startups that have a connection with the university, although its resources will not be limited to Georgetown companies.
“If someone goes to Georgetown and has a great company and we like it, then we want to fund it,” Romans said. “These guys should be able to get funding.”
Siegel said the start-ups with a Georgetown link would receive particular consideration. “For Georgetown deals … we will go the extra mile,” Siegel said. “We will always speak to the entrepreneur … so that we can look at their deal and try to refine it.”
According to Romans and Siegel, the group has already received proposals from alumni entrepreneurs in Germany, Turkey, Spain and Israel.
“We will evaluate each and every deal that comes to us, but we reject 99 percent of people that come to us on the entrepreneurial side,” Siegel said.
After examining such factors as a company’s financials and management team, Siegel and Romans will decide whether a company warrants funding. The few companies selected will be able to make a brief presentation to GAA investors — who are all either Georgetown alumni or affiliated with the university — and then network directly with the investors.
“It’s a little bit like speed dating,” Romans said. “When you meet somebody, you can decide within the first 30 seconds if you think that she or he is totally crazy and there’s no way you’d ever invest in that company.”
Siegel said GAA receives about five proposals a day, 90 percent of which he estimated have some relation to Georgetown.
GAA plans to hold networking events several times a year, the first of which is set for early March in New York City. Siegel said seven companies have been chosen to present at the event, six of which have a Georgetown connection. Though GAA cannot yet disclose their identity, the group includes startups involved in mobile payments, entertainment and mobile advertising.
GAA plans to invest between $250,000 and $750,000 in the selected startups. The group will support the selected companies for about two years, at which time it will refer the entrepreneurs to venture capital firms.
“In order for a startup to be successful, it needs more than just cash. It needs connections, and it needs guidance,” Romans said. “Part of what we’re doing is harnessing the Georgetown alumni community to make these companies successful.”
According to Siegel, one of the top priorities for the GAA is acquiring more professors and industry experts to serve as mentors for the entrepreneurs.
“Part of what should be appealing about going to Georgetown is that [students] know that there’s this powerful group of alumni that are organized and are able to review a deal, invest in the best ones and make them successful,” Romans said.

While the International Relations Club sends students to debate international relations at conferences several times a year, Friday the club held a conference of its own: the fourth annual Georgetown Diplomacy and International Security Conference.
The conference, titled “Looking Ahead: Future National Security Challenges,” featured former national security advisor General James Jones and former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General James Cartwright, who discussed international issues after 2014.
Five panels met throughout the day to talk about topics ranging from the changing American military to the role of the United Nations in peacekeeping to nuclear weapons to tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran and U.S.-Israel cooperation.
IRC members began preparations last semester, choosing a conference theme and selecting keynote speakers appropriate for this year’s theme of national security.
“We have to pick something that is current, that is timely,” GDISC Panel Coordinator Christian Chung (SFS ’15) said.
Panel coordinators are given freedom to construct specific panel topics within the overarching theme of the conference.
“It takes a lot of persistence,” GDISC Panel Coordinator Nathaniel Oppenheimer (SFS ’14) said. “We come up with these ideas and we have our dream panelists, and nine times out of 10 you are not going to get your panelist.”
Panelists include well-known professors and government officials who are experts on the specific topics.
“It’s really cool to see something from a broad subject or a broad theme to an idea that you have and then you have four renowned experts and a moderator come together to talk about it,” Chung said.
GDISC is the largest student-run conference of its kind. This year the IRC received over $4,000 for the event from such bodies as the Student Activities Commission, Georgetown University Student Association and Georgetown International Relations Association, a 501(c)(3) organization that collaborates with the IRC.
The conference attracts attendees from Georgetown and from around Washington, D.C.
More than 300 people are registered to attend the five panels, one more panel than the group included last year.
“We had to split it up into subcategories again because so many events are selling out right now,” Director of Research Reno Varghese (SFS ’16) said.
GDISC scheduled the conference for the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program weekend for early action students Friday and Saturday to attract prospective students.
“This would be a great event for GAAP students to find out what events can be held at Georgetown that are open to them, like seeing these huge names speak about topics they are obviously interested in,” Varghese said.
Over the past four years, GDISC has begun to build a reputation on campus.
“People are starting to remember us a little more,” GDISC Director of Logistics Audrey Atencio (SFS ’14), , said.
Despite GDISC’s relative obscurity, members are confident in this year’s conference.
“We always have a very nice finished product, and I think we have been able to produce that every year,” Oppenheimer said.
A previous version of this article incorrectly reported that the Student Activities Commission, Georgetown University Student Association and Georgetown International Relations Association were the only groups to provide funding for the conference. Additional sources of funding included The BMW Center for German and East European Studies, the Center for Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies, the Karl F. Landegger Program in International Business Diplomacy and the Mortara Center for International Studies. It further incorrectly stated that GIRA is a direct affliliate of the IRC.

To increase dialogue about the Arab-Israeli conflict, a group of Georgetown students revived J Street U, a pro-Israel, pro-peace advocacy group, this semester.
Although a chapter of J Street U was established at Georgetown in the fall of 2011, the group became inactive this fall after many of its members graduated. Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13) said that he hopes to re-establish the organization’s presence on campus before graduating in May.
According to Stirrett, J Street seeks to expand nationwide conversation about what it means to be pro-Israel in the United States and supports the two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16), who grew up surrounded by heavily pro-Israel relatives and felt conflicted upon learning about the actions of the Israeli government, said that the unique message of J Street U appealed to her.
“J Street says that you can be pro-Israel in that it has the right to exist without being pro-Israel in the sense that you agree with what its government is doing,” Wartenberg said.
When current President Jake Sorrells (COL ’16) approached Wartenberg earlier this year about the idea of reviving J Street U at Georgetown, she was instantly interested in the organization.
“As he was telling me more about what J Street does, I became very excited because I didn’t realize that there was an organization out there like this, that I wasn’t an outlier and [that] other people felt the same way,” Wartenberg said.
Although members of J Street U have reached out to other campus organizations, including Students for Justice in Palestine and the Georgetown Israel Alliance, they say the organization’s message is distinct.
“I feel like you have two polar sides, with Georgetown Israel Alliance and Students for Justice in Palestine,” Wartenberg said. “I don’t think there’s much dialogue and common ground. I see J Street as a good, moderate place for discussion about the conflict without disrespecting other people’s views.”
Sorrells agreed that his organization has a narrower focus than GIA.
Stirrett said that although J Street U’s work is consistent with GIA’s, J Street’s distinct status as a separate group allows it to focus on a two-state solution.
“We definitely have a very positive working relationship with GIA. GIA is a great organization, and we very much think that we have complementary goals,” Stirrett said. “They do some political advocacy in terms of pro-Israel, but J Street U has a more specific focus on ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a two-state solution, which is probably something GIA advocates for as well, but it’s not [its] main burning issue.”
“Both J Street and GIA are very much about supporting and celebrating Israel,” Sorrells added.
However, GIA Co-Vice President Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16), an Israeli-American who served in the Israel Defense Forces, disagreed with the strategies J Street uses to achieve its goals.
“The main idea of J Street is that it just has its own specific premise on social issues within Israel and social justice within Israeli society, solving all of the inequalities and problems that exist right now in Israel, and [it wants] to do that through lobbying and pressure from U.S. government officials,” Gabaisaid. “While I definitely want those changes that J Street is talking about to happen, I just believe that they should come from within the country, from within our own sovereign government.”
Despite the groups’ differences, Stirrett said that J Street U has a solid foundation to build on.
“I think it’s encouraging now that we have about two years of programming history,” he said. “I think we’ve been able to prove that this is not just a one-semester organization but something that can last longer.”
J Street U has held one general interest meeting so far that drew approximately 20 attendees. The group’s leaders hope to focus on building personal connections with other members of the organization.
“The first time around, we didn’t really focus too much on establishing a real community and building relationships with individuals … to really foment that group so we have a launching pad in the fall,”Sorrells said.
Georgetown J Street U also played host to the national organization’s regional workshop for the southeastern United States in February and sent several students to the J Street U national student conference in Washington, D.C., earlier this year.
Stirrett is confident that the future of J Street U is bright.
“I think that J Street U will continue to grow in size,” he said. “It provides a really important and valuable voice in the Georgetown community.”

Former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and Afghanistan Ryan Crocker and Chair of the International Relations at Boston University Andrew Bacevich weighed the pros and cons of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and cautioned against going to war too quickly at an event in Lohrfink Auditorium on Tuesday.
The event was held at the invitation of School of Foreign Service Dean Carol Lancaster and the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Vice President for New Initiatives Aaron David Miller and was the first discussion in a series to be co-sponsored with the Woodrow Wilson Center that will address key foreign policy challenges facing the United States.
Robin Wright, a Wilson Center distinguished scholar at the United States Institute of Peace, moderated the event, which explored how to bring clarity and honesty to discussion of war and intervention.
Wright began by citing Crocker’s and Bacevich’s personal experiences with service in Iraq and by asking them if the war in Iraq was justified.
Crocker, who is also dean of the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University, said that the future trajectory of Iraq is unclear.
“I am not sure that we have placed enough emphasis on the strategic framework agreement that might help Iraq deal with its problems,” Crocker said. “There are no short answers. These are complex questions. Is everything ever worth that number of casualties? It’s a hard thing to answer.”
Bacevich, who wrote “Breach of Trust: How Americans Failed Their Soldiers and Their Country,” firmly believes that the Iraq war was not worth it.
“We should judge a war by the purpose by which the war was undertaken and whether that purpose is fulfilled,” Bacevich said. “Are we making the region more stable? Are we making the region more democratic? Are we persuading the people who live in that part of the world to hold the United States in warm regard? I think the answer to those questions is obvious: No.”
Bacevich and Crocker also discussed what should be done in Syria. Wright asked them what they would say in a memo to the President.
Crocker said that the United States must proceed with caution. He emphasized containment over intervention, a point with which Bacevich agreed.
“We do not know the ground rules in Syria. It is an enormous human tragedy that we cannot fix militarily, and we would be fools to try.” Crocker said. “When it comes to national interest of the United States, Mr. President, I think you’d rather be considered heartless than mindless.”
The rest of the discussion focused on other complex issues in the region, such as problems in Iran and Israel. Bacevich and Crocker focused on the necessity of careful consideration before policy formation, understanding of adversarial forces and what constitutes American credibility in foreign affairs.
“Wars are evil,” Bacevich noted. “There can, however, be necessary wars.”
As a Syrian citizen, Sebastian Nicholls (SFS ’16) found the discussion of issues in the Middle East relevant and necessary and welcomed the event’s nonpartisan nature.
“[It] provided a very thoughtful discussion of wars, presenting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as they are, without the glory that politicians attribute and with a clarity that is rarely, if ever, seen in the media,” Nicholls said. “It was a frank discussion, and the conversation allowed essential points to become clear.”

Georgetown was among more than 1000 nonprofit organizations that suffered significant asset losses due to unauthorized uses of funds, according to a Washington Post investigation published last week.
The Post’s report, which looked at tax forms from 2008 to 2012, has now prompted multiple federal investigations into whether these nonprofit organizations properly reported diversions, which are unauthorized uses of funds such as theft or embezzlement, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Post specifically examined if nonprofits checked “yes” or “no” to having a significant diversion of assets on their tax forms. A diversion is considered significant if it exceeds $250,000 or 5 percent of the organization’s receipts or assets.
According to Georgetown’s 2011 federal financial disclosure form 990 for tax-exempt organizations, obtained by The Washington Post, an unspecified university administrator improperly “compensated herself approximately $390,000” from 2007 to 2010 for work relating to a university-sponsored conference. The compensation was done through an unknown bank account over which the administrator had signature authority.
The documents state that Georgetown immediately closed the bank account upon learning of its existence and transferred the balance to a university controlled and audited account. The university then entered into an agreement with the administrator, who repaid all the unapproved compensation, plus interest.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh said she could not disclose details due to confidential personnel issues.
“This investigation uncovered the additional compensation received by the administrator for work relating to the conference, so we followed internal procedures for disciplining the parties involved,” Pugh said.
Pugh would not disclose what those internal procedures were or if the administrator is still employed by the university. She said that Georgetown would expect to be contacted about a federal investigation, adding that the university has followed all proper procedures.
“The university investigated the situation and reported it through its normal governance procedures and made the appropriate disclosures on its IRS form 990,” Pugh said.
This most recent incident follows two previous cases of fraud at Georgetown.
Federal prosecutors accused Pedro Paulo dos Santos, who held various positions at Georgetown from 1998 to 2005, of falsifying documents, diverting funds and inventing a fictitious company in order to obtain more than 100 fraudulent checks totaling about $311,000 from October 2001 to January 2005. Santos served as associate director and program coordinator of the university’s Brazilian Studies Program from 2002 until his termination.
According to court records, dos Santos admitted to the theft when confronted by university auditors but fled to Brazil the following day, where he remains at large.
Additionally, former Georgetown University Medical Center administrator Adriana Santamaria was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison for stealing more than $350,000 from Georgetown from 1995 to 2002. Because Santamaria had stolen federal grant funds, which include overhead costs not associated with any individual program, Georgetown was forced to repay over $500,000 to the federal government.
Although university officials stated then that they had implemented new safeguards to prevent this type of theft after they discovered Santamaria’s embezzlement in 2003, court documents show that dos Santos used similar methods to funnel money out of university accounts for almost two years.
“In light of the dos Santos case, over the past two years, Georgetown has also taken steps to increase oversight procedures, in particular by establishing new policies requiring review and reconciliation by financial managers,” university spokeswoman Julie Bataille told The Hoya in 2007. “On the main campus specifically, there has been an increased enforcement of existing policies and procedures [and] the development of additional controls and procedures.”
In the most recent case, however. the administrator’s theft went unnoticed for approximately three years.
“Certainly any large institution faces an ongoing challenge to ensure that all of its activities are conducted in a manner consistent with policies and procedures, and we are making every effort we can to improve our system, and training and awareness,” Pugh said. “It’s an ongoing challenge at a large institution.”
The unapproved compensation accounted for less than 0.04 percent of Georgetown’s annual operating revenue, according to Pugh.
“This is distinguishable from those two [previous] cases of fraud or embezzlement because there’s no evidence that the employee had intent to defraud anyone. The individual did not submit any false documentation and fully cooperated with the investigation and is voluntarily paying restitution,” Pugh said.
She emphasized the university’s efforts to prevent such situations in the future.
“Over a few years, we have adopted more rigorous policies and internal controls,” she said, citing a more robust compliance program and an internal audit function. “We’ve really made some efforts to make the policies clearer and to make sure all employees are educated about them and their responsibilities under the policies.”
The Post also reported that Columbia University was defrauded about $5 million during a two-month period in 2010, when its medical center accounts-payable system was reprogrammed to the bank account of computer-specialist George Castro, who was not a university employee. Columbia notified the authorities, cooperated with the criminal investigation and recovered almost all the money.
In the Post’s investigation, the largest case of financial diversion occurred at Yeshiva University, a private university in New York, which lost $106 million in a Ponzi scheme linked to Bernie Madoff.

Students for Justice in Palestine withdrew its co-sponsorship of a film screening with the Georgetown Israel Alliance and J Street U, an event that was supposed to herald an unprecedented collaboration between the historically contentious organizations.
The SJP board made the last-minute decision Tuesday to officially disassociate the organization from the event, after determining that it did not align with their national organization’s platform, which opposes normalization — treating Israelis and Palestinians as equals instead of the oppressor and oppressed, respectively — of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
After SJP’s withdrawal, GIA and J Street U, which advocates for a two-state solution, also withdrew their co-sponsorships, instead attending as individuals rather than representatives of their respective organizations. The screening of “The Other Son,” a French film about an Israeli and a Palestinian switched at birth, still attracted more than 100 people.
“I guess from the beginning of the time that the event was conceived I knew myself and a few others always felt a little bit uncomfortable with the event, but we continued,” SJP President Albert Doumar (SFS ’15) said. “As we began to have more reservations about it, we had to decide among ourselves how to frame the event to be suitable to our cause or an event. … There was no way to structure the event to do that.”
Doumar maintains that the Georgetown SJP chapter did not receive explicit pressure from outside groups to withdraw. While SJP leaders were apologetic for the late hour of withdrawal, they reached the conclusion that participating in an event contradictory to their ideals would have been detrimental.
“Discussions were taking place on campus between our members and we were receiving word from different groups,” he said. “It wasn’t so much backlash as [the groups] trying to explain more about normalization and trying to understand from us why we were undertaking the event.”
As publicity for the event spread, the Georgetown chapter of SJP received messages from chapters at Rutgers, Cornell and the University of Maryland College Park, among others.
“There’s a recognition that all of us are allies in the same struggle, so it was important we presented a unified front to make sure the decisions of any one SJP did not jeopardize the goals of the greater organization,” Doumar said.
Though GIA and J Street U understood SJP’s obligation to its national organization, student leaders were disappointed.
“With their withdrawal, it was a very unfavorable action because it undermined the very purpose of the event,” GIA President Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16) said. “To facilitate discussion not only on campus but beyond, we needed to use organizations that were bigger than campus.”
In October, GIA held an event with both Israeli and Palestinian guests that was designed to inspire campus discussion. Gabai hoped for the screening to be an event that would have extended the possibility of discussion beyond campus and felt that opportunity was lost when the organizations withdrew their sponsorship in favor of individual leadership.
“The minute we changed it to an individual-based event, the agenda was marginalized to an on-campus conversation,” he said. “All in all, we still have to look at the glass half-full and go on with the event.”
J Street U organizers felt that the universal decision to attend as individuals was the best way to promote dialogue, despite the sudden developments.
“In some ways it would have been a stronger collective message to show this organizational partnership to other campuses across the nation, but at the same time, we were stripped of that luxury by the sticky situation the leaders of SJP were put in,” J Street U President Jake Sorrells (SFS ’16) said. “I think that was outside our control, and we responded in a way that would allow us to capitalize on that opportunity. There was really nothing else we can do. It inadvertently strengthened our message.”
However, Sorrells maintained that SJP’s withdrawal represented the reasons why dialogue was necessary.
“I think the situation that unravelled emboldened our resolve to conduct this program,” Sorrells said. “It was sort of a microcosm of the very challenges that have typically hindered [progress].”
Gabai said he had hoped that SJP members would have broken out of the constraints of the larger national organization.
“Georgetown students are trendsetters,” Gabai said. “I was very saddened, because I thought that the board of the SJP would be able to set the trend.”
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner delivered remarks after the screening, in addition to a videotaped message from Director of Muslim Chaplaincy Imam Yahya Hendi, both university officials.
“What happened at GU does not happen elsewhere. It did happen and let’s build on that,” Hendi wrote in an email. “I am so proud of our kids, all of them, for they made it happen. [It’s] going beyond borders to build bridges.”
Gartner encouraged participating students and said that she was proud of the way the organizers handled the event.
“It would break my heart if this minor snafu derailed the process that began when they were planning this,” she said. “My prayer is that students build on the relationships they’ve made in preparing for this event, and build on what they’ve learned about themselves and one another, both in the planning stages and at the film showing itself and find a way to move forward.”
J Street U Treasurer Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16), who conceived the idea of the event, said that despite the last-minute challenges, he is hopeful for future cooperation.
“I really want to stress that we view this event as absolutely not a failure,” Jatovsky said. “We will look back on this as an evening that kickstarted the development of dialogue.”
 
Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated Imam Yahya Hendi’s title as director of Jewish chaplaincy. He is director of Muslim chaplaincy.

	A week and a half after Students for Justice in Palestine withdrew from a film screening meant to foster dialogue with pro-Israel student groups, the Jewish and Muslim Chaplaincies held Amplified Voices, a concert aiming to increase dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis through music, in Gaston Hall on Sunday.	Presented as a joint effort by the Jewish Chaplaincy, the Muslim Chaplaincy and the department of government’s master’s program in conflict resolution, the concert attracted Jewish and Arab residents, with approximately 500 attendees.	Not all students involved in last week’s screening through SJP, the Georgetown Israel Alliance or J Street U, a group that advocates for a two-state solution, were involved in the planning of this concert, despite the two events’ similar goals.	J Street U Treasurer Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16), however, did marketing for the concert and was also responsible for planning last Wednesday’s screening of “The Other Son,” a French film about a Palestinian and Israeli switched at birth, which saw the withdrawal of official sponsorship from J Street U and the Georgetown Israel Alliance in solidarity with SJP. The screening continued without official sponsorship from any Israeli or Palestinian group.	“[The concert] really was a very important event in that it played to a lot of similar themes and goals … that we believe the movie event was ultimately successful in achieving in terms of kicking off this dialogue,” he said.	He also attributed success to the formats of both events, noting the eschewal of explicit politics, despite the fact that SJP withdrew because of reluctance to appear in opposition to their organization’s national stance, which sees Israelis as oppressors and Palestinians as the oppressed.	The SJP said that treating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict purely through a cultural lens contributed to the normalization of the issue to which they are opposed.	“This kind of an event stresses these two cultures that haven’t been getting along … can come together,” SJP President Albert Doumar (SFS ’15) said. “This is the kind of idea that SJP rejects because of what it implies about the occupation. When you have an event that’s just cultural or mutual understanding, you imply that those sides have long-running grievances against the other side and those need to be solved.”	Peacebuilding Connections, a group that uses art for cross-cultural initiatives, helped plan Sunday’s concert.	“This event is here to bring together people who believe that we need to act collectively in order to solve our problems, and that peace will only come when that is the first desire on both sides,” concert producer Bob Schlehuber said.	The concert’s first act, “Heartbeat,” usually consists of more than 25 artists funded by the Israeli-Palestinian Youth Music Project. Only five of these musicians performed at this particular concert, but they had the audience on its feet for much of the time and sang in English, Hebrew and Arabic.	“I’ve grown up with this barrier wall around my country, Israel. I’ve always been afraid of the people on the other side that would hurt us if there was no wall,” Heartbeat guitarist Guy Gefen said to the audience. “But now I know that our two peoples can truly be brothers, if we wish to.”	Recording artist David Broza played part of his new album via Skype with vocalist Muhammad Mughrabi, a Palestinian rapper and East Jerusalem resident.	Broza, an Israeli, recorded his entire album in the Palestinian sector of the city and collaborated with Palestinian artists on the project, which stresses the need for peace and understanding. Haitian rapper Wyclef Jean will also appear on the album.	Andy Shallal, an Iraqi-American peace advocate who announced his candidacy for mayor of D.C. on Nov. 8, served as the event’s emcee.	“There has to be a place for peaceful dialogue in music and in politics,” Shallal said. “And that place should be front and center, because it is what the silent majority of Palestinians and Israelis really want – peace.”	Jordanian vocalist Faraj Siraj took the stage after Shallal’s speech, singing traditional Arab folk songs in Arabic, English and Spanish.	Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner spoke briefly following Siraj’s performance and cited the Muslim holy text.	“The Quran says that God made [Jews and Muslims] different not so that we will hate one another, but so that we may come to know and see each other in brotherhood,” Gartner said.	Soon after, folksinger and political peace activist Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary took the stage with his guitar to perform with his daughter Bethany, who sang with cellist Rufus Cappadocia.	Students saw these performances as a sign of the concert’s success in promoting its message.	“I think the fact that it interested these famous musicians is all the more testament for the recognition of the need to improve dialogue around campus and the creation of peaceful resolution between these two groups,” Jatovsky said.	After the concert, attendees browsed booths in Healy Hall with information about the performers and other groups involved in advocating for peace through music, including the YMCA Jerusalem Youth Chorus and the Voices of Peace Choir.	“Many people have become cynical as a result of how long the peace process is taking. But hope is free, anyone can have it, and if both sides work together to accept each other and move toward peace, then we can really accomplish something,” Schlehuber said.

	Egyptian Ramy Jan was scheduled to appear at a Dec. 5 event at Georgetown University until it was discovered he was the leader of the fledgling Egyptian Nazi Party and was promptly disinvited.
	The event, “Egypt and the Struggle for Democracy,” was to be hosted by Georgetown’s Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding and has since been postponed until late January.
	Jan is a founding member of Egypt’s Nazi Party, a small and insignificant group in Egyptian politics, The New York Times reported. However, the views he espouses are extreme. He appeared on Dream1 TV in Egypt in September 2011 and stated in remarks translated by The Middle East Media Research Institute that he does not recognize the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel and that the Egyptian Nazi party has aims to build a nuclear reactor.
	 “Our political goal is to make the Arab race, or Arabic speakers, the best race,” Head of the Egyptian Nazi Party Muhi Al-Din Gamal said in the video. This opinion stands in direct conflict with the ACMCU’s mission, posted on its website, which is “to improve relations between the Muslim world and the West.”
	Georgetown originally invited Jan as a representative of Christians Against the Coup, which did not support the military ouster of then-president Hosni Mubarak.
	Founding director of the center, professor John Esposito, declined The Hoya’s request for comment. However, in an article on The New York Times‘ website, he said that the organizers had not known about Jan’s views.
	“This was new to us that he had a background like that and as soon as it came to our attention he was immediately disinvited,” Esposito said. “We had no idea that there was this issue out there.”
 ACMCU Associate Director Kristine Kidwell also said that the center did not know about Jan’s position in the Egyptian Nazi Party.
 “Ramy Jan is absolutely not coming to speak at Georgetown University at any point,” she wrote in an email. “No one involved in the creation of this event had any idea whatsoever about Jan’s questionable affiliations. He is no longer invited to speak at Georgetown, and we are amending our conference speakers and schedule.”
	The event’s original page on ACMCU’s website has been taken down, and the new page features a bold announcement at the top.
	“Due to lengthy delays with our Egyptian participants getting visas, the Dec. 5 Conference has been postponed to Jan 30, 2014, to enable their participation,” the notice on the new page read and has since been taken down altogether.
	The conference will feature Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), the first Muslim member elected to Congress, who will give the keynote address, and Dr. Wael Haddara, former adviser to deposed Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi.
	Other speakers include professors from American University in Cairo, The George Washington University and the University of Toronto, as well as various scholars and journalists.

Eight Georgetown students received the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship for their spring 2014 semesters abroad last month.
Established by the International Academic Opportunity Act of 2000, the Gilman Scholarship offers awards for American undergraduates who are traditionally underrepresented in U.S. study abroad programs, including students with high financial need and non-traditional students.
The Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the U.S. Department of State sponsors the scholarship, which emphasizes fostering relationships between the United States and the peoples of other countries.
The number of Georgetown scholarship recipients marks a slight increase from the number of scholarship winners in recent years, which Georgetown Overseas Studies Advisor Tineka Lebrun attributes to the work of Lauren Tuckley, associate director of the Office of Fellowships, Awards and Research.
“The Gilman Scholarship’s goal of providing accessibility to study abroad matches well with our own goals as a university by providing additional funds that supplement a student’s financial aid package,” Lebrun said.
After returning to the United States, Gilman scholars are required to complete Follow-on Service Projects within their home institutions or communities, with the intent to promote international education and the scholarship. Examples of potential projects include presenting the country of study to young students or organizing a pen-pal program between classrooms at home and abroad. The service project proposal is a key part of the scholarship application and is heavily evaluated during the selection process.
Study abroad locations for the eight Georgetown recipients this year include South Africa, Portugal, Brazil, Japan, India, Italy and Jordan. In total, over 2,300 scholarships of up to $5,000 each will be awarded nationwide this academic year.

Daisy Franco (SFS ’15)
Destination: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Why did you apply for the scholarship?
Study abroad is very expensive and flights to Brazil even more so. The scholarship is a huge financial help. Also, there is a proposal needed for the scholarship, and that allows me to showcase what I did in Rio. My proposal involves my internship in a women’s rights [nongovernmental organization].
Why do you want to travel to Rio de Janeiro?
I am studying Portuguese and Latin American Studies, so it is the perfect place. It is also the opposite of D.C. and will force me out of my comfort zone.
How do you think this scholarship will help your future goals or ambitions?
It is making studying abroad possible, and now I have the opportunity to live what I am studying, which is very important. School is more about sitting in a classroom; you have to live what you learn.

Mary Byrne (NHS ’15)
Destination: Cape Town, South Africa
Why did you choose to travel to Cape Town?
I have been to Rwanda twice before, I went once this past spring break with other Georgetown students and two Georgetown professors to examine development in the country, and then I had an internship working at the Rwandan National Reference Laboratory in the summer. These experiences in Rwanda really sparked my interest in learning more about other parts of Africa, especially in terms of health development. I have a significant interest in women’s health. I hope to be an OB-GYN. South Africa has one of the world’s worst maternal mortality rates, and many campaigns and programs have been launched to combat this issue. I hope that while studying abroad in South Africa I could either set up an internship or do volunteer work with some of these organizations.
Is there anything specific you’re looking forward to next semester abroad?
Learning more about South African culture, volunteer experience, exploring a new place, everything!
How do you think this scholarship will help your future goals or ambitions?
Between graduating from Georgetown and going to med school, I hope to take a gap year to work in some sector of health and development, ideally in a location in Africa. Studying abroad in Cape Town will help me solidify this interest and also provide me with a greater likelihood of getting a job in Africa, as I will have significant experience and knowledge of African culture.

Alberto Gallegos (COL ’15)
Destination: Tokyo, Japan
Why do you want to travel there?
I want to travel in Japan because I’m very interested in the Japanese culture, and this semester I’m taking intensive Japanese and so integrating myself in Japan would help to develop my language skills. Sophia [University], in particular, because you didn’t have to take all the classes in Japanese; I’m a beginner so I’m still developing my Japanese, so I could take an intensive Japanese course there while still taking my other classes in English.
Is there anything specific you’re looking forward to next semester abroad?
Just getting a chance to travel. I’ve never been anywhere outside the United States except for a little state in Mexico in the upper north of Mexico, so I’ve never really traveled anywhere else so this is very exciting.
How do you think this scholarship will help your future goals or ambitions?
In the future, I plan to take part of the Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme, which is basically I go to Japan for two years to help high school students to learn English. I don’t really teach, but I help a teacher there while I’m there, like a student aide. That’s what I want to do in the future for about two years and being able to travel to Japan first to see if I really do want to do that would be great, and the scholarship gives me $3,000 that I can use to accomplish my goal.

Christina McGrath (COL ’15)
Destination: Florence, Italy
Why did you apply for the scholarship? 
There was an email that was sent out through GOFAR and [the Georgetown Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program] that was about the Gilman, encouraging people to look it up and apply. I did some research and found out that it was not a very huge application. I fit all the qualifications for it. The idea that interested me was that it was more than just saying, this is why I deserve money to go abroad. There’s a service component to it, which was appealing to me in a sense that it was a little different from the other grants that one might apply for.
Why do you want to travel there?
I am an Italian and art history double major. Florence, to me, is the epitome of everything that has ever appealed to me about Italian and art history. Florence is basically the cradle of the Renaissance, which might sound cliche but is my biggest interest. The Renaissance, the Baroque period, these all have a center in Florence. Between all the excellent Renaissance art that’s there, not to mention all literary traditions that arose out of Florence, you can think of Machiavelli, Boccaccio, Petrarch — all of these authors had very strong ties to Florence. To me, I feel that Italian culture, as we know it, definitely was formed in a great degree in Florence. And one tiny little fact: Italian, as it is spoken today, standard Italian that is not dialectal, grew out of the Florentine dialect; it was formed mainly by Dante, Boccaccio, various authors who wrote in the vernacular of Florence, which is now standardized Italian.
How do you think this scholarship will help your future goals or ambitions?
My hope for after graduating is to enter directly into a Ph.D. program in Italian. I hope to ultimately become an Italian professor. For me, I feel that this scholarship is enabling me to get more out of my time in Florence, and I feel that this time in Florence will be integral not only to my personal development, but to my professional development as I discover more about Italy and the aspects of Italian culture, language and art that interest me and will inform my career as a professor.

Juan Gonzalez (COL ’15)
Destination: Pune, India
Why do you want to travel there?
I am incredibly passionate about economics, as of this semester actually. India is booming economically. It’s facing a plethora of social issues, and I believe that it’s a good place to study development, economics and to witness the growth of a country first hand.
Is there anything specific you’re looking forward to next semester abroad?
From the people that I’ve talked to that have been to India, they have nothing but good and crazy things to say, so I’m looking forward to just immersing in this completely different world to ours — just a different culture, different system, different everything.
How do you think this scholarship will help your future goals or ambitions?
For the future, I want to be or eventually become a United States congressman, and I feel that by studying abroad and studying the economic issues faced by India, the United States can learn a lot from that, especially since they have three times the people. I just feel like there’s something to learn there about how to go about implementing economic equity.

Elyssa Skeirik (SFS ’15)
Destination: Amman, Jordan
What are you studying?
My course of study is I am a culture and politics major with a focus on identity politics, but my regional specialty is the Middle East, so I’m also taking Arabic.
What was your reaction upon learning that you earned this scholarship?
I was super excited because I have been saving money for this for basically my whole life to be able to travel there, but now because I can use the scholarship for my basic travel expenses like a plane ticket, I can use money that I was saving to do extra stuff. For example, I can travel more while I’m there.
How do you think that this scholarship will help further your future goals and aspirations?
It’s going to enable me to travel instead of just staying in Jordan — going to other places in the region, hopefully Israel, hopefully Cairo if it’s safe — and so having that experience will really help me with my future studies, to be able to see different places.

Keegan Terek (COL ’15)
Destination: Lisbon, Portugal
Why do you wish to travel there?
I’m required to study abroad for my Spanish and Portuguese Studies major, and I wanted to go somewhere where I wouldn’t be surrounded by English-speaking Georgetown students. So, I applied with Independent Status to the CIEE Program in Lisbon. I’m also interested in traveling to Lusophone Africa some day, and Portugal has a stronger connection to those countries than does Brazil.
How do you think that this scholarship will help further your future goals and ambitions?
The scholarship gives me the opportunity to study Portuguese intensively and exclusively, an experience I have never had. As I hope to use foreign languages in my future career, advanced proficiency in Portuguese will be undoubtedly beneficial to me.

Colleen Roberts (COL ’15)
Destination: Cape Town, South Africa
Why do you wish to travel there in particular?
I was really interested in going to a place I haven’t been before, going to a new continent and also going to a location that I didn’t think I might get up and go to on my own. I figured that later in life, if I wanted to go to Europe, I could like easily go, so I was really interested in going somewhere kind of distant, so I decided on the continent of Africa. South Africa in particular I chose because I was really interested in the history. I took a comparative history course on South Africa and the United States during my sophomore year, which really solidified my interest in going.
How do you think that this scholarship in particular is going to further your goals and aspirations?
I think that the scholarship’s really helpful because it means, for one, that I don’t have to take out an additional loan for study abroad to cover those extra costs, and the study abroad experience I expect to be something that’s really formative and really unique in my undergraduate career, so I’m really glad that it’s allowing me to further that opportunity.

Since School of Foreign Service adjunct professor Michael Scheuer appeared to endorse the assassinations of President Barack Obama and U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron in a column Dec. 23, he has been the subject of media attention and criticism. Yet in an interview with The Hoya, Scheuer did not back down from the comments that angered Americans across the political spectrum.
The crux of the media uproar focuses on the column’s close, which advises Obama and Cameron to pay heed to the writings of 17th century English republican Algernon Sidney, who called for the execution of tyrants and glorification of their assassins.
“There must therefore be a right of proceeding judicially or extra-judicially against all persons who transgress the laws; or else those laws, and the societies that should subsist by them, cannot stand; and the ends for which governments are constituted, together with the governments themselves, must be overthrown,” wrote Sidney, who was executed for treason against King Charles II and whose writings later served as inspiration for American revolutionaries.
The Sidney passage comes at the end of the column, which labels Obama and Cameron as “the Islamists’ only indispensable allies,” describes a growing religious war and criticizes the two politicians for their approaches.
In an interview with The Hoya, Scheuer said this criticism could be applied to any Western leader.
“Obama, Mrs. Clinton, Bush, Cheney, all of them tell the because [Islamists] hate how we live. They don’t. They don’t hate the American people, what they do is hate the American government for what it does in their world,” Scheuer said. “Until we realize that as fact, this war — we’re going to keep losing it as we are now.”
Scheuer said that if electoral options failed to remove egregiously erring leaders, the people of a republic have a right to pursue other options, including protests, refusing to pay taxes and as a last resort, revolution. Scheuer, in this vein, refused to shy away from endorsing assassination.
“At some point, when push comes to shove, you kill people and get them out of the way,” Scheuer said. “But it’s the end of a very long process, and one would hope that supposedly smart men who went to Harvard and Oxford would know that the future is not a happy one for them if they continue to disregard the liberties their people have fought for over centuries.”
Scheuer’s column, published on his website, non-intervention.com, focused on the partnership between the United States and the United Kingdom as well as the countries’ wartime policies. Scheuer, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was the former head of the agency’s Osama bin Laden unit, criticized the leaders for their policies regarding the Muslim world, including their support of Tahrir Square activists during the Arab Spring.
The column quickly received traction on news websites, most prominently on The Daily Beast, where columnist David Frum described Scheuer’s comments as “advocacy of murder,” in a column entitled“Michael Scheuer’s Meltdown.”
Scheuer has received criticism from liberal and conservative quarters alike.
“I’ve offended everyone. It comes from leftist websites because they think Obama really is the second coming of Christ, and it comes from the conservative websites because conservatives would love to have me on their team except I don’t want unnecessary wars and I can’t stand the American relationship with Israel,” Scheuer said. He emphasized that his desire to extricate the United States from its relationship with its Middle East ally is not synonymous with anti-Semitism.
Scheuer, who since 2005 has taught two graduate-level courses, “Al Qaeda” and “Al Qaeda and the Global Jihad” for the Security Studies Program during both summer and fall semesters, said he has never been approached by the university regarding his outside writings, which have been the subject of past controversy. Although his critics have written to the administration in protest, according to Scheuer, Center for Security Studies Director Bruce Hoffman has defended him before, calling him the leading scholar on Osama bin Laden. The Center for Security Studies declined to comment for this article through Associate Director David Maxwell, citing Scheuer’s status as a private citizen and lack of a spring 2014 course at Georgetown.
Scheuer did say he expected to hear from the university on this occasion, although he has not yet heard anything.
University spokeswoman Stacy Kerr said that the university was not in the practice of censoring opinion.
“This is the essence of academic freedom. Being committed to the free and open exchange of ideas does not mean that we approve of or endorse each and every statement made by members of our faculty,” Kerr wrote in an email. “The answer to speech that one finds disagreeable or controversial is not censorship but more speech and more dialogue. As such, we welcome everyone’s right to disagree and to express their opinions openly.”

In response to the American Studies Association’s decision to endorse an academic boycott of Israeli institutions, Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia issued a statement Dec. 23 rejecting the ban and vowing to maintain standards of open dialogue and academic freedom.
DeGioia’s press release emphasized a commitment to free expression and the exchange of ideas, which he believes are central to the university’s mission.
“The recent resolution of the American Studies Association endorsing a boycott of Israeli universities undermines the academic freedom that is essential to the mission of the Academy,” the statement read. “As an academic institution, it is Georgetown’s responsibility to deepen engagement and fosterdialogue between scholars and societies to enhance the entire global academic community.”
The original ASA petition cited Israeli human rights abuses in the Palestinian territories, among other violations of international law, as justification for the boycott.
“The resolution is in solidarity with scholars and students deprived of their academic freedom, and it aspires to enlarge that freedom for all, including Palestinians,” the ASA’s letter endorsing the ban stated.
The site reported that over 66 percent of ASA members supported the organization’s decision in a nationwide vote.
Even though Georgetown is not endorsing the boycott, certain members of Georgetown’s faculty are members of the ASA and have publicly expressed support for the decision. In a letter to the editor of the Washington Post published on Dec. 27, adjunct professor Noura Erakat of the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies argued that the boycott draws international attention to Israel’s treatment of Palestinian citizens.
“The boycott, divestment and sanctions movement … is a call from Palestinians to international solidarity,” Erakat wrote. “By heeding it, the ASA did not single out Israel; it listened to Palestinians who demand equality.”
In his press release, DeGioia noted that university faculty might have differing positions on the issue of Israeli-Palestinian relations and made a commitment to supporting ideological diversity among members of the staff.
“I recognize these are matters on which colleagues can disagree,” the statement said. “While the position of our University remains opposed to any boycott, we will certainly defend the rights of those who disagree.”
According to Provost Robert Groves, however, the university administration agreed that the boycott violated free expression and academic dialogue.
“There was absolute unity on the principles that motivated the action,” Groves said. “We are devoted to freedom of ideas and disclosure among opposing viewpoints. That is what universities are about and what Georgetown is about.”
Groves further noted that Georgetown could never endorse any limitation on the free exchange of ideas, which would violate its fundamental academic principles.
“Our basic belief is that the role of Georgetown in a larger context is hearing different viewpoints,” he said. “This statement is evidence of our devotion to the principle, and as an academic institution, we wouldn’t do anything to suppress dialogue.”
Student groups also voiced support for President DeGioia’s rejection of the academic boycott.
J Street U President Jake Sorrells (COL ’16) noted the valuable role academia can play in promoting intercultural understanding and the detrimental effects of restricting it.
“I think that the boycott actually exacerbates a lot of the tensions between the two sides,” Sorrells said. “It allows a lot of the animosity, racism and ignorance that is driving this conflict to fester because the more people aren’t interacting with each other through dialogue, the more misconceptions about the other are really able to thrive.”
Sorrells also noted that while some recent Israeli actions could be viewed as warranting some form of condemnation or criticism, academia is not the appropriate setting for a response to them.
“I agree with the frustration and aggravation that is behind the boycott and that in some ways it is well meaning,” Sorrells said. “But I don’t think it’s the right tactic to go about achieving meaningful change.”
Across the country, over 90 universities have rejected the ASA proposal, including Harvard, Columbia, Dartmouth and Princeton, as well as many other Catholic institutions like Trinity College, The Catholic University of America, The University of Notre Dame and Loyola University-Maryland. Catholic University of America President John Garvey issued a particularly strong condemnation of the boycott.

Israeli author and journalist Ari Shavit discussed his new book, “My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel,” on Tuesday in Copley Formal Lounge as part of the Georgetown University Program for Jewish Civilization’s spring lecture series.
Shavit is a senior correspondent and member of the editorial board at Haaretz, a leading Israeli newspaper. He has served as a paratrooper in the Israeli Defense Force and is a commentator on Israeli public television.
Shavit spoke about why he wrote “My Promised Land” and about modern Israel’s perceived challenges. Some of Shavit’s ancestors were early Zionists, a fact which led him to admit he initially wrote the book for personal reasons.
“Almost since I remember myself, definitely since I turned into a young adult, I had the feeling that I was born into a unique nation, that I was born into a unique historical event, and I felt that there is a need for me … to ask myself what is it all about, what is happening that I am taking part of,” Shavit said.
Shavit saw this work, based on his personal experience living in Israel, as filling a niche in the literary world.
“I did not see a book that tries to capture the overall Israel narrative in a personal way, definitely not in the last decades. And as I looked at the shelf again with so many great books there, I came to the conclusion that this is no accident that the reason there is no such book is that we have lost our narrative,” Shavit said. “This is especially troubling in the case of Israel because we were a narrative before we were a nation.”
After discussing his inspiration for the book, Shavit then discussed some contentious issues facing modern Israel. He defended the Zionists but recognized the gravity of Israel’s tensions with its neighbors.
“What you have there in the very beginning are the two elements in my mind that define Israel and the Israeli condition to this day. On the one hand you have the triumph, the most daring, impressive and just project one can imagine, and on the other hand you have the tragic flaw,” Shavit said. “There was nothing evil about it, there was no racism there but there was a tragic flaw built into this project. We went into a country that had other people and we went into a region that is probably the most brutal region on the face of the earth.”
Shavit’s speech was followed by a response from Daniel Schueftan, an Israeli and the director of the National Security Studies Center at the University of Haifa. Shueftan spoke in support of Shavit’s chapter, in which he defends some of Israel’s actions in during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.
In particular, Shavit defended the expulsion of 50,000-70,000 Palestinians from the cities of Lydda and Ramle by Israeli troops.
“Lydda was a tragedy for the Palestinians, [but] Lydda could not have happened had the Arabs taken other choices, and I don’t see this as the dark side of Israel,” Schueftan said. “I see it as something that I would have been delighted had it not happened. I would have been delighted if we could have come into existence without creating a tragedy for the other people, but here I agree that it is historically inevitable if you bring into your historical analysis the attitude of the Arabs.”
After Schueftan’s comments, the event transitioned to a question-and-answer session. Shavit answered queries concerning the trend of falling support for Israel among American college students.
“I take Iran very seriously and I take the occupation [in the West Bank] seriously, [but] I think this issue of building back Israel’s legitimacy [is vital]. … We really have to open peoples’ hearts. This is a world of soft power and it is as if our leaders have not heard about it and we must take action quickly and dramatically to reposition ourselves,” Shavit said.
Many members of the audience had brought their copies of “My Promised Land” to be signed.
“What he was saying was all the stuff that I believed already but not in as clear a way and not in a way that I could have presented nearly as well,” said Tom Goldring, a mathematician for the Department of Defense. He found out about the speaker through Washington Jewish Week.
Throughout the lecture, Shavit emphasized the importance of understanding Israel’s past in context of the region and Jewish history.
“The secret aim was actually to enable people to love Israel again, but in a critical way, in a realistic way, while being aware of Israel’s flaws, Israel’s wrinkles and Israel’s dark sides,” Shavit said.

Religious policy researcher Jonathan Fox discussed church-state relations and secularization at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs on Tuesday afternoon, highlighting government religious policies across the globe.
The event, titled “Political Secularism, Religion and the State” featured Fox, a professor at Bar-IlanUniversity in Ramat Gan, Israel, who specializes in the influence of religion on politics, domestic conflicts and international relations. Fox is the founder and coordinator of the Religion and State project at Bar-Ilan, which seeks to understand the factors that influence religious policy and how it interacts with other political, social and economic factors.
“I have two goals. One is to provide an accurate description of government religion policies worldwide,” Fox said. “Once I have that information, I look at how it affects other political factors and social factors and economic factors as well as how government religion policy is influenced by them.”
As stated by Fox, the RAS project includes statistics from 177 countries, which is every country in the world with a population greater than 250,000. Fox and his colleagues have collected yearly data for every year between 1990 and 2008, and have documented 151 variables for state-related policy and 154 on religion and constitutions.
“I look at four types of religion policies: official religion policy, the extent to which the government supports religion, the extent to which the government regulates all religions in the country and religious discrimination, which I define as restrictions placed on minority religions that are not placed on the majority religion,” Fox said.
Fox discussed the rise and fall of secularization theory, a pervading early 20th-century academic argument that theorized religion’s eventual decline.
“Academics believed secularization theory because they wanted religion to go away, and they didn’t really check their facts,” Fox said. “Secularization theory predicted religions’ extreme decline, and religion has competition now. I just would not call that secularization.”
Fox’s research directly challenges secularization theory. He reasons that while a quarter of the countries in the world have an official religion, there are a number of countries that do not declare an official one, but rather they have one religion that in all other respects gets treated as official by the state.
“This is not what I would call a secular world. If we had a secular world, you’d expect countries to be a little more neutral. Less than 20 percent of the world’s countries are neutral,” Fox said.
Fox discussed his findings on religious policies from the world’s democracies.
“The breakdown for democracies is very similar to the breakdown for the rest of the world. This is not a breakdown that is driven by non-democracies. Democracies resemble the rest of the world in this respect, except less of them are hostile towards religion,” Fox said.
Vebjorn Horsfjord, a researcher at the Center for Christian-Muslim Understanding at the University of Oslo, discussed the advantages of Fox’s approach to political and religious interconnectedness.
“I think what’s fascinating is to do a quantitative study of these questions and go through every country in the world because that is such a huge job and there are so many questions involved. Hearing somebody who’s actually done it is the most interesting thing,” Horsfjord said. “Because of the diversity of questions it’s so difficult to find variables that make it possible to compare different countries, and I think that shows that this is a very ambitious project.”

After Patrick Gage (SFS ’17) arrived at Georgetown and realized that, unlike the College Democrats’ and their publication “The Progressive,” the College Republicans had no official publication, he decided to fill that void with one of his own.
In November, he began to talk to board members about spearheading one for the club, and, on Jan. 13, “The Right Way” was born.
Gage ran his own political blog in high school and felt that the experience qualified him for the job.
“It was something that they had thought of, so I figured, ‘Why don’t I just take this and run with it?’” he said. “I think it was really important also for the club, because the [Georgetown University College] Democrats have been doing it for a couple of years, and I felt that it was important that we not only match that, but try to even do better.”
On any given week, the blog will feature four posts from individual staff writers, including Gage, and one member of the GUCR board. The blog aims to publish well-researched conservative opinions on a wide range of timely issues from women’s rights to anti-abortion stances.
“We’re not aiming to be a news site,” Gage said. “We’re going for an informed editorial, is what I would call it.”
Gage has no requirements for his writers and allows them to choose their own topics.
“From my experience, if you’re told to write about something that you don’t want to write about, you’re not going to write it well. … I think that giving them freedom also really gives us a great diversity of topics other than me just choosing,” he said.
The blog values differences in opinions, including those that may not be traditionally Republican.
“There’s a diversity of opinions in the party, and that’s something you don’t really get from the media,” Gage said. “We’re showing students that Republicans do think differently. We’re not all just machines thinking exactly the same thing at the same time.”
Staff writers have published posts about support for both Israel and Palestine and legalizing marijuana, while Gage has written about opposing the death penalty and supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants.
Staff writer Alex Robledo (COL ’17) also has written about some of these more contentious viewpoints.
“It’s a mixture of what I am personally passionate about, so at least for me I’m really passionate about individual liberty, freedom, so my past articles have been about legalizing marijuana, about being more open and tolerant of gay Americans,” he said.
For Robledo, this is important because he believes college campuses are not always friendly to Republicans.
“I feel like the caricature of Republicans, at least amongst college campuses, is that we’re all of the same mold, and we all agree on the same things,” he said. “Being able to disagree over policy issues, especially within the party, and being able to do that freely, and other people being okay with that, really makes me happy, and I feel like we can learn from each other when we’re able to disagree like that.”
As of Tuesday night, “The Right Way”had received 6,667 page views, with 2,000 unique viewers. These came from 22 countries, with viewers from Jordan composing the second-largest readership after the United States.
“The Right Way” also provides a place for Republicans to express their opinions, which Gage thinks is one of the blog’s most important features.
“We really want to provide Georgetown Republicans a place to share their opinions where we can openly discuss it. It’s a way for students to almost test their opinions also, to kind of put it out there and see what people have to say about it,” he said.
“The Progressive,” which represents GUCD, acts as a platform for liberal and progressive principles, and holds more of a focus on news and current events.
“It’s largely the online newspaper for the College Dems,” Editor-in-Chief Matt Sarge (COL ’14) said. “However, it’s also meant to be a form for all progressive groups on campus, so potentially groups like H*yas for Choice or, in a very broad sense, any progressive leaning group on campus … to write and express their views.”
The online publication, which has 95 pages of articles on its website, has a staff of 12 members, many of whom both write and edit. The site also prioritizes having a steady stream of articles over having a set rotation of writers. They aim to post one to two articles per day, and writers choose their own topics, although the staff also brainstorms ideas at GUCD meetings.
“It gives me an excuse to do a little research into something that interests me during the school week,” staff writer Hayden Frye (COL ’17) said.
Last week, Frye wrote one of the website’s most popular articles, which got about 600 views, on Clay Aiken running for Congress in North Carolina. The daily views on the site range from 100 to a few hundred per day.
“It’s not all opinion and blog. It’s more of an online newspaper than a blog in a sense,” Sarge said. “A lot of articles are well-researched and link to news sites and things.”
In general, the publication supports the mission of the GUCD and follows party policy closely.
“The website speaks both to provide publicity for the College Dems and the things that they’re trying to accomplish and just to espouse the same general principles that the Democratic Party stands for,” Sarge said.
Gage believes “The Right Way” differs from “The Progressive,” in the extent to which each agrees with its respective party’s policy.
“I think ‘The Progressive,’ from what I’ve seen, does a lot to toe the party line,” he said. “I’ve never seen a “Progressive” article that says that opposes gay marriage, for example, or a “Progressive” article that is pro-life.”
Sarge feels his publication’s policy alignment stems naturally from GUCD member’s beliefs.
“We don’t necessarily go extensively out of our way to cater to [a conservative viewpoint] just because, in terms of the staff that we have, they naturally have a certain viewpoint,” Sarge said. “But occasionally they’ll have deviating viewpoints on specific policies, and we don’t in any way try to prevent them from expressing that.”
Occasionally, however, Progressive staff writers do represent dissenting viewpoints, although these are generally on less bipartisan issues.
“Typically when we’ve had people write things that are more dissenting is when there’s not a clear party line on it. We’ve had articles that oppose what President Obama did, in areas like national security issues or drone strikes,” Sarge said.
Sarge also believes that the addition of “The Right Way” to Georgetown’s media and political landscape will help increase dialogue, despite the large difference in size between the two websites.
“The College Dems are a much larger group in comparison. I don’t know how large of a site or a staff they’ll have, but in general I think the more dialogue the better,” Sarge said. “There’s obviously going to be a rivalry in the sense that [GUCD and GUCR] have somewhat opposing missions, but I think having dialogue on the other side can only serve to strengthen the arguments that we make in favor of democratic policy.”
Frye reads “The Right Way” occasionally and also welcomes the competition.
“Their articles are well written. It looks good. It looks professional, and I think it’s important to have both blogs on campus,” he said. “I’m glad that they do because without that you don’t want to have one-sided blogs coming up. You want to have both sides of any issue being represented.”
For Robledo, the size of GUCD is somewhat intimidating, but he hopes that students can still appreciate the views of “The Progressive.”
“Obviously the College Dems are the biggest organization on campus. That’s good for them, but we want to provide Hoyas with a different set of opinions that maybe they haven’t heard or maybe they aren’t really used to hearing,” he said. “We hope that this blog is a way for other people to latch onto our ideas, be exposed to them, maybe they agree with our ideas, maybe they just don’t know it, really just to create a dialogue and to try and make our ideas open to everybody.”

The Georgetown University chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine held numerous events this week, including an exhibit in the Intercultural Center Galleria and a documentary screening to raise awareness for Israeli Apartheid Week.
The events aim to raise awareness of the conditions in the region and to educate college students about the issues facing Palestinian citizens and refugees in Israel and elsewhere.
“What makes it so important is that it is an opportunity for the Palestinian voice to be heard and for us to express the simple truth about their situation without the conversation being shifted away from Palestinians under the guise of ‘balance,’ which really values the needs and desires of their colonizer,” SJP President Leila Shebaro (SFS ’15) said. “When we talk about peace and resolution, we are always talking about it on their terms, never on balanced terms and certainly never on Palestinian terms.”
As the name of the week implies, the group aims to draw attention to Israeli apartheid.
“If you look at U.N.’s definition of apartheid, what Israel is doing fits that completely,” Shebaro said.
“Twenty percent of the population of Israel proper is Palestinian, but they still face discrimination and are second class citizens.” SJP member John Flanagan (SFS ’14) said.
The week’s events featured talks with American Studies Association member Steven Salaita and journalist David Sheen, as well as a screening of the documentary “Five Broken Cameras,” a film about Palestinian non-violent resistance in the West Bank.
The Salaita lecture discussed and supported a boycott of products made in Israel or its settlements.
“As with any boycott, it’s not about the economic facets. It’s more about the symbolic power and empowering the Palestinian people and raising awareness for their situation,” Flanagan said.
The group also built an exhibit in the ICC Galleria to make students aware of the week. The exhibit features a wall, which serves as a representation of the Israeli West Bank Barrier, which has been under construction since 2003.
“It provides a barrier for the permanent, illegal settlements and essentially makes them permanent.” Flanagan said.“It’s a blatant land grab, so we wanted to expose the wall and give people a sense of its symbolic power and also its material power.”
The week’s events elicited responses from other campus groups.
“The oppression that the SJP is seeking to highlight with this week is legitimate and is the same suffering that J-Street is seeking to end,” J Street U Georgetown co-president Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ‘16) said. “The conditions in the West Bank are oppressive and brutal, and the ongoing conditions ought to offend anybody who believes in democratic principals.”
However, Jatovsky said that J Street advocates for a two-state solution, which is not generally accepted by members of the SJP, according to Shebaro. Additionally, Jatovsky expressed concerns regarding the choice of the word “apartheid” to describe the situation in Israel.
“While there may be some commonalities, to apply the word ‘apartheid’ to Israel misuses and cheapens the term.” Jatovsky said. “We believe it oversimplifies a very complex issue into zero-sum, good versus bad issue.”
Some Jewish students on campus also expressed dismay over the presentation.
“It’s very personal for me, the way that my country is being portrayed,” Georgetown Israel Alliance Vice President Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16), who formerly served as president of the organization, said.
Gabai is also an Israeli citizen who served in the Israeli Defense Force from 2008 to 2011.
“Completely negating Israel’s existence is counterproductive and completely polarizes the entire hope for peace in the region,” Gabai said. “Both sides have a stake in this, both sides should have a seat at the negotiating table, and both sides should have a right to exist. It’s not all or nothing.”
SJP, J Street U and GIA previously attempted a collaborative movie event in November but withdrew organizational support after SJP backed out, citing differences irreconcilable with their platform. Members from all three organizations still attended the program as individuals.

Several Georgetown students and professors took part in the 2014 American Israel Public Affairs Committee Policy Conference Sunday through Tuesday, held at the Washington Convention Center.
Despite Monday’s snowstorm, the AIPAC conference amassed over 14,000 delegates in attendance and featured speakers such as Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), Representative Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
AIPAC, a lobbying group that promotes a strong U.S. relationship with Israel, is widely considered to be a strong force in shaping how the U.S government relates to Israel.
About 10 Georgetown students attended the conference and six Georgetown professors led breakout sessions following the major speakers on specialized topics, such as Israeli innovation in missile defense.
“The coolest part about the conference is not just the learning you have in sessions you sit through, but it’s in the relationships you have,” Michail Woods (SFS ’14) said. “Because you have people, from Latinos to African-Americans to evangelical Christians to, obviously, Jews, from all over the United States, and a lot of people come from even overseas to come together for one thing. … We all come together to support a strong U.S.-Israel relationship.”
Additionally, Woods said the conference functioned as a quasi-training session for the next generation’s AIPAC leaders.
“Any organization, to maintain its leadership, it’s like a showcase to say this is what we’re doing, these are the issues we need to be passionate about; and this is essentially why this organization still matters to you and why you should still be a part of it,” Woods said.
Josh Goldberg  (COL ’17) additionally felt the conference allowed attendees a chance to showcase prominent leaders in the field.
“I attended the AIPAC Policy Conference because I am interested in getting a better understanding of U.S.-Israel relations and the ongoing political issues in the Middle East. … I really enjoyed the conference because it was a good opportunity to hear many national speakers and to take advantage of being in a university in the nation’s capital,” Goldberg wrote in an email.
For Goldberg, who attended a breakout session about Middle East Politics, the conference allowed him to get more involved with the issues at hand.
“I hope to get further involved in AIPAC and learn what I can do to help promote U.S.-Israel relations,” Goldberg said.
This winter, AIPAC lobbied Congress to pass sanctions on Iran, although this effort failed.
“One of the main points of the conference, to get a member of Congress and raise awareness for it, is the issue of Iran,” Woods said. “Marrying a radical regime with weapons of mass destruction is a recipe for disaster.”
As a nonprofit, Georgetown cannot contribute money to any PACs, but it can and does provide resources for students to attend conferences such as the AIPAC conference.
“As a rabbi and director of the Jewish Chaplaincy, perhaps my primary role is to nurture and support the development of Jewish students, Judaism and their Jewish identity,” Rabbi Rachel Gartner said. “And for many of our Jewish students, a relationship with Israel is a core part of that identity. And for some, it is not; the focus of their Judaism is on their American-Jewish experience.”
In the past, Georgetown and the Jewish chaplaincy supported student trips ranging from the Jewish Film Festival and seeing Klezmer at the Kennedy Center to more politically oriented events like theAIPAC conference and the J Street conference.
“My approach to the AIPAC conference, to the J Street conference, is to be supportive of any students who come forward and say, ‘Hey, I want to go, but I don’t have the finances’ or, ‘Hey, I want to go, but I don’t know anybody else who’s going, do you know who’s going?’ So I share information and also support them with resources and subsidies,” Gartner said.
The crowd of 14,000, the largest gathering of America’s pro-Israel community, according to AIPAC’swebsite, consisted of approximately 2,200 college students and included about two-thirds of Congress.
“I’m not a big fan of the term pro-Israel or the term anti-Israel,” Gartner said. “Because I think it oversimplifies the range of ways that people can be pro-Israel and, I’m sure, the range of ways that people can be anti-Israel as well.”

With Monday’s announcement of its Myriad Voices, a cross-cultural festival spanning more than two years, the Laboratory of Global Performance and Politics continues its goal of bringing together performance and theater with international affairs.
The dual vision of Cynthia Schneider, professor of diplomacy in the School of Foreign Service, and Derek Goldman, professor of theater and performance studies and artistic director of the Davis Performing Arts Center, saw the founding of the Lab, as it is commonly known, almost a year ago.
Schneider outlined a three-pronged approach to achieving the Lab’s goals of examining the intersection of theater and politics. The approach began by holding policy conversations about performances from abroad.
“We also are creating new work with our students here and having them engage with students and other people of their age in other parts of the world,” Schneider said.
The second step of the approach includes student work on the subjects presented, culminating with courses taught jointly by the two professors, attended by both students from the School of Foreign Service and the department of theater and performance studies.
The Lab’s inception stemmed from Schneider and Goldman’s commonalities. Both felt a need for the Lab when they hosted a conference in the summer of 2012 with the use of a Reflective Engagement in the Public Interest grant, bringing together people interested in the topics of theater and international affairs.
“We saw from that gathering that there was a tremendous interest and need,” Schneider said. “There are many, many other people interested in this intersection, and they had nowhere else to go. I do believe our program is unique, and so we attract a lot of interest from outside.”
The specific focus of the Lab positions it as a leader and resource in the field.
“It was out of these conversations that this vision for this partnership between theater and performance studies and the School of Foreign Service came, being a resource center for the field, being a convening space for our students in the curriculum and in programming, and really trying to bring the arts and policy world together in deeper dialogue,” Goldman said.
Goldman pointed to the energy at Georgetown with its commitment to politics, social justice and cura personalis as the perfect breeding ground for the initiative.
Over the past year, the Lab hosted theater groups from abroad for performances aiming to explore politics more deeply. Schneider highlighted the Freedom Theatre, a group from a refugee camp in Palestine who adapted the play “The Island,” a South African piece about apartheid, as a perfect example of the benefits of the Lab. The group performed at Georgetown in September.
“If it was just presented as a lecture, maybe nobody would have believed him. But instead what they saw was the story of two people in prison — and saw what that was like, their hopes, their fears, their dreams,” she said. “You learn through someone’s stories. … The most effective way — and this is just a neurological fact — to impact someone is through a story. So presenting this material in the context of play was such a powerful way to do it.”
Students who attended the event were awed by its intensely personal nature.
“Seeing ‘The Island’ taken out of its South African context and dropped into the Israeli-Palestinian situation was pretty powerful and pretty provocative, and that it was happening in the U.S. capital raised the intensity of the conversation taking place,” Ben Card (COL ’17) said. “Being in the same space as a performance humanizes politics in a way that rarely happens.”
In addition to the performances themselves, Schneider referenced policy discussions after the theatrical display as critical to the Lab, pointing to an example of Madeleine Albright speaking on her experience with Václav Havel, the first president of the Czech Republic, after “Anticodes,” a performance based on Havel’s poetry, in December.
Both professors noted that the end goal of the Lab is to use the performances to humanize and expand traditional understandings of politics, which often just focus on issues.
“Theater, because of its narrative dimensions, because of its live, interpersonal dimensions, has a real and human contact. It’s much harder in that context to dismiss the human dimensions of stories,” Goldman said.
Schneider combatted any skepticism of the medium of theater by highlighting the performance’s allowance for greater integration.
“I recognize that we’re at the School of Foreign Service. We’re not at the London School of Drama,” Schneider added. “I want the information that the people get through the performances then to be integrated into the knowledge they have already and will gain going forward about the particular subject.”
With positive feedback received from both Georgetown and the broader community thus far, the Laboratory will progress with Myriad Voices, a project involving a number of events aimed to increase understanding of majority-Muslim populations around the world.

A panel of leading Middle East experts spoke about the current Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in the Reiss Science Building on Wednesday. The panel included Ambassador Dennis Ross, Ghaith Al-Omari and Jeremy Ben-Ami.
The event was sponsored by J Street U Georgetown, the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, Georgetown College Democrats and the Georgetown Program for Jewish Civilization.
“[The] panel was a strong step in advancing constructive conversations at Georgetown surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” J Street U Treasurer Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16), who moderated the panel, wrote in an email. “It is the nuanced insight like that provided at the panel that can bridge gaps and lead to meaningful progression.”
Executive Director of the American Task Force on Palestine Al-Omari spoke out against the costs of the conflict.
“This is not a conflict we can afford to keep dragging on,” Al-Omari said. “We have seen many lives shattered by this conflict.”
Ambassador Ross, who is currently a professor in the School of Foreign Service, played a leading role in shaping U.S. involvement in the Middle East peace process under the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Ross explained the personal nature of the peace process.
“In an abstract way, you contribute to something called stability, but it’s completely abstract,” Ross said. “When I began to negotiate in the Middle East, I went from dealing with issues that were abstract to issues that were highly personal.”
Ben-Ami is founder and president of J Street, a pro-peace organization that advocates a two-state solution as the means for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ben-Ami expressed a need for third-party involvement in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
“There has to be two states for two people, or else Israel loses fundamental character,” Ben-Ami said. “That simply isn’t going to happen without American involvement.”
Al-Omari echoed Ben-Ami’s commentary.
“Without a responsible third party, the two parties cannot get to it,” Al-Omari said. “They are unable to step back and do what they need to do to get out of the conflict.”
With an American-brokered peace framework soon to be presented to Israeli and Palestinian leaders, each panelist weighed in on the prospective two-state solution.
“I don’t believe if you miss this moment, it’s the end,” Ross said. “But I don’t think if you miss this moment, it’s a good thing.”
Ben-Ami and Al-Omari agreed that there is no viable alternative to a two-state solution.
“I do not see any other solution,” Al-Omari said. “One of the biggest concerns that I have is, those of us who would be in favor of a two-state solution … we will not be motivated, but the others who are against it will be very motivated.”
Although the panelists represented a varied array of backgrounds, they all agreed on the importance of a two-state solution.
“The fact that these three leading Middle East experts, despite their diverse backgrounds, found so much agreement demonstrates the wide-spread support for and recognition that the two-state solution is the key to this conflict’s resolution,” Jatovsky said.
The panelists discussed whether Secretary of State John Kerry, who is currently in Jordan brokering a peace between Israel and Palestine, could achieve a successful solution.
“Even if Kerry produces a breakthrough, I think unless a breakthrough is accompanied by immediate steps by both sides to address the sources of disbelief, a breakthrough won’t happen right now any case,” Ross said.
Al-Omari argued that Israeli and Palestinian governments are perpetuating cynicism in the region.
“Yes, there is a lot they can do and no they are not doing it,” Al-Omari said.“Part of it is saying this is a good thing and part of it is distancing themselves.”
Al-Omari predicted that a watered-down document will be a consequence of this incompetence.
“The trick of what needs to be done is how do you get the parties — the leaders themselves — to accept this, own it and to identify this success as their success in political terms and the failure as their failure,” Al-Omari said.
Ultimately, the panelists were not optimistic about the current peace negotiations.
“I think one of the great risks of this round of talks is that one of the few strands of progress can collapse,” Ben-Ami said. “The odds are that this doesn’t move forward.”
Ross explained that the regional culture and environment are important factors that need to change in order for an agreement to become more realistic.
“We do need to be doing things on the ground to change the climate so, when we buy the time, people have room to say, ‘Maybe there’s something going on in Israel,’” Ross said. “That’s the challenge we have right now.
Al-Omari disagreed with the other panelists about whether either party needs to desert its narrative in order to facilitate an agreement.
“I do not believe you should negotiate identity,” Al-Omari said. “Both sides need to show sensitivity.”
The panelists concluded on a positive note — a solution is possible regardless of whether the current talks are successful.
“[In the Middle East], what can go wrong usually goes wrong so I can’t sit up here and say, ‘I know it’s going to happen,’” Ross said.“But I can say, when all three sides don’t want a collapse, usually they find a way to manage.”

Former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) delivered the second lecture in his Georgetown series Wednesday, focusing on the importance of understanding policy in broader political debates.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unexpectedly attended the event, sitting next to University President John J. DeGioia and her former chief of staff, Ambassador Melanne Verveer, who is now executive director of Georgetown’s Institute for Women, Peace and Security. Hillary Clinton was last on campus in February to present the 2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton Awards for Advancing Women in Peace and Security. Many former Clinton aides also attended the lecture in Gaston Hall.
When he took the stage, Clinton joked about his wife’s presence.
“It’s been a long time,” he said. “She hasn’t had to sit through one of these in ages.”
This year’s event took place one year to the date after Clinton’s first speech in the series, which covered influences on Clinton’s political views and his commitment to public service. Clinton will give two more lectures in the series over the next few years. The next will focus on politics, he said today.
In his lecture, Clinton covered three main policies: economic strategy during his time in office, welfare reform and peace processes in the Middle East. The bulk of the lecture focused on economic policy, comparing details from Clinton’s terms to the economic situation after the 2008 financial crisis.
Throughout his speech, Clinton compared the “storyline” of a policy to its effects and details, criticizing media coverage of the Affordable Care Act and policies from his terms, including the 1993 budget, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act and his increase of the earned income tax credit.
“If a policymaker is a political leader and is covered primarily by the political press, there is a craving that borders on addictive to have a storyline,” Clinton said. “And then once people settle on the storyline, there is a craving that borders on blindness to shoehorn every fact, every development, every thing that happens into the storyline, even if it’s not the story.”
Throughout the portion of his speech devoted to economics, Clinton incorporated charts and graphs, pointing to a PowerPoint slideshow with occasional technical difficulties. One graph compared growth during Clinton’s administration to growth under President Ronald Reagan, which Clinton used in his criticism of supply-side economics.
“We had a plan that restored fiscal responsibility, increased investment where it would do the most economic good and structured the tax system and a lot of our programs to lift middle class wages,” Clinton said. “I made deals when necessary, but I’ll talk about that next time.”
In his discussion of his 1996 welfare reform, Clinton also compared the dominant “storyline” to his experience, pointing out that he had worked on welfare reform since 1980 as governor of Arkansas.
“The storyline when I signed the welfare reform bill was, ‘The Republicans have got Clinton now, they forced him to sign this horrible bill because he wants to get re-elected,’” Clinton said.  “Now, the facts were different.”
Clinton ended by talking about peace processes in the Middle East, he said, “because they’re relevant to today and I think I almost never hear it reported accurately.”
Of peace processes, Clinton said it is most important for negotiators to realize, “It’s not about you — it’s about them.”
He referenced his time negotiating peace in Ireland and Kosovo before discussing his efforts as a peacemaker between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat in 2000.
After the lecture, Diondra Hicks (COL ’15) led a question-and-answer session with Clinton, for which questions were screened in advance, as they were for lectures by Associate Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) earlier this year.  A faculty member from the Speech and Expression Committee, the president of the Georgetown University Lecture Fund and a Clinton staffer chose questions that covered science and technology, the effects of an aging U.S. population and economic growth in areas that have been especially hurt by the recession.
Because of the lecture series’ theme of “a life in public service,” the Clinton Foundation chose Hicks to moderate the question-and-answer session from a list of students involved in social justice provided by Student Affairs and the Center for Social Justice, according to Maggie Moore, communications officer for arts and sciences. Last year’s question-and-answer period with Clinton was led by former Georgetown University Student Association President Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13).
Students began lining up in earnest around 4:30 a.m. for the 10:30 a.m. lecture. Emily Stephens (SFS ’17) and Matt Martin (COL ’16) were the first in line at 3 a.m., ending up with seats in the back of Gaston Hall’s ground floor.
“I think it was worth it,” Martin said. “I loved the surprise Hillary appearance.”

“If a policymaker is a political leader and is covered primarily by the political press, there is a craving that borders on addictive to have a storyline,” Clinton said. “And then once people settle on the storyline, there is a craving that borders on blindness to shoehorn every fact, every development, every thing that happens into the story line, even if it’s not the story.”
Well that’s certainly true–but criticism of the disaster of Obamacare is the only thing close to honest reporting produced by the mainstream media lately. What a snake.
P.S. I wonder who the Georgetown administration wants to elect in 2016?

Matt Martin says 
April 30, 2014 at 8:43 pm
Clarification: Emily Stephens & I – and our friend, Casey Nolan – weren’t actually at the front of the line. We arrived at the scene before anyone had began to wait in line (3:00 a.m.), but given the weather we decided to wait it out in Pierce, while keeping a close eye on line to make sure it didn’t get too long before we would decide to head out & brave the weather. We parted with the dryness & warmth of Pierce at 5:45 a.m. with the conclusion that the extra time we spent inside was worth allowing 70 or so people to stand in line ahead of us.

AMMAN, Jordan — As tensions mounted in the Levant this summer, 14 Georgetown students participated in the Office of Global Education’s inaugural Summer in Amman, Jordan, program.
Shortly after the program’s start on June 6, turmoil began to escalate dramatically in the neighboring countries of Iraq and Israel and in the nearby Gaza Strip.
 
The Looming Threat of ISIS
Less than a week after Georgetown students arrived in Amman, jihadists from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria began their campaign in Iraq by seizing the northern city of Mosul.
The extremist group is currently active in Iraq and Syria but has identified Jordan as a future target. Despite public threats made by ISIS leaders in mid-June to invade Jordan and “slaughter” King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein (MSFS ’87), students said that they did not feel a sense of imminent danger in Amman.
“I have never felt that the situation in Jordan could drastically and quickly change and become dangerous because of any personal experience or the things that I saw or the people that I met,” Amin Gharad (COL ’16) said. “At the end of the day, it was only the news I would hear about things going on all around that would cause me to fear things going down here.”
Although many Georgetown students were startled by reports of the group’s advances in Iraq, such as when it briefly gained control of the border crossing between Iraq and Jordan, locals seemed to be less concerned about ISIS’s potential military impact in Jordan. Amman is separated from the Iraqi border by nearly 200 miles of desert.
“The locals constantly talk about what’s going on, but whenever they talk about ISIS, they might talk about it in a sort of … matter of fact way, or they would even joke about it,” Rabia Mirza (COL ’16) said.
An ideology that is compatible with that of ISIS has not emerged on a large scale in Jordan, even as the group makes gains in Syria and Iraq.
“Right now, [Jordanians] are trying to be moderate in their approach. Everyone is trying to avoid being connected to ISIS in any way. … They don’t want it to come into Jordan, so there is an emphasis on the fact that Jordan is the only country right now that has stability in the region,” Yasmine Abu Tarboush, an Amman resident, said.
According to Abu Tarboush, 26, many Jordanians feel that the ideological threat posed by ISIS has the potential to be much more dangerous in Jordan than any military threat.
“People fear that it is going to become a mentality. They don’t fear that it’s going to be a security-related issue, because they realize that the intellectual aspect is what matters,” Abu Tarboush said.
Jordan plays host to hundreds of thousands of registered refugees from Syria and Iraq.
 
Turmoil in Gaza 
A much more palpable shift in morale occurred in Jordan in mid-June as tensions rose between Israel and Gaza following the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers and the subsequent murder of a Palestinian teenager. Today marks the 29th day of Israel’s Operation Protective Edge, a series of air strikes couples with a ground offensive into Gaza.
Jordan entered into a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 but popular opinion within the country generally favors Palestine. More than half of Jordan’s population of roughly 8 million identifies as Palestinian, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency estimates that there are 2 million registered Palestinian refugees within the borders of the Hashemite kingdom.
“What’s going on in Gaza has heavily impacted the citizens here, considering most of Amman’s population is of Palestinian descent. Whether they’re from Gaza or not, they express strong support and grieve for what’s going on, especially during Ramadan,” Mirza said. “A lot of people here could not properly, joyfully celebrate Eid in the way that they would have liked to.”
Although they are physically separated from the ongoing violence, many Jordanians have experienced a personal impact from Israel’s attacks on Gaza.
“I know people in Gaza and everyone in Jordan at least knows someone who knows someone in Gaza. To them, it feels personal. It doesn’t feel like it’s another country or that we should remain calm and stay out of it,” Abu Tarboush said.
Thousands of Jordanians attended a number of protests in Amman and other Jordanian cities throughout the second half of July, expressing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and calling for Hamas to strengthen its offensive against Israel.
Georgetown students are not permitted to take part in political demonstrations under the conditions of the study abroad program.
“I personally will stay away from protests. I know that there are certain mosques that you shouldn’t go to on Fridays because after Friday prayer, people stay outside and protest,” Zaynab Malik (COL ’16) said. “Being at the right place at the right time is very important here. Things can get out of hand.”
Many protestors also condemned the U.S. government for its continued support of Israel.
Although public opinion in Jordan is largely opposed to the U.S. government’s pro-Israel stance, students said that they do not feel that their status as Americans has affected their interactions with Jordanians.
“In Arab culture, they do not reflect their views about the government against the people, so it’s not like I’ve had any issues, but [Jordanians] will openly express their disapproval of the American government’s policies,” Mirza said.
 
Stability Amid Unrest
The summer program in Amman, which incorporates intensive Modern Standard Arabic studies at the second and third levels, replaced a similar summer program in Alexandria, Egypt, that was cancelled last April due to increasing political unrest within the country.
Jordan’s continued political stability in the face of mounting tensions in the region has deterred any significant security concerns comparable to those that spurred the cancellation of the Alexandria program. Georgetown students are prohibited from leaving Jordan and travelling around the region throughout the nine-week program.
“Last summer, I was upset when they cancelled the Egypt program, but I know that they did it for the right reasons and in retrospect it was the right choice,” Malik, who had planned to attend the Alexandria program last year, said. “Because I’ve had experience with that, I know that Georgetown is taking everything here seriously and if we were threatened even in the slightest way, I know that we would be evacuated.”
Although Jordan has remained stable and secure until this point, the tensions surrounding the country raise concerns about the future for many Jordanians.
“[In Jordan], we are just waiting. We expect that something horrible is going to happen, but we don’t know what it is,” Abu Tarboush said. “The threats are too many.”

After receiving 13 professors’ signatures, Georgetown has become the most-represented university involved in the American Studies Association’s boycott of Israeli academic institutions since the petition’s creation last month.
Georgetown professors who signed the boycott petition include Center for Contemporary Arab Studies Director Osama Abi-Mershed, Founding Director of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding John Esposito, Yvonne Haddad and Judith Tucker, among other signatories.
The boycott is a part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, which aims to aid Palestinian civil society by increasing economic and political pressure on Israel. The academic petition came as a response to recent turmoil regarding the Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
Columbia University, New York University and the University of California at Berkeley follow Georgetown in representation, with 11, nine and nine signatures, respectively.
“Israeli academic institutions function as a central part of a system that has denied Palestinians their basic rights. Palestinian students face ongoing discrimination, including the suppression of Palestinian cultural events, and there is sanctioning and ongoing surveillance of Palestinian students and faculty who protest Israeli policies,” ASA’s website states.
The petition’s signatories pledge that they will not publish in Israeli academic journals, teach at Israeli institutions, attend conferences at Israeli universities or work on any projects with Israeli academic institutions.
Haddad said she signed the petition in order to expand universal academic freedom and push for peace in the region.
“I signed it because the war was promoted as Israel defending itself when in fact it was defending the longest occupation and degradation of the Palestinian population. I signed it in the hope that it would bring pressure on Israeli institutions in order to provide space for academic freedom for Israeli and Palestinian academics who are not allowed to deviate from the hasbara [public diplomacy] of the state,” Haddad wrote in an email. “[The petition]  aimed to endorse the few Israelis and the growing number of Jewish American voices that have called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and the respect for the human rights of Palestinians whose academic institutions are raided by the Israeli military and whose classes are suspended at the whim of the occupation authorities.”
Esposito said he believed the boycott could help prevent violations of Palestinian rights.
“[I hope] to put pressure on and to boycott institutions that violate international law and as a result violate the rights of Palestinians,” Esposito wrote in an email. “There can be no excuse for the cycle of violence that has taken so many lives in Palestine/Israel over the years, and terrorized both Palestinians and Israelis, and most recently in Gaza, the slaughter of so many innocent civilians, especially women and children must be stopped.”
Tucker, who has visited the area many times since the 1980s, said she has seen the problems that Palestinian students and professors face firsthand.
“I’ve seen the situation on the ground, particularly from the vantage point of colleagues, Palestinian academics, who really have suffered enormously over the years,” Tucker said. “They can’t get books, their students can’t get to campus. These have been ongoing endemic conditions under which they live. Of course, it sometimes becomes much more critical than that when there is an active period of bombing or attacks.”
Tucker, a history professor who specializes in the Middle East, said that she believes that pledging her signature is one of the best ways she can contribute to a cause in which she believes.
“The idea is that after this long period of time, there’s been virtually no movement on getting any closer to a resolution of this conflict. How can people abroad like myself make some kind of contribution to the cause of getting a just resolution? It’s not going to come about, it would seem, through negotiations on the ground, which have stalled for many, many years,” Tucker said.
Tucker, Haddad and Esposito said that their involvement in the boycott will in no way affect their roles as professors at the university.
“Signing the petition was a personal choice and has nothing to do with my professional activity at the university,” wrote Haddad, who teaches the history of Islam and Christian-Muslim relations. “I did not speak for the university, its faculty or its administration. I will continue to teach both the Palestinian and Israeli positions. Being censored and forced to teach exclusively the Israeli position as the only truth would shortchange our students, who are being trained to be the future leaders of America.”
“They’re very separate,” Tucker said about her personal views and her professional life. “I’ve been teaching Middle East history at Georgetown for many years, and my personal views have absolutely no purchase in the classroom. For me, it’s a non-issue. I would never feel that my students should think like I do or take positions like I do on any issue.”
Georgetown professors signed similar boycott petitions in December 2013 and in 2007. University President John J. DeGioia commented on both previous boycotts, but has yet to comment on this boycott. In 2013, DeGioia expressed opposition to the boycott, but support for academic freedom of speech.
“The recent resolution of the American Studies Association endorsing a boycott of Israeli universities undermines the academic freedom that is essential to the mission of the Academy. … I recognize these are matters on which colleagues can disagree,” DeGioia wrote in a statement last year. “While the position of our university remains opposed to any boycott, we will certainly defend the rights of those who disagree.”
Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16), Israeli student and former Georgetown Israel Alliance president, said that he agreed with DeGioia’s statement and now worries about a lack of academic freedom and discussion between opposing sides.
“I am very concerned by what would happen with the void that would be left after pushing out Israeli scholars and universities from the conversation,” Gabai said. “Without someone on the other side to ever give counterarguments or to ever check and balance the accusations that are made on one side or the other, there’s just so much room to go with extreme opinions and go with actions that lose every proportion possible.”

Counterterrorism expert Jonathan Schanzer said Palestinian politics are overlooked in the field of Middle Eastern studies in a lecture in White-Gravenor Hall on Wednesday.
The event was co-sponsored by the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs and the Georgetown Israel Alliance.
During his talk, Schanzer emphasized the fact that many people who study the Israel-Palestine conflict do so in a one-sided manner.
“Most people study the Middle East by the Israeli perspective, or the perspective of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some people might have studied the Palestinian system, but that is extremely rare,” Schanzer said.
GIA Co-President Jessica Tannenbaum (COL ’16), a staff writer for The Guide, said that she appreciated Schanzer’s perspective. 
“I think it was important for him to shift the focus just from looking at the Israeli perspective, to looking at the Palestinian perspective as well, because in order to understand this conflict, we need to look at both sides,” Tannenbaum said.
Schanzer also said he believes that having an understanding of the Palestinian political system is crucial to developing an understanding of the region, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the Israel-Palestine conflict and other major issues ongoing in the Middle East.
“The term that is used right now, a derisive term, is called linkage. If you just solved the Israel-Palestinian conflict you might be able to prevent Iran from going nuclear, the civil war in Syria and the tumult from the Arab Spring,” Schanzer said. “You might be able to prevent many things by just getting down to the core of providing the Palestinians with the state that they so desire and have been agitating for since the 1940s.”
Schanzer noted the division of the Palestinian government and how the two-state solution, which proposes the creation of two separate and autonomous states of Israel and Palestine, ignores that the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are two distinct entities separated by a barrier that Palestinians are virtually unable to cross.
“You have the Gaza strip being controlled by the Hamas and the West Bank by Fatah,” Schanzer said. “These are two separate governments, two separate funding sources, two separate police and security apparatus. These two states have not been able to agree on anything, and yet, all we have been talking about in Washington is a two-state solution.”
Event attendee Sydney Jean Gottfried (COL ’17) said that she felt like this distinction cleared up a misconception that many Americans have about Palestine.
“I thought that it was really interesting to bring to light how in Palestine there are two sides, with the Hamas and the Fatah and I think that most people don’t see that,” Gottfried said. “They just see Israel and Palestine and it can be hard to understand that within Palestine there is not a united front.”
Ian Philbrick (COL ’17), GJIA’s undergraduate online executive editor, said he agrees that there is a problem with how we narratively frame the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“The way that it is depicted in the media and the way we understand the situation as policymakers or even students is not necessary true to the situation on the ground,” Philbrick said. “There is a very dangerous disconnect between what is actually happening and the policy that we recommend.”
Schanzer called for the opening up of the Palestinian political system in order to make room for innovative leaders.
“The bottom line is that Palestinians across the board don’t like their leadership and there does not appear to be any leaders in the making,” Schanzer said. “Even if there were elections tomorrow, it is impossible to tell who would be the next layer of leadership. We are looking for the next Martin Luther King or the next Mahatma Gandhi. We need to open up the political space, and this is something that we continue to ignore.”
During a question and answer session that followed the lecture, Schanzer addressed the issues of terrorism and the threat of the Islamic State group.
“There is a common denominator across ISIS, Hamas and al-Qaida, which is a radical brand of Islam,” Schanzer said. “This is not Islam itself, it is an interpretation of Islam, which the majority of Muslims reject. I believe that the biggest fight that we are all going to face is this ideology, the fact that ISIS is drawing numbers of people and has such an allure.”
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), who attended the event, said he was satisfied with the objective view that Schanzer presented in his lecture.
“So much of the narrative around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is driven by biased and emotional content in the mainstream media and so, hearing from an objective, experienced, research fellow like Dr. Schanzer gives a greater degree of legitimacy to the discussion and allows us to focus on what is really important,” Goldstein said.

In commemoration of the lives lost during this summer’s conflict between Israel and Hamas, J Street U Georgetown hosted an apolitical candlelight vigil in Red Square in an attempt to humanize the usually politicized debate.
With the media coverage of the violence filled with statistics, J Street U wanted to focus on empathy for the human loss.
“Now many of us here, myself included, found this simple and human idea of empathy and compassion incredibly difficult to express this summer. The intense polarization of an already highly political and politicized issue often prohibited any sense of sympathy for the other side and perpetuated the idea that any such sympathy was a sign of wavering loyalty and betrayal,” J Street U Co-President Katelyn McNelis (SFS ’15) said. “Tonight we recognize that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while inherently political, transcends politics.”
Although J Street U, which promotes a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, does have a political stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they found it important that the event eschewed a political nature.
“We also do have strong political stances that we are not scared to take, but for this event we wanted to kind of put that aside and show that there was a human aspect to this that wasn’t really being shown this summer,” McNelis said. “All that was being shown was destruction and rockets but they weren’t showing the actual humanity behind what happened after and before the destruction.”
The event included narrative accounts of life for people affected by the violence. One story included that of a family bombed whose father was worried about the overwhelming fear of his children.
“‘I have learned from past experience not to let the kids see the damage that the rockets cause because it can be very traumatic,’” Noah Buyon (COL ’17), a member of the organization’s board of directors, said as a narrator.
The event was also an attempt to show that even in a polarized debate, it is possible to rise above politics to a focus on the human aspect.
“People tend to see this conflict in black and white terms and there’s a good side and a bad side and this event kind of marks a transcendence of that worldview in my mind. The way I see it, if even one person dies, it’s one person too many and so this is a very nice way of building off of that sentiment,” Buyon said.
The inability to empathize with the conflict on a more human level was in large part due to the media coverage.
“When I could see myself following the news, it was just so hard to really put it in a human perspective because after a while all you saw was numbers and all you saw was the amount of rocket attacks and the number of people killed and you kind of lost the idea that that number was a person,” McNelis said.
Mitchel Hochberg (SFS ’15), who attended the vigil, said that is gave him an opportunity to reflect on the events of the summer.
“Discussion of last summer’s conflict became incredibly polarized,” Hochberg wrote in an email. “Having a safe space to set that aside helped me remember that humanity and compassion should drive our response to needless violence.”

Are people who support Hamas akin to people who supported the Nazis?
Seems to me they are.  
Nazis destroyed all the Jews of Europe.  Hamas never stops talking about destroying Jews.  
Nazis depicted Jews as beneath contempt just as Hamas does.  Nazis blamed Jews for all their problems and so does Hamas.
Seems to me the only difference is Hamas does not have the military required to really kill off all the Jews of Israel.  If they did have these weapons everyone knows they would use them as indiscriminately as the Nazis did.
I wonder what sort of person supports an organization that is today’s Nazis.  What moral and intellectual blindness do these Nazi worshippers suffer from?

Rabbi Barry Freundel, an Orthodox Jewish rabbi for the Georgetown neighborhood’s Kesher Israel congregation who taught at the Georgetown University Law Center and other local universities, was arrested on charges of voyeurism Tuesday.
Freundel allegedly installed a recording device in the women’s mikvah, a private ritual bath, at the Kesher Israel Orthodox synagogue, located at 2801 N St. He pled not guilty to six counts of voyeurism in D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday.
Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson Gwendolyn Crump said the case is still under investigation.
According to GULC spokesperson Elissa Free, Freundel has served as an adjunct law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center since the early 1990s, teaching a seminar on Jewish law, but is not teaching this semester. Free did not specify when Freundel last taught at the university.
According to the MPD police report, a 35-year-old female observed Freundel installing the recording device Sept. 28, which was in the form of a black radio clock called a Dream Machine. Freundel stated that he was using the clock radio for ventilation in the shower. The Washington Post reported that police found recordings of six women on two separate dates in 2014.
Freundel, 62, has been suspended without pay from the synagogue and from his position as the Rav Hamachshir, overseer of the mikvah.
“This is a painful moment for Kesher Israel Congregation and the entire Jewish community. At this challenging time, we draw strength from our faith, our tradition, and our fellow congregants,” the synagogue’s board of directors said in a statement. “Upon receiving information regarding potentially inappropriate activity, the board of directors quickly alerted the appropriate officials. Throughout the investigation, we cooperated fully with law enforcement and will continue to do so.”
Gabi Rubin (COL ’15), former president and current social chair of the Jewish Students Association, described the mikvah as a private, reflective spiritual experience for both Jewish men and women. Mikvahs are often used by Orthodox Jewish women each month after their menstrual cycles, as well as by converts and by brides and grooms before the wedding.
“It’s a time to look into yourself and to better understand yourself and reflect on your relationship with God,” Rubin said. “It’s a place for ritual reflection and renewal.”
She said that the mikvah is about purity, and that it should never be sexualized.
“It’s a very personal, very individual, entirely non-sexual experience when you are with yourself and looking at yourself as you are. You’re naked, in the way that you would when you bathe, but it’s more of a nakedness of spirit and of body,” she said.
In addition to his role as rabbi and past position as a Georgetown professor, Freundel is also vice president of the Vaad, a council of rabbis, in Washington, D.C., and formerly led the Rabbinical Council of America, a national organization of Orthodox rabbis, in addition to serving as a consultant on ethics to the National Institutes of Health.
The judge ordered that he be released from custody until his hearing Nov. 12.

A group of protesters gathered outside the Sabra Hummus House pop-up shop on Wisconsin Avenue NW Monday evening to protest the company owners’ support of the Golani brigade of the Israeli army, in a demonstration organized by the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation.
In the intermittent rain, protesters gathered in front of the store around 6:30 p.m. carrying a large Palestinian flag and signs denouncing the store for supporting human rights violations in Palestine.
“Sabra supports the Gaza siege: let Gaza live … let Gaza breathe,” protestors chanted.
According to its website, Sabra is owned by PepsiCo, based in the U.S., and by the Strauss Group, an Israeli food company that has provided for the Golani Brigade, a fraction of Israel’s military. In addition to the Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the protesters also said that they were protesting the brigade’s “racist” T-shirts, one depicting a pregnant Muslim woman in cross hairs that read “1 shot, 2 kills,” according to the protest’s event description.
A spokesperson for the company told The New York Times in 2010 that Sabra had never contributed “hummus or anything else” to the Israeli military. Sabra faced similar pushback in 2010, when Palestinian students at Princeton and DePaul Universities protested the sale of Sabra hummus on their campuses.
“The company has no political positions or affiliations,” Sabra wrote in a comment.
In response to the protest, one customer showed his support for Israel by wearing an Israeli flag like a cape as he walked past the protesters on his way inside of the store. Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), a board member of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, said that the organization deliberately did not take any action to respond to the protest.
“GIA made a conscious decision not to stage a counter-protest on Tuesday because we are a proactive, not reactive, organization,” Goldstein said.
However, Goldstein disagreed with the aims of the protest and characterized it as divisive.
“I think the protest was short-sighted. It framed a complex conflict in black-and-white terms in which only Israel is at fault, which is neither a fair nor constructive assessment,” Goldstein said. “Not to mention the fact that boycotting a business just because it’s Israeli gets us nowhere closer to peace, mutual understanding or a two-state solution — it merely divides and antagonizes.”
Sarah Mink said that the demonstration was protesting against actions of the Israeli army and did not denounce the entire country or population.
“This isn’t anti-Israel, anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish. That’s a really common misconception that people have,” Mink said. “As a Jew, I’m really uncomfortable with Israel’s actions against human rights violations in Palestinian territories.”
GIA board member Josh Goldberg (COL ’17) also was uncomfortable with the protest, asking for students to support peaceful solutions instead.
“Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle East and therefore is an important strategic ally to the United States. Students should be aware of the current situation in the Middle East and do what they can to support a peaceful resolution,” Goldberg said.
Though Mink acknowledged the importance of peace talks, she noted that such solutions had failed in the past, requiring actions such as the protest.
“We’re of the mindset that all of the peace talks and negotiations don’t really work in diplomacy. Although we really believe in it, it is not necessarily what is going to bring about peace and end human rights violations,” Mink said.
Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine could not be reached for comment by press time.
The Sabra Hummus House will be open through Oct. 26.

While Muslims in Syria kill women, children, elderly indiscriminately – up to 250,000 people and counting – we devote our anger on Israel for we are anti-Semites in sheep’s clothing.
While Muslims have killed up to one million in Sudan, and counting, we devote our anger on Israel for we are really just anti-Semites pretending we are humanitarians.
While Muslims in Mali have forced 500,000 (and counting) people into refugee status – as they have done in the past year – we devote our anger on Israel for we are anti-Semites pretending to be for social justice.
While Muslims kill off what remains of the ancient Hindu population in-and-around Pakistan we devote our anger on Israel for we are like the Germans during the 1930s – people who needed a convenient scapegoat to escape their own feelings of frustration.
While Muslims have wiped out all the Buddhists from their ancient homeland in Afghanistan we devote our anger on Israel for it’s easy to pick on Jews and we are shameless hypocrites engaging in man’s oldest prejudice, anti-Semitism, while pretending to be holier-than-thou.

In order to clarify my concerns, let’s take a look back in history to 1933 when Hitler rose to power and became Chancellor of Germany and the Nazis won a large number of seats in the German parliament. What followed was the notorious nationwide Nazi boycott targeting Jewish businesses and professionals directed by Nazi storm-troopers posting signs everywhere saying “Do not buy from Jews!” Widespread anti-Semitism mounted with the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 depriving Jews of their basic rights as citizens and banning them from all professional jobs in education, politics, academia and industry which escalated in severity ultimately concluding in the “Final Solution.”

“Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip”. The Hoya really needs to be more careful in fact checking, especially when dealing with such a sensitive issue.

Ruth Gavison, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a founding member of the Israel Association for Civil Rights, spoke about the Jewishness of Israel and its implications Wednesday in Copley Formal Lounge.
The event, sponsored by the Program for Jewish Civilization and School of Foreign Service, is the seventh PJC event of the semester.
In this lecture, Gavison focused on what Israel’s Jewish tradition means to both the Arab and Jewish citizens in Israel, as well as to Jews throughout the world.
Gavison offered a brief account of history in order to give a base for her argument. In 1947 the United Nations General Assembly made a resolution that the British Mandate for Palestine would be separated into two states, an Arab one and a Jewish one, and that each must make a commitment to respect the rights of the other group living in their territory. However, this resolution was not a conclusive solution to the tensions of the Jewish and Palestinian conflict.
“What was obvious in 1947, ’48, ’49 is not so obvious at all anymore and this is the challenge of the time and why I have to come here and talk to you about what is the meaning of the Jewishness of the state, what is the justification for that, is it okay for there to be a Jewish state and what are the implications of this identity,” Gavison said.
According to Gavison, Jews living within Israel and abroad have a political and ideological internal debate over the Jewishness of Israel.
“Among Jews in Israel there is a general acceptance that Israel is and should be a Jewish state, but there is a debate on the implication and meaning of the Jewishness of the state,” Gavison said. “Some people say the state must be governed by Jewish law. Others say most of the Jews in Israel are not religious and not observant and the Jewishness of Israel is about the right of Jews … and this is not about religion.”
Gavison spoke about the definition of the Jewishness of a state and its nuances.
“It is an ongoing conversation and the meaning of the Jewishness of the State is that the State is in part designed to allow Jews to continue to have this discussion and conversation on an ongoing basis,” Gavison said. “[It is not] to decide it once and for all, but to have the conversation within a political community, which has a territorial base on their ancient homeland in the only place in the world in which they were politically independent and the majority.”
Aditya Pande (SFS ’18) attended the lecture and was pleased that Gavison was able to make clear the core of the problem of the Jewishness of Israel.
“[There are] two states for two people, a Jewish majority state and a Palestinian majority state,” Pande said. “The only obstacle here is what is the Israeli proposal for right of return is, because if they let the Palestinians back into Israel that reduces the Jewish majority which they don’t want so that’s the solution.”
Pande said that he enjoyed the clarity of the speech.
“It was very clear,” Pande said. “She distilled her argument to one very simple point and that is that Israel should have a Jewish majority and should have self-determination. That’s why they were created. That’s why they exist.”
Also in attendance was Jonathan Morrow (COL ’18), who had attended previous lectures sponsored by PJC and was impressed with Gavison’s approach to the topic.
“It’s not just about external diplomacy. It’s not just about high level political discussions. It’s very much a grass roots discussion of what Jewishness means and what a Jewish society and government looks like,” Morrow said.

Edward Walker, the former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and Startup Angels CEO Leslie Jump spoke on Tuesday in the Healey Family Student Center about the current state of affairs in the Middle East and whether high-growth, technological entrepreneurship can succeed in areas where diplomacy has failed.
Walker began by discussing American foreign policy during George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s administrations.
“When Obama was elected president, a lot of us wondered, in terms of foreign policy, where the United States was going to go and how we might pull ourselves out of a deep hole that we had gotten ourselves into over the past eight years,” Walker said. “I don’t want to be one sided, but we can’t deny the fact that the international community did not approve American foreign policies during the Bush administration, particularly regarding to Iraq.”
However, Walker said he does not believe that there has been a fundamental change in U.S. foreign policy since Bush’s presidency.
“Regarding the question of how we can defeat terrorism, much of our foreign policy has been based upon our military policy,” Walker said. “When you have that kind of continuity, your policies cannot change that much. The question is whether we are missing the point, that in fact there are no military answers. We are dealing with beliefs, misinterpretations of religious texts and the feeling of injustice that prevails. This is what our policy should focus on.”
Walker also said he believes that we are now living in a time of change that requires new strategies.
“We can’t use the same ideas, technology and techniques of diplomacy that we used to, because everything has changed so profoundly,” Walker said. “Many people feel that the Arab Spring was unsuccessful, in some ways it was. But in reality, it changed some very important things. One thing it changed was the belief that we can make a change. Until that time, people were resigned, but now people feel that they can make this change, and that changes the entire equation.”
Jump spoke about how her interest in the Middle East was sparked.
“What was most extraordinary to me about this was how these people were deeply disturbed by what had happened and how they were misunderstood,” Jump said. “The people here did not understand the potential for what was going on in that part of the world. That’s what I decided to do with the rest of my life, help the people in the Middle East realize the potential that they have, through entrepreneurial opportunities, specifically through technology entrepreneurship.”
Jump then discussed how Startup Angels, a program that educates entrepreneurs about investment, was created and developed to best aid entrepreneurs in the Middle East.
“We have been working specifically with how to help more people become angel investors, investors in these startup companies,” Jump said. “Also, how to help more people who are already active angel investors to invest in new markets.”
Jump then shared her vision of current Middle Eastern youth and said she has high hopes for their entrepreneurial future.
“When I look at the Middle East, I see a young entrepreneurial and unstoppable group of people,” Jump said. “That is why this is so interesting, as people tend to have a different view here in the west. But I think that more people are now starting to look at them with the same optimism.”
Andrew Jacobsberg (SFS ’15), who attended the event, said that he appreciated the participation of both speakers.
“I thought it was very interesting how this event brought together two different perspectives, which usually do not cross each other,” Jacobsberg said. “The discussion featured a perspective of the private sector, through Leslie Jump’s participation, and of the public sector, with Ambassador Walker’s words. I thought that the way both perspectives intertwined was extremely interesting and made me see the Middle East with different eyes.”

Fr. James Martin, S.J., a New York Times bestselling author and editor of America magazine, spoke Wednesday evening in the Intercultural Center auditorium about encountering and forming a relationship with Jesus, which is the topic of his latest book, “Jesus: A Pilgrimage.”
During the event, attended by around 300 people, Martin drew on his life experiences to illustrate the importance of forming a personal relationship with Jesus and seeing Christ’s life through a variety of perspectives. He interspersed his commentary with jokes, utilizing the same sense of humor he has become famous for as the chaplain to “The Colbert Report.”
Martin focused a large part of his talk on the importance of approaching Jesus both through the lens of history and the lens of faith. Both mindsets offer different revelations about Jesus and his teachings, according to Martin.
“To fully meet Jesus Christ, the believer needs both to understand the Jesus of history, the man who walked the earth, and to encounter the Christ of faith, the one who rose from the dead,” Martin said.
Martin also talked about how important it is to acknowledge that Jesus was just as much a human being as he was a divine being. Seeing both sides of Jesus’ personhood is often a struggle, Martin said.
“If Jesus’ humanity is a stumbling block for a lot of people, his divinity is even more so. For a rational, modern mind, talk of the supernatural can be very disturbing, an embarrassment even,” Martin said.
Before opening up the floor to questions, Martin closed his talk by acknowledging the difficulty there is in coming to a complete understanding of Jesus’ identity. He said that in spite of this challenge, the journey to know Jesus is one worth embarking on.
“While Jesus’ identity as the fully human, fully divine son of God remains a mystery, it is a beautiful mystery, the most beautiful one I know and one that is well worth pondering,” Martin said.
During the question-and-answer portion of the event, Martin responded to more than half a dozen audience questions ranging from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to his presence on social media to how best to personally encounter Jesus.
Developing a one-on-one relationship with Jesus was a major theme throughout Martin’s responses to questions. He said that the closer we grow to Christ, the more we come to understand about his teachings and the more we learn about ourselves. Martin recognized, however, that often the call to grow closer to God can be met with resistance from society.
“I think when people hear the words ‘personal relationship with Jesus’ they freak out,” Martin said. “They think you’re hearing voices. So what do you do? … Just tell them your experience.”
After the talk, attendees participated in a book signing with Martin, whose book was available for purchase outside the auditorium.
Washington, D.C., resident Becky Moylan has been a long-time fan of Martin and attended the talk to hear him speak in person.
“It was really impactful to take some time away and to really think about what Jesus’ message is and how that influences each of us today,” Moylan said.
Kevin Sullivan (SFS ’14) said he attended the talk to hear Martin talk about his book and share his personal encounters with faith.
“I really learned just from the way he [Martin] speaks to others,” Sullivan said. “I really enjoyed hearing his tone in the way he delivers a message that is familiar to some, foreign to others. But the way he did it is just really personable, really relatable, especially to people our generation, our age.”

Professor Avraham Sela, a senior research fellow at the Harry S. Truman Institute and the A. Ephraim and Shirley Diamond Professor of International Relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, gave a lecture about Arab citizens of Israel on Monday. The event, sponsored by the Program for Jewish Civilization and the government department, is the 10th in a lecture series held by the PJC this year.
Sela began his presentation by referencing the events of this past weekend, in which the Israeli police shot and killed a young unarmed Arab man, resulting in riots that spread throughout the country. Sela clarified who he meant when he spoke of the Israeli Arab citizens for the purposes of his presentation.
“They are actually those who remained at the end of the 1948 war from the Palestinian Arab population who originally lived within the territory that later became the state of Israel,” Sela said.
At the end of 1948 there were only 156,000 Arabs in Israel, and today that number has grown to 1.4 million, about eighteen to twenty percent of the Israeli population. About eighty percent of Arabs in Israel are Muslim, ten percent are Christian and the rest are various small denominations.
The biggest problem that Arab citizens of Israel face is the ongoing discrimination many spheres of life, according to Sela
“We are talking about a small minority that has been underrepresented in Israel’s institutions, in Israel’s economy,” Sela said. “ A minority whose lives have been constantly and continually encroached upon not only by ongoing coincidences but according to the Israeli law. Israeli NGO and Arab NGO civil rights groups found that at least fifty Israeli laws directly or indirectly discriminate against Arabs, not necessarily because they are Arabs, but because they are non-Jews.”
Sela said that during the 1950s, the Israeli state failed to treat Arab citizens equally.
“The Israeli state and society, during this period, has treated the Israeli Arabs more like a security risk than as equal citizens of the state of Israel,” Sela said. “We can see it in a number of cases that happened from 1956 on, of how Israeli military forces or the police used light ammunition in response to demonstrations or riots.”
Sela referenced the Day of the Land in 1976 when a confrontation between Israeli forces and Israeli Arabs, who demonstrated against the confiscation of land, resulted in 6 deaths.
“The Day of the Land became a milestone in Israeli Arab history that is commemorated every year as a symbol of the steadfastness of the Israeli Arabs towards the Israeli attempts to Judaize the country as a whole,” Sela said.
Sela said that the Israeli Parliament has recently harmed the Arab population with new and unassuming legislation.
“The last five years in particular were heavily loaded or saturated with legislation initiatives of the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, that from the outside may seem quite innocent but in fact they are almost all targeting the Israeli Arabs in order to further marginalize them, in order to push them out from the Israeli representative institutions” Sela said.
According to Sela, Arabs in the government system find it difficult to succeed in creating legislation and sharing ideas.
“The Arabs in Israel are not the representatives and they don’t have the capability of changing laws or even submitting significant bills to the Knesset, because they are not really taken as part of the social and political texture,” Sela said.
According to Sela, the responsibility of repairing tensions lies on the shoulder of Jewish-Israeli citizens.
“It’s the Jewish majority that makes the laws, it’s the Jewish majority that represents the state more than anybody else,” Sela said. “The Arabs in most cases are respondents to policies. And Israeli governments have not done much in order to alleviate the situation of continued discrimination.”

Ah, there we go.
It was just a matter of time before Georgetown began ramping up their anti-Israel propaganda again…as a mouthpiece for the al-Thanis.

Students from Birzeit University in the West Bank spoke about violations of the right to education under Israeli occupation in an event sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday.
The students visited Georgetown as a stop on their U.S. Right to Education Tour, a two week trip to U.S. college campuses during which they have discussed their experiences as students in the West Bank.
The students emphasized that the conflict between Israel and Palestine affected them due to Israeli occupation.
“It’s not the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it’s the occupation. They are occupying us, our lands,” Hala Khalil, one of the students on the tour, said.
Ahmad Shwieki, another Birzeit student, said that one major violation of the right to education comes as a result of roadblocks that make it difficult for students to travel to school.
“Israel’s consistent policy is building road blocks, checkpoints, which are almost 600 by the U.N. stats,” Shwieki said. “So this consistent cutting of Palestine areas also affect Palestine students’ ability to get mobility and to reach their schools and universities.”
According to Shwieki, roadblocks restrict the schools that students can attend, and often make it difficult for particularly promising students to attend the best schools. He also claimed that the long travel times that result from the roadblocks impact students’ ability to spend a full day at school.
“Parents should be allowed to decide what school their kids go to, until the age of 15, by the international law,” Shwieki said. “We see that Palestinians don’t get to choose their school. They only find it possible to go to the nearby school because they cannot go to further schools.”
The speakers also discussed how the Israeli army’s break-ins at the university impact their quality of life.
“Occupation violates Birzeit University by breaking into the university,” Khalil said. “By breaking in, they made the campus empty by 2. Students go home at 2. The campus closes at 4. So we can’t stay on campus after 4. The library closes at 4 o’clock too so we can’t have a social life, we can’t see our friends after 4.”
Shwieki added that Israeli censorship of books permitted in Palestinian schools harms his education.
“We see that Israel controls the kind of books that get in Palestine,” Shwieki said. “Israel does not allow any book from Lebanon, does not allow any book from Syria, almost does not allow any philosophy books in Palestine.As a person who’s interested in philosophy, I rarely find books in Palestine that talk about philosophy.”
After giving their first hand accounts of experience, the students asked the audience to assist in boycotting Israel.
“Just know that supporting the oppressors is kind of being an oppressor with them,” Shwieki said.
Students for Justice in Palestine Treasurer Matt Martin (COL ’16) noted the large discrepancy between life as a Georgetown student and one at Birzeit.
“Beyond their front gates of their school are checkpoints and armored trucks. Beyond our front gates here is Washington, D.C. and everything it stands for,” Martin said.
Attendee Kathleen Bouzis (GRD ’15) felt that the right to education should be seen as a universal necessity.
“I think just the right to education is universal, no matter what your citizenship is and that no matter what the political situation is, people should have the right to be educated,” Bouzis said.

The University of California, Los Angeles’ undergraduate student government voted Tuesday night to pass a resolution calling the university to divest from American companies profiting from human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to the Daily Bruin, prompting mixed reactions from Georgetown student groups.
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), a member of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, voiced his disappointment with the results of UCLA’s divestment resolution.
“I was very saddened and frustrated to hear the news of what happened at UCLA. I think it’s far outside the scope of any student government jurisdiction to work on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Goldstein said.
Mathieu Wiener (MSB ’16) decided to form a chapter of the national organization Students Supporting Israel at Georgetown on Nov. 22, partly in response to the UCLA resolution, expressing his disappointment as well.
“Speaking on behalf of SSI, as an organization that stands for pluralism and justice and public discourse, we are appalled and disgusted by the resolution that passed. The resolution only adds fuel to the fire because it demonizes and de-legitimizes the world’s sole Jewish state and alienates Israeli moderates who support peace with the Palestinians,” Wiener said.
Matt Martin (COL ’16), a member of Students for Justice in Palestine, however, expressed his support for UCLA’s decision and for the student government’s initiative.
“What’s great about UCLA’s student government voting to pressure the university to divest, is that it’s an example of students internalizing the responsibility we all have to hold groups contributing to human rights violations accountable,” Martin wrote in an email.
UCLA has now joined the six other universities to pass similar divestment resolutions, including University of California campuses at Santa Cruz, Irvine, San Diego, Riverside and Berkeley.
“It is the University of California, Los Angeles’ duty to uphold the True Bruin values of integrity, excellence, accountability and ethicality, respect for the rights and dignity of others, and promote public service that makes a positive impact in our global community, which includes the promotion of human rights, equality, and dignity for all people without distinction,” the resolution reads.
The resolution condemned companies said to violate human rights in Palestine, such as Hewlett-Packard Company for supplying Israeli military checkpoints with biometric identification which “restricted the freedom of movement of Palestinians,” General Electric for building engines for helicopters which are “systematically used in attacks on Palestinian civilians,” Caterpillar for “continually providing engineering tools and bulldozers routinely used in the demolition of Palestinian homes, as well as Cement Roadstone Holdings and Cemex for providing building materials toward means used to violate human rights.
Martin praised the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Campaign for calling for an end to these supposed human rights violations.
“The Boycott, Divestment, Sanction Campaign, is a direct call from the Palestinian Civil Society to pressure Israel to comply with international law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Martin wrote in an email.
Goldstein noted that although other countries have seen violence, Israel seems to be unfairly targeted in the media.
“And understandably, that makes Jewish and Israeli students feel they’re targeted, when their country is the only one in the world that’s attacked by groups, like the media,” he said.
He criticized the UCLA student government’s decision as divisive and unproductive.
“I think there are many legitimate views on how to best solve the [Israeli-Palestinian] conflict, but boycotting companies just because they’re Israeli is not one of them. It just serves to divide and destruct,” Goldstein said.
Chloe Lazarus (COL ’16), a member of GU Fossil Free, a group that urges Georgetown to divest from fossil fuel companies, said that GU Fossil Free supports divestment from companies who violate human rights.
“As a fellow social justice campaign seeking to combat the injustices associated with fossil fuel companies, GU Fossil Free supports the tactic of divesting from companies that profit at the expense of human welfare. It is clear that human rights violations are taking place and we support divestment as a means of placing pressures on amoral corporate actors as well as a way to draw public attention to overlooked instances of injustice,” Lazarus wrote in an email.
Also a member of GU Fossil Free, Goldstein said that the goals of the two groups, although both pushing for divestment, are fundamentally different in nature.
“Fossil flow divestment is a zero-sum situation, but the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is far from zero-sum,” Goldstein said.
In 2010, the Georgetown Solidarity Committee and Students for Justice in Palestine formed Georgetown, Divest!, a coalition of students calling for the university to divest from companies that are said to profit from human rights violations in Israel and Palestine.
LaMarr Billups, the Assistant Vice President for Business Policy and Planning at the time, rejected Georgetown, Divest!’s call for reform.
“At that meeting you asked if Georgetown University would divest from managed funds that own stocks in certain companies that do business with Israel. The answer to that question is no,” Billups wrote in April 2010.
Georgetown, Divest! has since been dissolved.
Georgetown University gained notoriety this fall for becoming the most-represented university in the American Studies Association’s boycott of Israeli institutions, with 13 Georgetown professors signing the boycott petition.
Part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, a global campaign aiming to end Israeli occupation and colonization of Palestinian land, establish equal rights for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel and permit the return of Palestinian refugees, the boycott petition called for signatories to not publish in Israeli academic journals, teach at Israeli institutions, attend any conferences at Israeli universities or collaborate on projects with Israeli universities.
President John J. DeGioia denounced an earlier American Studies Association boycott in a statement issued in December 2013.
“The recent resolution of the American Studies Association endorsing a boycott of Israeli universities undermines the academic freedom that is essential to the mission of the Academy,” DeGioia said in a statement. “As an academic institution, it is Georgetown’s responsibility to deepen engagement and foster dialogue between scholars and societies to enhance the entire global academic community.”
More recently, pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside the Sabra Hummus House pop-up shop on Wisconsin Avenue to protest the company owners’ support of the Golani brigade of the Israeli army last month.
The U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation organized the demonstration to protest Sabra’s relationship with the Strauss Group, an Israeli food company that has served the Golani Brigade of the Israeli army, which co-owns the hummus company.

A Georgetown University Law Center student filed a lawsuit against Georgetown University on Tuesday, in response to the university’s employment of Rabbi Barry Freundel, who was arrested for voyeurism on Oct. 14.
Freundel, who faces six charges of voyeurism for recording devices in women’s private baths at the Kesher Israel Orthodox synagogue in Georgetown, is accused by the suit of luring the unnamed third-year law student to the bath. The suit names the rabbi, the synagogue and Georgetown University as defendants, charging Georgetown with improperly vetting the rabbi before hiring him.
Director of Media Relations Rachel Pugh declined to comment on the litigation but expressed the university’s horror at the allegations against Freundel and its willingness to respond to the situation.
“We are horrified by the behavior reported to have taken place at the mikvah,” Pugh wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The university is cooperating fully with law enforcement activities, as well as conducting our own investigation of Rabbi Freundel’s conduct.”
Freundel had served as an adjunct professor at the law center, teaching a course on Jewish law since the early 1990s. He last co-taught a seminar in the spring of 2014.
The lawsuit alleges that Georgetown “undertook no investigation into Freundel’s background prior to hiring him,” and aims to implicate the university in “willful blindness.” Steven Silverman, the attorney who filed the suit, could not be reached for comment.
In addition to the lawsuit, Freundel faces six criminal charges of voyeurism to which he pled not guilty in October. Freundel will face a D.C. Superior Court hearing Jan. 16.

Professor Alan Confino discussed his book “A World Without Jews: The Nazi Imagination from Persecution to Genocide” and provided insight on the psychological basis of the Nazi consciousness Wednesday afternoon in the Mortara Center. The event, sponsored by sponsored by the Program for Jewish Civilization, featured Confino, who teaches at the University of Virginia and Ben-Gurion University in Israel, and discussed how the Nazis were motivated more by religious than racial motivations.
The Rev. Dennis McManus, S.J., a faculty member in the Program for Jewish Civilization, introduced Confino. McManus said that Confino’s work explores a different angle on the Holocaust than have numerous past studies, an angle that is crucial in order to completely understand the Nazi worldview.
“Something is missing from these studies, something that helps us understand the deepest levels of the Nazi mind and where the devastating image of the Jew comes from, how it is nourished and developed into the cultivation of hate towards Jews,” McManus said. “Perhaps it is within the bounds of social psychology that Professor Confino has opened up a great new door for us to understand.”
Confino began by mentioning the historical episodes of Nazis burning the Hebrew Bible in the front of German synagogues. “Recent accounts of the Third Reich do not address why the Nazis burned the Hebrew Bible,” Confino said. “This is because they regard racial ideology as the fundamental source of the motivation and the beliefs that led to the Holocaust. In burning the Bible, the Nazis directed their wrath against the religious and not racial symbol.”
In his book Confino questions what Nazis told themselves in order to legitimize the persecution and extermination of Jews. “When you are killing someone or a lot of someones you need a good story to go along with it,” Confino said. “No one likes to admit themselves to be the bad guy who is killing all these people for no reason. Most of us, even when we do bad things, we try to find a good reason to explain ourselves.”
Confino also discussed how the relationship between space and time in putting together the full spectrum of events in the Holocaust. “The category of space has become really important because scholars have become very aware, through colonial studies, that the Nazis built an empire in Europe,” Confino said. “The Nazi empire was a vast organization, especially towards the East. The Nazis wanted to colonize the East and use the people as slaves and use the resources of the land. This assessment has been very important, but there is something very important missing from the picture, which is the element of time.”
Confino then emphasized how his work distinguishes itself from other pieces on the history of the Holocaust. “I reject the dominant interpretation of racial ideology as the main motivation of the Nazis,” Confino said. “The Nazi imagination towards the Jews was more complex and it includes many other ideas.”
At the end of his presentation, Confino addressed how the Nazis read into the past in order to construct their dangerous narrative. He said that the Nazis picked and chose symbolic stories from the history of Jewish, Germanic and Christian relations that redefined understanding of national origins.
“Nazis built their identity, using present day ideas, mixing and matching, creating stories about themselves, based on facts, inventions and imagination,” Confino said.” Telling stories makes us feel human, but not all stories are humane. Stories give life and stories kill as well.”
Giulia Martins (SFS’18) attended the event and said she appreciated the ideas Confino presented.
“It is always refreshing to be exposed to ideas which differ to what we regularly see in history textbooks,” Martins said. “Professor Confino’s work is groundbreaking in the sense that it looks at the Holocaust through a completely different lens, one which assesses different factors which many other historians might have overlooked. I found his perspective to be fascinating”

Rabbi Dr. Abraham Skorka, who co-wrote “Sobre el Cielo y la Tierra” (On Heaven and Earth) with Pope Francis, spoke about Jewish-Catholic relations as well as the need for limits on freedom of speech regarding religion in a discussion. The event was organized by the Office of the President, the Embassy of Argentina and Masorti Olami (also known as The World Council of Conservative/Masorti Synagogues) in Riggs Library Tuesday afternoon.
Skorka accompanied the pontiff as part of the papal entourage in the Middle East in May 2014. Since then the two have been working closely together in an attempt to develop meaningful dialogue between Jews and Catholics.
For Skorka, “real dialogue” involves active planning and commitment to future events as opposed to talk for the sake of talk.
“We approach each other knowing that both of us are very, very committed with the idea of real dialogue, not just tea and sympathy, but the real dialogue,” Skorka said.
Skorka then turned his focus to the role of the Catholic Church under Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. Skorka said that that some critics say that the Pope had the opportunity to save Jews, but his silence instead permitted the death of more Jews.
Skorka also discussed the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the connection between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, largely due to the role of the media. For Skorka, the media have distorted the meaning of the word Zionism.
“As all of you know, the word Zionism was transformed by the media into a bad word, a bad term. And the image of the Jews in the Diaspora was distorted by the misuse and misinterpretation of the word Zionism,” Skorka said.
Program for Jewish Civilization Director Jacques Berlinerblau moderated the discussion, and said he recognized this shift from anti-Zionism into anti-Semitism.
“I see an equation that we are very familiar with in Washington that anti-Zionism degrades easily into anti-Semitism,” Berlinerblau said.
This shift towards anti-Semitism has had lethal effects, most recently with the recent terrorist attack in Paris, which targeted Jews.
“Nowadays Zionism is a kind of anti-Semitism. Think about what occurred in Paris,” Skorka said.“Okay, the conflict is in the Middle East, it is between Israel and Palestine. Why did they attack a kosher supermarket? They didn’t know exactly if the clients in the supermarket are more Zionist, against the idea of a Jewish state in Israel — they knew nothing. … The only thing they knew is ‘We must attack Jews.’ And the ideology of them is anti-Zionist.”
The question of freedom of speech that has arisen in the context of the Charlie Hebdo attack brought up a debate about the depth of media criticism. Skorka said that today’s media and public fail to evaluate information as critically and deeply as those living a generation ago. Historically, Jewish intellectuals have been strong supporters of freedom of speech.
“Here in the United States, freedom of speech has traditionally been a Jewish issue,” Berlinerblau said. “Some of the greatest defenders of the right of American freedom of speech, especially in the 1960s, were Jewish intellectuals.”
However, Skorka said he supports limited freedom of speech in cases where the speech is meant only to degrade others. Skorka said that this type of speech is only an abuse of the freedom.
Trixia Apiado (SFS ’18), who attended the event, applauded the common ground that Pope Francis and Jewish leaders have been able to reach in their dialogue.
“I’m from the Philippines and I followed Pope Francis’ visit in the Philippines this past week, so it’s nice to see another religious denomination speaking about the same thing,” Apiado said. “It’s just [about] helping the poorest no matter what their identities are and no matter what their religions are.”

The Georgetown Israel Alliance presented endorsement criteria to the Georgetown University Student Association executive candidates over the past few weeks, including language that advocated for Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish democratic state and the opposition of any Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions resolution at Georgetown.
Although all candidates eventually refused to sign an agreement, Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16) and Reno Varghese (SFS ’16) agreed to revised criteria supporting free and open discussion, a decision which received GIA’s endorsement yesterday.
At midnight today, Rosenberger and Varghese, Chris Wadibia (COL ’16) and Meredith Cheney (COL ’16), and Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Connor Rohan (COL ’16) signed a different petition written by Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16), co-founder and former co-president of J Street U Georgetown, which encourages campus-wide debate and discussion.
The BDS movement, which advocates for the boycott of and divestment from Israeli businesses internationally, as well as the sanctioning of the Israeli government for alleged human rights violations against Palestinians, serves as a major point of contention between Israeli and Palestinian advocacy groups on college campuses nationwide, including at Georgetown.
GIA’s initial endorsement criteria, reformulated in January, asked candidates to agree to oppose any BDS resolution.
“We affirm our support for students and student groups that advocate for Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state,” the endorsement criteria read. “We will firmly oppose any Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) resolution at Georgetown University, standing instead for positive campus dialogue that brings different Georgetown communities together around a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”
GIA Marketing and External Secretary Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) and GIA President Harper Weissburg emphasized the need to make certain student groups on campus feel intellectually and emotionally safe and secure as justification for including BDS language in the original criteria.
“We need to keep in mind those students whose intellectual and emotional security are jeopardized every time an inflammatory, degrading and anti-Israel symbol, comment or activity comes to campus,” Weissburg said.
Weissburg also emphasized when speaking to GUSA candidates that it is every student’s right to talk about BDS on campus and that it is the obligation of GUSA to always allow the conversation to occur.
“We prefaced [talks with GUSA candidates] by saying it is every students right, if they so wish, to bring BDS to campus; obviously, we are a pro-Israel organization so we don’t want it to pass, but it is every student’s right to bring it if they so wish,” Weissburg said.
Weissburg said that the GIA reached out to GUSA candidates because they want to support an open dialogue on campus. Weissburg cited Students for Justice in Palestine’s policy of anti-normalization, which prevents the group from collaborating or co-sponsoring with any campus group that support Israel.
“Thus, moving forward the possibility of co-sponsorships on an organizational level is no longer a possibility, and as a consequence of that fact, Georgetown Israel Alliance felt the only way to continue fostering a safe space for open dialogue on campus, in light of anti-normalization, was to ask for help,” Weissburg wrote in an email. “We, as GIA, can no longer ask SJP to work with us in any official capacity, therefore, we needed GUSA’s help to broker dialogue moving forward because we are no longer in a position to do so.”
The revised statement, agreed to by Rosenberger and Varghese, encourages campus dialogue and a push toward ending conflict but does not include mention of BDS.
“We affirm our support for students and student groups that advocate for Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state. We will always stand for positive campus dialogue that brings different Georgetown communities together around a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” the GIA statement signed by the Rosenberger-Varghese campaign reads.
Students for Justice in Palestine President Leila Shebaro (SFS ’15) said that BDS serves to support the rights of those in Palestine.
“The BDS call is fundamentally about supporting human rights,” Shebaro wrote in an email. “Specifically, it delineates the non-violent tactics of boycott, divestment and sanctions designed to hold governments and corporations accountable for their roles in human rights violations against Palestinians.”
However, according to the GIA, BDS movements across the country serve as hate speech, stifling the conversation of Israeli-Palestinian peace on college campuses nationwide.
“We originally chose to include language opposing a BDS resolution in the firm belief that, as hate speech, BDS has no place at Georgetown,” GIA wrote in a statement endorsing Rosenberger and Varghese. “On every campus at which a BDS resolution has been presented to student government, it has ultimately served to shut down dialogue and divide the very communities that need to come together.”
GIA presented their initial endorsement criteria to four campaigns: Sara Margolis (COL ’16) and Ryan Shymansky (COL ’16), Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) and Will Simons (COL ’16), Wadibia and Cheney, and Rosenberger and Varghese. Margolis and Shymansky, Wadibia and Cheney, and Rosenberger and Varghese agreed to the initial wording of the group’s endorsement request, citing the inclusion of preemptively opposing a BDS resolution as stifling free expression on campus, as well as overstepping GUSA’s jurisdictional boundaries. Both tickets later retracted their support, citing initial confusion and later realization of possible repercussions of signing the statement.
“We firmly believe in the rights of all students and student groups to advocate for their beliefs in a respectful manner; however, we do not believe it is appropriate for GUSA to take a stance on international issues,” Margolis and Shymansky wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Wadibia-Cheney ticket agreed and said that GUSA was not a platform for such political agreements.
“GUSA isn’t the platform to express political views and we condemn behavior of student groups on campus attempting to corner and politicize GUSA campaigns,” Wadibia and Cheney wrote in a public statement.
The McNaughton-Simons campaign, which initially discussed supporting the leadership resolution with GIA, came to an eventual decision to not support the endorsement criteria. According to Weissburg, GIA leadership approached McNaughton and Simons three weeks ago, and their campaign manager affirmed their agreement to GIA’s original petition Jan. 22. Weissburg said that last week, McNaughton and Simons spoke with her and denied ever agreeing to the statement.
“I began the conversation by thanking them for being the first to affirm our leadership statement,” Weissburg wrote in an email. “To the shock of both Ari and I, Abbey claimed she had never actually read the leadership statement, and Will  in response looked incredulous because he as well though this had become a moot point weeks ago. The Abbey/Will campaign only came out saying they had never explicitly affirmed the statement after rumors were circulating about the possibility of other campaigns pulling out as well. Regardless of their motivation, GIA firmly believes the Abbey/Will campaign was the first to affirm our statement with its original wording. In short, this was a horrible miscommunication.”
McNaughton and Simons deny that they ever reached a full consensus on the issue, although they did participate in discussions with GIA.
“Our staff was engaged in supportive conversations with GIA leadership regarding the language for the past few weeks. In our continued conversations with GIA we did not explicitly sign on to the agreement,” McNaughton and Simons wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUSA executive candidates Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Connor Rohan (COL ’16), who were not approached initially, as GIA assumed they were a joke ticket, affirmed in Wednesday’s vice presidential debate that they met with the GIA this week and decided against signing on to the leadership statement.
“As soon as we found out that the Joe and Connor ticket was a serious ticket, we went to them straight away,” Weissburg said.
“We received an email, we asked them to elaborate — we decided to go against it — then we met with them and we still decided to go against it,” Rohan said.
In a statement sent to candidates and campus media on Wednesday, Jatovsky called upon GUSA campaigns to sign a new leadership statement as a first step to reconciling differences and moving forward in confronting divisive issues. The Rosenberger-Varghese, Wadibia-Cheney and Luther-Rohan tickets signed this petition today at midnight. Margolis and Shymansky decided to remain in agreement with their original statement.
Jatovsky’s statement reads: “We affirm our support for students and student groups that advocate for what they believe is a constructive resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We will always stand for positive, safe and constructive campus conversations and activism that brings different Georgetown communities together around a peaceful and just resolution to this conflict.”
McNaughton and Simons did not sign Jatovsky’s petition, but instead released a statement stating their support of free discussion.
“In light of recent events, we would like to affirm our complete support for free expression and open dialogue regarding any issue on campus,” McNaughton and Simons wrote. “As individuals, we will always support positive, safe and constructive conversations and activism at Georgetown. Furthermore, we support constructive dialogue between all students and student groups that seek a peaceful and just solutions to current local, national and international issues.”
Jatovsky said he is pleased that all candidates, regardless of their decision to sign any petitions, have stated a desire to encourage free and open speech on campus.
“I believe all the candidates have addressed the issues I raised in my essay head on and have demonstrated leadership in building a campus environment that fosters constructive dialogue,” Jatovsky wrote in an email to The Hoya.
When the language of the GIA’s initial endorsement criteria was leaked to the Georgetown student body early this week, including their opposition of any BDS resolution, students turned to social media platforms and other facets of mass mobilization in opposition.
Nabeel Zewail (SFS ’15), Ziad Saqr (NHS ’15) and Aziz Saqr (NHS ’16) co-wrote an opinion piece on Facebook titled “GIA silences transparency on Israeli-Palestinian Issue in GUSA Campaign” and created a Facebook event encouraging students to attend Wednesday’s GUSA vice presidential debate to ask candidates about this particular issue.
According to Zewail, opposing the GIA endorsement criteria was fundamentally important as including a provision on preemptively opposing a BDS resolution suppressed free expression on campus.
“When I heard about this, we realized this is no way for Georgetown to operate in terms of restricting free speech on an important issue,” Zewail said.
Zewail also emphasized the need for GUSA executives to distance themselves from taking sides on international political issues. However, he advocated for GUSA executives to focus on how such issues are relevant to tangible Georgetown institutions.
“Our position is not that we want the GUSA executive to be involved in international political issues, but rather the very narrow issue of how Georgetown spends its endowment and whether it is consistent with our social justice mission,” Zewail said.
Goldstein and Weissburg said that including BDS dialogue in their endorsement statement did not serve the purpose they intended.
“We came to the realization in conversations with the campaigns and with community members, that despite our inclusion of BDS in the name of dialogue and free speech, it ended up alienating many students, alienating many students that we are hopeful to engage in dialogue with,” Goldstein said.
Jatovsky cited the BDS movement as extremely contentious, a movement that needs to be addressed cautiously because of its polarizing nature.
“What is viewed by many in the Jewish community as a movement that undermines dialogue and establishes insecurity is viewed by many in the Arab-American community as a legitimate — even necessary — political expression that addresses their frustration over the continued Israeli occupation of the West Bank and lack of diplomatic successes in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Jatovsky said.
Shebaro also emphasized the importance of GUSA serving as a venue where free speech can be expressed on campus without repercussion.
“We believe that it is GUSA’s responsibility to protect and encourage free speech, particularly about politically charged and sometimes confusing issues such as BDS, which often make for the most productive discussions,” Shebaro said. “Without creating a space to discuss BDS, we make it impossible for us as a community to educate ourselves and take an informed stance on the subject.”
While both students for and against the GIA’s endorsement criteria acknowledge that there is a ways to go in regards to fostering greater communication between groups on campus, Goldstein acknowledged that this conflict serves as a foundation to inspire future conversation and to improve Israeli-Palestinian dialogue at Georgetown in the future.
“I hope that the Palestinian and Arab community on campus can take our efforts over the past few days in good faith and the goals that we share of promoting dialogue and coming together on this issue,” Goldstein said. “I hope that the negative and positive experiences this week will build more of a ground for engagement and communication in the future.”
 
Correction: An original article stated that Margolis and Shymansky and Wadibia and Cheney agreed to the initial wording of the group’s endorsement request. In fact, Rosenberger and Varghese also agreed to the initial wording. All groups later retracted their support.

Mr. Goldstein hopes that other communities on campus will believe that GIA’s efforts were in good faith? Well, they probably won’t. Not when GIA wants to limit free debate on campus. Not when their argument is that they might feel  intellectually and emotionally insecure if someone takes a different stance and approach than theirs. Political debate is always contentious and usually rancorous. That’s a good thing; rigorous debate is the anvil on which policy is tested and refined. When the leaders of a political club try to exempt their pet cause from that process by pretending emotional fragility, it’s difficult to believe they are acting in good faith.

The five presidential candidates in the Georgetown University Student Association executive race participated in a heated debate Monday evening in the Healey Family Student Center.
The debate featured presidential candidates Chris Wadibia (COL ’16), Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16), Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16), Sara Margolis (COL ’16) and Joe Luther (COL ’16). GUSA Election Commissioner Pavan Rajgopal (SFS ’14) moderated the debate, which featured questions from members of campus media and the GUSA Finance and Appropriations Committee, as well as those posed through Twitter and written on paper by members of the audience.
Indicative of the divisive nature of this GUSA executive race, supporters of all campaigns flooded the venue, providing resounding applause as candidates made statements. The debate also uncharacteristically provided a venue for candidates to address issues of the character of other candidates, integrity and elitism, with broad generalizations often receiving vocal objections by the crowd. At points, Rajgopal was forced to ask the audience to stifle applause in order to maintain the continuity of the debate.
Opening Statements
The debate began with five-minute opening statements from each candidate.
Margolis, a transfer student from George Washington University, started by explaining her unconventional path to Georgetown, her experience in transfer student advocacy as GUSA’s first Secretary of Transfer Affairs and her and running mate Ryan Shymansky’s (COL ’16) passion for social justice issues and connecting with students through advocacy.
“The strength of our platform comes from acknowledging what GUSA can do on its own and on day one — what we can only achieve through collaboration and advocacy work — and what we can begin to do throughout our term to lay the groundwork for the future,” Margolis said. “I am running for GUSA because I believe every student on the Hilltop deserves an advocate.”
Luther, who initiated his opening statement by ripping up a prepared speech, explained his and running mate Connor Rohan’s (COL ’16) motivation for running for GUSA executive, the legitimacy of their candidacy and their vision for the Georgetown of the future.
""I saw GUSA as a cesspool of self-indulgence. And I thought, 'I want in.'"" – Luther #GUSA2015

“The position of GUSA executive is about informing the student body and advocating for them; in order to do that you need an administration that is committed to transparency and to mobilizing the student body about things that they care about,” Luther said.
Rosenberger opened by explaining the significance of the GUSA executive role, the importance of electing an executive that will take bold action and his passion for promoting student funding reform and bringing a voice to students who are underrepresented on campus.
“We have the solutions and we have the vision that will make this university better,” Rosenberger said. “We have a vision that should make you excited about GUSA, because we will be a GUSA that actually matters.”
McNaughton discussed her top policy concerns in her opening statement, citing funding, sexual assault and mental health reforms, as well as her and running mate Will Simons’ (COL ’16) qualifications and plan for representing all communities at Georgetown as executives.
“What matters is who’s in the room when the decisions are made; look at our platform, look at our campaign … we are about changing who’s in the room when the decisions are made,” McNaughton said. “Now more than ever, we need a strong, unified and pluralistic voice.”
Wadibia opened by explaining his experiences in the campaign so far, citing this past week as “the worst week of [his] life.” Wadibia said that he was accused of being a homophobe, that his social media posts were flagged for pornography and that he saw his campaign banner in Red Square torn down multiple times.
“I have been accused of being homophobic. … I have been accused of being pro-sexual assault, yet every individual on this campus knows that when I speak to persons — particularly women — I speak to every individual with respect,” Wadibia said.
Wadibia concluded by explaining his intentions for becoming GUSA executive, outlining his experience working with 11 administrators to create his platform and emphasizing his desire to change the attitude and reputation of the association.
“Most students look down upon the student association because the student association looks down upon them,” Wadibia said. “Unless you elect an individual that has a heart for people, GUSA will remain the same.”
Media Questions
Candidates then answered questions from campus media outlets The Georgetown Voice and The Hoya — the GUTV representative was absent — as well as from members of the GUSA Finance and Appropriations committee and from students via Twitter and paper. According to Rajgopal, Fin/App asked for a seat at the debates to delve more deeply into the candidate’s budgets.
Candidates were allocated 45 seconds to answer each question. The election commission at its discretion allowed an additional two-minute discussion period per question.
The first question referenced the recently created Designing the Future(s) initiative by University President John J. DeGioia and Provost Robert Groves, asking candidates how they see Georgetown in the future, as well as how aspects of their platforms may influence the university in the coming years.
Wadibia emphasized the importance of not regarding the administration as antagonists in order to affect meaningful change, explaining how he and Cheney’s short platform is achievable and substantive, while reaching the “hearts and minds” of students.
“We must be very careful that we don’t take the adversarial approach towards the administration,” Wadibia said.
McNaughton explained the importance of maintaining what makes Georgetown special, while citing her experience actually working on the Designing the Future(s) initiative over the past few months.
“Wherever Georgetown goes in the next 20, 25 years, we need to make sure that we are maintaining what makes Georgetown special,” McNaughton said. “That can’t happen unless we have the resources available to do it; that can’t happen unless we have a unified, strong student voice.”
Rosenberger took a pragmatic approach to the question, citing specific issues with facilities, housing requirements and study-abroad housing issues, as well as continual funding for academics and scholarships as tantamount to maintaining Georgetown’s prominence in the future.
Margolis emphasized the importance of focusing on the next campus plan, encouraging an agreement with the university to push for additional green space as well as a construction plan that mitigates impact on student life.
Luther answered by highlighting continual student input on university decision-making as incredibly important moving forward as an advocacy body, balancing student and administration goals.
“Georgetown is over 200 years old, but it is never too late for a growth spurt,” Luther said. “The administration has been single-handedly making all the decisions, when we’re the student body who actually goes to school here.”
The candidates were then asked to name a reform made by Trevor Tezel (SFS ’15) and Omika Jikaria (SFS ’15) that they would change or eliminate as GUSA executive.
McNaughton emphasized her and Simons’ desire to reform the relationship of the existing multicultural council with student organizations, citing the “multicultural” label as potentially being levied upon student organizations without choice.
Rosenberger explained a need to expand the existing “What’s a Hoya?” program, allocating more money from GUSA to it — as well as expanding the program to transfer students and allowing student groups to host events — while proposing far more liberal criteria necessary to participate.
Margolis also advocated for the reform of the multicultural council, expressing an intent to roll back the council, consult with student groups and create a multicultural advisory board.
Luther said that his southward-bound GPA during the time of Tezel and Jikaria’s administration was something he wanted to roll back but also emphasized a need to garner additional student input when making decisions and encouraging greater transparency in the GUSA executive.
Wadibia also advocated for reform of the multicultural council, citing issues of funding as well as relatability and seeing a need to reform both how and from where multicultural groups receive funding, as well as the input that goes into decisions involving multicultural groups.
Candidates were also asked how their positions as either GUSA outsiders or insiders would influence their ability to relate to the current GUSA senate in order to make policy. The GUSA Finance and Appropriations committee also questioned candidates on where additional money to facilitate “big-ticket items” in their platforms would come from.
Weaknesses
Candidates were also asked what their biggest weaknesses as GUSA executive would be.
Wadibia says weakness is lack of involvement in GUSA. Says ""fresh mind"" will ""change the nature of how GUSA operates."" #GUSA2015

Candidate-Specific Questioning
In the audience-solicited questioning period, candidates were asked questions through Twitter and paper in the format of group questioning as well as candidate-specific questions.
Candidates were asked which solutions in their platform addressed sexual assault reform on campus as well as their plans for unrecognized student groups to receive access to benefits.
In the candidate-specific questioning portion, Margolis was questioned on her and Shymansky’s Student Activities Capital Campaign, explaining that young alumni are not necessarily incentivized to donate to Georgetown. According to Margolis, the campaign would allow alumni to donate specifically to groups with which they had an affiliation during their time at Georgetown.
Margolis was asked by fellow candidates about how she would justify the Student Activities Capital Campaign to the University Office of Advancement.
Margolis says that the goal is not too lofty, other student ideas such as The Corp, GUASFCU have succeeded. #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

The commission asked Rosenberger as to the reasoning behind committing to the Georgetown Israel Alliance’s leadership endorsement criteria pledge. Rosenberger said that he carefully considered the petition and that it “absolutely falls under GUSA’s purview.”
Wadibia questioned Rosenberger on potentially siding with one side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by signing the GIA pledge.
“I have so many friends that are Jewish, and so many friends that are Muslim. … This document has no place in GUSA because it is inherently divisive,” Wadibia said. “You signed that document, you cannot sign the document without taking a stance, it is fundamentally impossible.”
Wadibia says GIA petition ""promotes one side of the argument,"" says document is ""divisive."" #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

Rosenberger countered by mentioning Wadibia’s previously panned sexual assault platform and accused Wadibia of misinformation and not fully understanding the complexity of certain issues.
“You know Chris, you signed the thing and then you reneged. You wrote the sexual assault platform that got panned, then you got hung up for it. … You don’t know what you’re talking about, it’s clear — you keep flip-flopping. … We’re not worried about sexual assault because we think you’re pro-sexual assault — we are worried because we feel unsafe,” Rosenberger said. “We wouldn’t feel safe with you as GUSA executive.”
Wadibia was questioned as to allegations of not having enough student-leader input in his platform. Wadibia responded by stating that he consulted with student leaders from many student groups, and wrote his platform together with such leaders.
“The reason that my platform is succinct and yet powerful is because every part of my platform reaches out to all students,” Wadibia stated.
Rosenberger responded by stating that he is on the board of GU Pride and that Wadibia did not attempt to garner input from the organization.
Rosenberger: ""Chris, I'm on the board of GU Pride, and you didn't talk to us."" Asks why they weren't asked to contribute to platform.
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

Wadibia explained that Rosenberger’s claims were unfounded and explained that his character is what set him apart from his fellow candidates.
“The reason each of these candidates cannot be elected is that they don’t have the character to lead,” Wadibia said.
Wadibia also questioned Luther and his ability to perform administrative duties as GUSA executive while connecting with certain communities on campus.
Luther responded by saying that a candidate cannot go into the executive race knowing everything, and that he and Rohan will advocate for “all students.”
Luther says ""95 percent of the process that goes behind comedy is hard work,"" that he will take the campaign seriously. #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

 
Wadibia responded by questioning Luther’s competency to lead, asking him to explain the difference between the Black Student Alliance and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, saying that “leadership must be rooted in experience.”
“You have a talent, Joe, that is humor. But it is sad because that is the only talent that you have,” Wadibia said.
""I'm the campus jester but that's a clown move."" – Luther to Wadibia on sexual assault platform. #GUSA2015
— The Hoya (@thehoya) February 17, 2015

McNaughton was questioned as to how her experience as a student representative to the university board of directors would prepare her to lead as GUSA executive and responded that her experience is beneficial, as she worked on issues that affected students directly, albeit admitting that there is still much work to do in regards to student-administrator dialogue.
Candidates ended the debate with 2.5-minute closing statements to end the nearly two-hour long event.
The GUSA executive election voting will commence Wednesday night. Ballot links will be sent through HoyaMail.

I thought Tim was probably the most impressive, although he’s probably not a frontrunner for the actual election. He handled himself well and brought up a lot of good points. Luther also did a great job of combining humor and real platform points, although his comments tended to be brief.
I thought it was ironic that Chris built his entire campaign around his personal character and dignity, and then proceeded to mudsling far more than any other candidate. He attacked Sara despite having cross-endorsed with her early. In addition, his questioning of Luther was amateurish and unnecessary. Not only did he look ridiculous when Luther knew the difference between the BSA and and the NAACP, but the question itself was absurd. His comments about Joe having only one talent were openly hostile, and totally betrayed the entire premise of his opening remarks about getting to know people personally. 
It’s safe to say that the GIA discussion was ridiculous, which I think Joe summarized nicely. Chris’s questioning of Tim on the topic is ludicrous considering that he signed and then reneged. Tim seemed far more educated about what the agreement entailed. 
I thought the highlight of the debate was Tim’s closing when he totally put Chris’s “worst week of my life” comments in perspective and generally poked fun at Chris’s repeated attempt to mark GUSA as elitist.

Something I thought was pretty telling about how the debate was received: each candidate besides Chris received a small amount of applause from everyone in the room after their closing statements. Chris received a raucous standing ovation from his campaign team, while no one else even thought of clapping. I guess no one else wants to support a guy who says he was personally attacked this week, then proceeds to personally attack all the other candidates.

I genuinely hope Sara Margolis doesn’t win. My few interactions with her have shown her to be rude, cold, and unapproachable. The only thing special that her ticket brings is the capital project, which will fail miserably, because this proposed project already exists. Decentralizing a fundraising center is completely useless and will do more harm than good. Unfortunately, Ms. Margolis is not familiar with the school’s current funding system. She seems to know very little about very important issues. Her familiarity with dining is sad. Most freshmen will and always will care about the dining options on campus. GET ME BETTER FOOD GUSA!!! Unfortunately, she really doesn’t know anything about dining, so you can expect her/her crew not to make any changes on that front next year. Her little dig at the GUSA Senate was very exclusivist. I mean how can she claim to not have any familiarity with a whole branch of GUSA when she claims she’s super involved with GUSA?! I feel like the exec wasted a lot of their efforts on a failed Multicultural Advisory Board (that’s all I’ve ever read about them in campus media…) and the same will happen next year with Sara’s capital  project. Aside from transfer affairs, Ms. Margolis doesn’t seem to be very informed about the core issues. I do think Chris’ elitist dig does sort of apply to the Margolis-Schmansky ticket.

NotIgnorantFreshman says 
February 17, 2015 at 5:16 pm
I suggest before making baseless claims, I would read their platform. Their meal-plan ideas are extensive. The platform covers Leo’s problems in detail and offers several solutions. In fact, it is one of the main freshman focuses of the Marmansky campaign, so your claim is utterly invalid and only shows blatant ignorance of the realities of the GUSA campaigns. This is not to say that other tickets do not support meal plan changes, but to say that Leo’s is not on their radar is just entirely wrong. For more detailed information about this, see page 23 of their platform found on their website. As for her experience in GUSA, an attack on minimal experience on the exec is applicable to almost all of the candidates. Once again, for someone who claims that Sara is uninformed about core issues should refer to a very detailed and passionate platform full of feasible and delineated ideas.

Although you’re probably working for a campaign that’s competing against Sara and Ryan, and are therefore not an impartial observer – I have to concur.  There is a frustrating, frightening misunderstanding of the issues in this GUSA Campaign.  Sara and Ryan’s funding reform looks great on paper but is impractical, Chris and Meredith are running on vague platitudes, Abbey and Will have great individual ideas but no big signature one that they’ve pushed, and Tim and Reno are lagging so far behind in support that they’re resorting to reverse hit jobs in arcane internet publications.  Finally, you’ve got similarly good ideas from the Luther-Rohan camp, but no big headliners.  At least they’re entertaining though.
The entertaining part here is that this one is shaping up to be a 3 1/2 to 4 horse race – Abbey/Will, Sara/Ryan, Luther/Rohan, and Chris/Meredith if the fireworks at last night’s debate don’t hurt them too much.  Here’s hoping for a barn burner.

The award for the most hyperbolic comment of the night must go to Rosenberger:  
“We’re not worried about sexual assault because we think you’re pro-sexual assault — we are worried because we feel unsafe,” Rosenberger said. “We wouldn’t feel safe with you as GUSA executive.”
Seriously, dude?  If you are so unmanly that the you feel “”unsafe” on campus and need to verbalize that you wouldn’t feel safe with Chris as president, then you’re not strong enough to lead the students of Georgetown and perhaps you should get some counseling.  Wow.  And I say that as a Luther-Rohan supporter.  To be fair, Chris showed himself not worthy of the presidency either with his whiny performance, his attacks, and his race-baiting with the BSA/NAACP question. 
The sad thing about McNaughton is she revealed her feminists alliances and proved how the group that yells the loudest get the most attention by citing as her top policy concerns as sexual assault and mental health issues, both of which affect a small subset of students (spare me the “sexual assault is everyone’s problem” line . . . so is poverty, racism, and every other social ill . . . we live in a world with limited time and resources and GUSA has very limited power, so the time, attention, and influence of the GUSA executive can be better used elsewhere).  Bottom line, if you’re a man, you shouldn’t be voting for McNaughton.
Margolis came off sounding the best b/c of the student funds allocation thing, but GUSA is a joke so don’t vote for her, though if Luther-Rohan weren’t running she would be the best.
VOTE LUTHER-ROHAN!

McNaughton Supporter says 
February 18, 2015 at 6:14 pm
I think it’s unfair to label McNaughton as a feminist that caters to “groups that yell the loudest”. I think it’s refreshing to see a GUSA representative (specifically a Republican) that wants to place some emphasis on creating a safer and happier campus. That obviously won’t be her sole purpose–they have a pretty extensive platform that you may want to look into.

Over the past two weeks, various student groups and individuals have pledged their support to one of the five campaigns in the Georgetown University Student Association executive election.
This year, fourteen clubs endorsed particular candidates, while the majority of endorsements came from individuals. Last year, nine student groups endorsed, and in the 2013 election, 15 groups did so. For the past two years, the current GUSA president and vice presidents declined to endorse any ticket.
Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Connor Rohan (COL ’16) have picked up endorsements from the editorial boards of The Hoya, The Georgetown Voice, The Georgetown Heckler and the Georgetown Improv Association. Luther and Rohan are the editor-in-chief and managing editor, respectively, of The Georgetown Heckler and both are members of the Improv Association.
“Do not take their seemingly facetious platform lightly,” The Hoya editorial board wrote. “Behind the humor lies a thoughtful agenda committed to mental health reform, transparency and student-community engagement.”
Sara Margolis (COL ’16) and Ryan Shymansky (COL ’16) received a lengthy list of personal endorsements that included GUSA senators, the Secretary of the Arts Caleb Lewis (COL ’16), ANC Commissioners Reed Howard (SFS ’17) and Kendyl Clausen (SFS ’16), and J Street U Co-President Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16).
Another one of their endorsers is Nora West (SFS ’15), GUSA secretary of health and student safety.
“In my role with GUSA and as a sexual assault peer educator I have worked a great deal with survivors and sexual assault education programs,” West said. “Reading Sara and Ryan’s platform and seeing their commitment to proactive risk reduction and reactive survivor support showed me that they understood the issue and were committed to changing the campus climate.”
Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) and Will Simons (COL ’16) have garnered 85 individual endorsements as well, including a large number of GUSA senators and committee chairs, four club sports teams, President of the Black Pre-Law Association Queen Adesuyi (COL ’16) President of College Democrats, Matt Gregory (SFS ’17) and President of College Republicans, Amber Athey (COL ’16). They also received eight endorsements from student groups, the most of any candidate. Groups include Club Hockey, Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and H*yas for Choice. McNaughton and Simons also received an “A” grade from H*yas for Choice in their sexual health questionnaire, the highest of any campaign.
One of their other supporters is Megan Murday (SFS ’15), a GUSA deputy chief of staff and president of the School of Foreign Service Academic Council.
“I spent much of this year engaging in master planning discussions and lobbying for student priorities,” Murday said. “Abbey and Will are the only ticket that have both the background knowledge necessary to seamlessly continue advocating for student interests and the ability to build the administrative relationships necessary to earn respect and be taken seriously.”
Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16) and Reno Varghese (SFS ’16) received endorsements from both GUPride, of which Rosenberger is secretary, and the Georgetown Israel Alliance.
“He has been a visible LGBTQ member of a number of more mainstream campus organizations, never once denying the salience of his identity for the sake of fitting in,” GUPride said in a statement. “No one has gone to greater lengths than Tim and Reno to understand our history, issues and realities.”
The GIA, whose original proposal sent to candidates asked them to oppose Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions on Israel, caused controversy after four tickets agreed to the original proposal and subsequently reneged. Reno and Varghese signed GIA’s revised proposal that encourages campus-wide discussion and does not mention BDS, receiving the group’s endorsement.
“Tim and Reno have been a consistent force for dialogue and unity at Georgetown,” the group wrote in a statement. “We’re proud to announce their affirmation of our statement in the name of creating a safe space for Georgetown students to engage in constructive discussion around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”
Chris Wadibia (COL ’16) and Meredith Cheney (COL ’16) did not respond to multiple requests for comment about their specific endorsements. Their Facebook page includes an album called “Proud Supporters of the Movement,” and includes photos of 35 individual supporters, including Helen Brosnan (COL ’16) and Kendall Ciesemier (COL ’16), founders of campus women’s conference OWN IT, Lecture Fund Chair Marcus Stromeyer (COL ’15) and Georgetown basketball player Josh Smith (COL ’15). Ciesemier, Brosnan, Stromeyer, Wadibia and Cheney are all members of the Lecture Fund, and the ticket received individual endorsements from multiple Lecture Fund members.
“We are supporting Meredith because we believe that the campus needs a strong woman leading our campus,” Brosnan and Ciesemier wrote in their endorsement. “She is an ideal role model for underclassmen and is a source of constant optimism – something we can all learn from. Meredith owns it at all times!”

Barry Freundel, an Orthodox Jewish rabbi in the Georgetown neighborhood who also taught at Georgetown University Law Center until last year, pleaded guilty to 52 counts of misdemeanor voyeurism Thursday and will face sentencing in May.
Freundel, 62, was arrested Oct. 14 for placing recording devices at the women’s private baths at National Capital Mikvah, which is adjacent to the Kesher Israel Orthodox synagogue in Georgetown where Freundel served as rabbi.
The initial investigation, which charged Freundel with six counts of voyeurism, prompted more victims to come forward. According to The Times of Israel, prosecutors unearthed more videos in Freundel’s possession, in which the rabbi observed a total of 152 women. Due to statutes of limitations and difficulty identifying the people in the videos, Freundel was charged with only 52 counts of voyeurism.
“Bernard Freundel exploited his position of power to victimize dozens of women who entered a sacred, intimate space of religious ritual,” U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen said in a press release. “He betrayed the trust of every woman whose private moments he caught on camera along with an entire community that counted on him for moral leadership.”
Each count carries a maximum sentence of one year of incarceration, a $2,500 fine, or both, which could set Freundel’s final sentence at 52 years. The U.S. Attorney’s office will seek a heavy sentence at the hearing May 15.
“We hope that this guilty plea will allow each of his victims to move forward and heal. We will be seeking a prison sentence that reflects the gravity of this disturbing assault on the privacy and dignity of so many victims,” Machen said.
In addition to his position as a rabbi in the Georgetown neighborhood, Freundel was an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center, where he had taught a course on Jewish law since the early 1990s. He last co-taught a seminar in the spring of 2014.
An unnamed third-year law student, who said the rabbi lured her to the private baths, filed a lawsuit against the university in December for hiring the rabbi without a sufficient background check. The lawsuit is pending.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington, D.C., to speak to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday sparked a national debate about the politicization of Israel’s relationship with the United States and drew criticism from student organizations at Georgetown.
In his speech, which comes in advance of Israeli legislative elections March 17, Netanyahu will address the ongoing negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, urging the United States to take a stronger position in the talks. Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner (R-Ohio) invited Netanyahu to speak in an unprecedented move, as it is customary for the president to invite foreign leaders to make speeches before Congress.
Accordingly, Netanyahu’s visit has been criticized for dragging Israel into U.S. partisan divides, particularly as the relationship between the United States and Israel has largely remained a bipartisan priority despite increased polarization in Congress.
“From a bipartisan perspective, Israel is one of the few issues that has bipartisan support in Congress and by accepting a predominantly right-wing based offer — as an individual not representing Georgetown Israel Alliance, my greatest fear is turning Israel into a partisan issue,” GIA President Harper Weissburg (SFS ’17) said.
President Barack Obama will not be attending the speech and has declined to meet with the prime minister during his visit. Forty-one congressional Democrats and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are reportedly planning to boycott the speech because of the politicization of the meeting.
J Street, a national organization describing itself as “pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, pro-peace,” published a full-page advertisement in The New York Times that called for Netanyahu’s speech to be postponed until after the Iranian negotiations and the Israeli elections, which will both occur in the middle of March. Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16), co-president of Georgetown’s J Street U chapter, the student arm of J Street, noted the fraught timing of the speech.
“We would be happy for Netanyahu to come to Congress and present before them and speak to them but this moment in time it’s just not extremely appropriate essentially because there are these really sensitive negotiations occurring between U.S. officials and Iranian officials. Additionally, Israeli elections are around the corner,” Wartenberg said.
Netanyahu, however, addressed these contentions during a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Monday, maintaining that his speech does not aim to specifically aid any Republican agenda.
“As prime minister of Israel, I have a moral obligation to speak up in the face of these threats while there is time to avert them,” Netanyahu said. “My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to Obama or the esteemed office that he holds. I have great respect for both.”
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), who serves as marketing and external secretary for GIA but did not speak on behalf of the organization, attended Netanyahu’s speech at the AIPAC policy conference. He said that the speech did not reflect partisan issues.
“I think it sent a really strong message of unity and bipartisanship around the core interest and values which are so fundamental to the U.S.-Israel relationship, and that’s what he should have done,” Goldstein said.
Netanyahu’s speech coincides with the Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine’s Israel Apartheid Week, an annual event held at universities around the United States that protests the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip through the construction of an apartheid wall in the Intercultural Center Galleria. The week at Georgetown will run from March 2 to March 6.
SJP President Leila Shebaro (SFS ’15) also expressed discontent with Netanyahu’s invitation to Congress, although she was dissatisfied by the close relationship between the Israeli leader and the United States rather than the politicization of the partnership.
“I don’t know if you could find another leader with the same kind of record of human rights violations that consistently gets such a warm reception from American politicians,” Shebaro said.
As part of the week’s events, SJP members will gather on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol Building to protest Tuesday’s speech.
However, the SJP has faced criticism that the week, and especially the apartheid wall, is polarizing for the use of the word “apartheid” and its perceived accusatory nature.
“When an apartheid wall goes up on campus, it is an inflammatory symbol that polarizes the conversation, and it saddens me that it puts my club in a position to seem like we’re diametrically opposed to Students for Justice in Palestine, when we’re not,” Weissburg said. “We don’t get to say, ‘Oh, and I personally believe this about Netanyahu’s speech.’ We do not have the privilege of being nuanced.”
Shebaro emphasized that any open discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would bring up strongly opposing viewpoints but said the week would encourage honest reflection.
“I think that there is a difference between being antagonistic and simply being honest and being willing to have the physical conversations,” Shebaro said. “There’s nothing about what we do that we want to be unwelcoming to anyone. Our goal is really just to open up the dialogue so people feel they can have an honest conversation about the reality of the situation.”
Despite the national polarization of Netanyahu’s visit, J Street U Co-President Natalie Magioncalda (COL ’16) hoped that the university would be a place for finding common ground.
“There is so much rhetoric on both sides, and we are trying to find that space where people on all sides of the spectrum can find that common ground because there is a lot of common ground,” Magioncalda said. “It’s just very hard to see through it when you have these polarizing aspects.”

Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (GRD ’86, R-Neb.) and former Senator Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), along with former Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and former U.K. Defense Minister Desmond Browne, will discuss nuclear security threats in the 21st century at a March 16 event co-hosted by the Center for Security Studies and the International Relations Club.
Fortenberry, who currently co-chairs the Congressional Nuclear Security Caucus, and Nunn, who is the CEO of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nongovernmental organization focused on reducing the risk of the proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction, each spoke to The Hoya in advance of the event to discuss emerging threats, the ongoing Iranian nuclear negotiations and their desire to involve college students in the issue.
Fortenberry, who co-founded the nuclear security caucus in 2008, noted that advances in technology had made nuclear weapon proliferation even more dangerous, requiring the caucus as a specialized response.
“The technology for nuclear weapons making has spread very rapidly and it will only continue to spread,” Fortenberry said. “And the key here is to develop a heightened awareness and deeper understanding not only in Congress but throughout the world of the great dangers of this so that we can all try to come to some various kinds of agreements that would control particularly the materials that go into nuclear weapons production.”
Of particular concern to Fortenberry was the danger of nuclear material, or even entire weapons, falling into the hands of terrorist organizations.
“The problem in the 21st century is if a non-state actor were to get a hold of a completed nuclear weapon or the materials that could make some sort of rudimentary dirty bomb type element that wouldn’t be destructive as a nuclear weapon itself but nonetheless it could cause widespread damage and panic,” Fortenberry said.
After the September 11 attacks, worries about outdated missile technology and faulty security mechanisms were widespread. Through the efforts of the Nuclear Threat Initiative in setting up the World Institute of Nuclear Security, nuclear material has increasingly been secured around the world.
“The number of states that no longer have any loose fissile material has been cut basically in half,” Fortenberry said.
In addition to the worries over nuclear terrorism, Nunn said that the threat of nuclear war between states still loomed large.
“If you look at it, the old threats haven’t disappeared. … We’re in a new era, but we still have the old ones, so that’s the challenge,” Nunn said. “It’s pretty clear we have significant dangers in terms of possible state conflict.”
Professor of security studies and government Keir Lieber, who will deliver opening remarks at the event, concurred, explaining that the theory of mutually assured destruction, which states that the threat of retaliation would prevent countries from using nuclear weapons, was a false comfort.
“U.S. nuclear policy throughout the Cold War was to escalate conventional war to the nuclear level in order to bring that war to a halt before it was too late,” Lieber said. “Deliberate rational state use of nuclear weapons as part of a coercive escalation strategy is a real danger, and it’s not clear to me that we’ve focused enough attention on this.”
The panel comes in the middle of one such state-centered challenge, the current nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany, who are attempting to curtail Iran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons.
“Iran has had the knowledge and technical capability to at least enrich and establish their commodities,” Nunn said. “The question is if we can stop them from converting that technical knowhow into making the bomb.”
Acknowledging that governments had much more sway in diplomatic affairs than nongovernmental organizations such as NTI, Nunn said that the challenge of the negotiations was keeping domestic and foreign interests united.
“If you look at the nature of the challenges here in Iran, it’s having Congress and the president work together, and that’s obviously not happening,” Nunn said. “The second major challenge is having the United States and its key ally of Israel working together, and that’s obviously not happening. And the third challenge is keeping the countries that are engaging in the boycott together, Russia, China and Europe. That’s not an easy group to keep together.”
Fortenberry said that he had no direct involvement with the negotiation but was informally involved in diplomatic discussions around the issue: If an agreement is reached with Iran, Congress will have to vote on whether to lift sanctions on the country. Accordingly, the congressman said that the issue of nuclear weapons must be a bipartisan effort, pointing to his relationship with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) with whom he co-founded the nuclear security caucus.
“This is a matter of life and death, it’s what we call an existential issue,” Fortenberry said. “It should transcend any kind of partisan divide.”
On March 16, the two will speak at a panel at Georgetown to attempt to convince college students of the importance of nuclear security in coming years.
“It’s a complicated set of issues, and it doesn’t lend itself necessarily to motivating and exciting people,” Fortenberry said. “The tragedy of what could happen is so great that nobody really wants to look at it, think about it, so that’s why [we’re having] this event. … Hopefully, it gains momentum among the next generation for engagement.”
Since many of the goals of the Nuclear Threat Initiative require a long-term focus, such as significantly reducing the nuclear arsenal, Nunn emphasized the necessity of involving students in the issues.
“I would like to see nuclear weapons eliminated ultimately and have a world with tight verifications … but that’s many years down the road,” Nunn said. “The young generation is going to have to live with this for a long time … so having a knowledge about the dangers here and the continuing challenge for the younger generation is very, very important.”

A microcosm of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict reached the Georgetown campus this week as the Georgetown branch of Students for Justice in Palestine hosted events for Israeli Apartheid Week.
The week, which is taking place this year at universities in over 55 cities and 19 countries, includes events that protest the Israeli occupation of Gaza and support the Boycotts, Divestments and Sanctions movement. According to the event’s Facebook, the week is meant “to spark reflection on the injustices inflicted upon Palestinians, raise awareness about the historical and ongoing causes of injustice and promote dialogue about these issues in a respectful … manner.”
The week included a Monday screening of “Roadmap to Apartheid,” a documentary film produced by a Jewish Israeli and a white South African. Students participated in a protest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Tuesday speech to the United States Congress. Wednesday featured a screening of “The Promise,” a film series that compares current Israel to 1940s Palestine.
“I’m excited about Wednesday’s event because I think something that often gets overlooked is the historical reality of the issue,” SJP President Leila Shebaro (SFS ’15) said. “I think it helps to frame the modern Israeli state, the Zionist project, the Palestinian experience, all of it, in the context of the different structural controls that have existed since the opening of the century, and I think it helps people understand where Palestinians are coming from.”
On Thursday, the group hosted a discussion about the BDS movement, which advocates for the boycott of and divestment from Israeli businesses, cultural and academic institutions and sanctions on the Israeli government.
SJP contends that Israel is an apartheid state discriminates against Palestinians by limiting civil rights, restricting access to roads and water and demolishing homes. The organization constructed a wall representing the Israeli West Bank Barrier in the Intercultural Center Galleria.
“We mean a lot more than the wall,” Shebaro said. “There are a lot of structural aspects of Israeli policies and institutions that are even more the reality of apartheid than the wall itself.”
Due to its national policy of anti-normalization, SJP does not collaborate or co-sponsor events with any campus group that supports Israel.
“The policy of anti-normalization is that we’ll only engage with organizations that essentially come at the situation recognizing explicitly that Israel is an occupying state and that occupation is the cause of the conflict and the violence,” Shebaro said. “We’re not going to work with an organization that is not committed to justice for all people including Palestinians.”
In response to this policy, student groups including the Georgetown Israel Alliance and J Street U Georgetown hosted their own events to share varying perspectives.
GIA created a discussion table in the ICC on Thursday to speak to students with questions about Israeli Apartheid Week. GIA President Harper Weissburg (SFS ’17) said that she would have liked to work with SJP to encourage discussion.
“We are not in a position to co-sponsor with SJP, which kills us,” Weissburg said. “We’d love to have that discussion, but because of this [anti-normalization] policy that is not in the cards.”
GIA disagrees with SJP’s claim that Israel is an apartheid state and adamantly opposes BDS.
“Israel is not an apartheid state, blanket statement,” Weissburg said. “It is a misrepresentation of the horrific apartheid in South Africa and although GIA is first to admit that Israel, like all states, is not a perfect state and yes, racism exists in Israel as it exists in all states, apartheid is the de jure institutionalization of racism, the creation of a second-class citizenry if you will. And that is not the case in Israel.”
Also due to its anti-normalization policy, SJP has refused to work with J Street U, although the organization does acknowledge Palestinian oppression and Israeli human rights violations.
“We get a lot of questions about why we don’t work with J Street in particular, because they are the more moderate organization,” Shebaro said. “I think my problem, and the institutional problem with J Street, is that they have a tendency to portray the treatment of Palestinians … as unfortunate necessities or consequences of [Palestinians] being violent or [Israelis] being provoked.”
J Street U Co-President Natalie Magioncalda (COL ’16) said that the organization opposes BDS but wants to encourage an open dialogue.
“J Street unequivocally opposes the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement,” Magioncalda said. “We are open to open dialogue around BDS, but we don’t support BDS, because we feel that illustrates the conflict in black-and-white terms.”
Co-President Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16) agreed with Magioncalda and added that she does not think BDS proposes any viable solution.
“Instead of trying to sit down and have those conversations with people on the other side … it is saying let’s reject Israel, let’s reject their institutions, let’s reject their industries and in doing this, draw attention to it. I think the only way to move forward is to have more conversations between people,” Wartenberg said.
J Street hosted its own discussion on Wednesday to discuss the SJP’s classification of Israel as an apartheid state, and even invited SJP to the event, despite the anti-normalization policy.
Wartenberg explained that J Street U’s more neutral approach to the issue and purpose of its event aimed to stimulate dialogue.
“We got involved in this week because we felt that … the rhetoric surrounding Israeli Apartheid Week hurt our cause to find peace and coexistence between the two peoples and work towards that two state solution. We felt that using words like ‘apartheid’ and ‘genocide’ made it a one-sided conversation, and polarized the conflict, delegitimized Israel in a way,” Wartenberg said. “We wanted to open up a place for discussion rather than leading the week to become more polarizing.”

Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times journalists C.J. Chivers and Tyler Hicks discussed their experiences as war reporters in Ukraine, Syria and on other fronts.
The Wednesday night conversation, held in the Intercultural Center Auditorium, was the inaugural event in the Georgetown journalism program’s Salim El-Lozi Lecture Series. The lecture series honors the memory of El-Lozi, a Lebanese political journalist who was kidnapped and murdered in 1980 for voicing his criticism of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, and Libya’s Muammar al-Gaddafi. Each lecture to follow in the series will focus on international freedom of the press and the First Amendment.
Chivers, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps after graduating college in 1987, began reporting in 1995. He has reported as a foreign correspondent from Israel, Afghanistan, Iraq, Russia and Uzbekistan. Hicks is a photojournalist who is currently based in Kenya but has covered news in Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Chechnya, among others since 1992.
The event was moderated by Alex Horton (COL ’14), a lecturer in the journalism program, who began by asking Chivers and Hicks about their understanding of journalistic ethics in a war zone. Chivers said that he and Hicks avoided interfering with the squads that took them into the field, and that he was constantly concerned that his curiosity might endanger the lives of others.
“From the moment you’ve diverted the activity or the direction or the decisions of the people you’re with, if anything happens it’s on your soul,” Chivers said.
The two returned multiple times to a particular incident in Afghanistan in which they went out with a patrol. One of the men on the patrol was killed in a surprise ambush. Hicks, who had to swim across a river and nearly became hypothermic, remembers it as one of the worst nights of his life.
“It takes a lot to go out there, physically, emotionally, to put yourself in that place,” Hicks said. “Months of planning, and then you want to document what’s happening, you want to have a record, especially when there has been a causality. These guys deserve to have their stories told.”
“You’re in a tunnel, everything vanishes,” Chivers said of the ambush. “You have to toggle between your safety concerns, which are constant, and being able to inform the reader you’re out there because you’re not out there for you, you’re out there for your readers. Everything you do has to have a journalistic purpose.”
Chivers and Hicks reflected on how journalism has changed in recent years, specifically focusing on new threats to journalists in the field. When unable to travel with American forces, Chivers and Hicks began performing detailed risk assessments before entering conflict zones.
“Before we would do the trip we had thought through as many contingencies as we could have,” Chivers said. “That’s not going to protect you. What it does is it builds hesitation into what you’re doing and it has a plan so somebody is working on it if something goes wrong … but you can’t anticipate all the risks.”
When Hicks and Chivers were reporting in Syria in 2013, the Syrian Civil War had escalated, making it extremely unsafe to report in the country. Hicks said that it is important for a journalist to recognize when to leave a situation if it becomes too dangerous.
“You get to a point where you can’t work in a place anymore,” Hicks said. “There is no way I would go there now. It would be irresponsible for me and everyone around me. It’s literally suicide to go there now as a Westerner.”
Hicks also spoke about his Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting of the 2013 Westgate Nairobi mall massacre. As the decision to enter the mall was spontaneous, Hicks was unable to make detailed risk assessments or contingency plans.
“I can’t deny that it’s a selfish act to go and take that kind of chance. It’s selfish because if something happens to me, my family and my friends have to deal with the consequences,” Hicks said.
Chivers and Hicks both emphasized that they did not want to glamorize war reporting.
“[War reporting is] exceptionally dangerous. It’s not as valuable as people would have you believe,” Chivers said. “It is part of a mosaic of understanding a conflict. The frontline experientialist approach is an element … but it is no more important than covering the mosques and the schools.”
The consequences of war reporting extend far beyond bodily harm. When an audience member asked how Chivers and Hicks cope with what they have seen and experienced in the field, they spoke about the challenges they and their peers faced when they returned home from war zones.
“It’s not a good line of work and it’s not good for you, and I would say a huge fraction of our peer group — and we would include ourselves in that fraction — are screwed up,” Chivers said. “The alcoholism rates, the divorce rates, the substance abuse rates, the problems with coping and the various understandable afflictions that beset people who are exposed to trauma and violence.”
“I’m a very different person than I was before this type of work,” Hicks said. “You feel less entitled to have certain pleasures in life and that starts to affect your family. It’s a difficult transition. … It’s terrible being in these places; you find yourself in so much heightened stress and fear.”
A former Marine squad leader in the audience asked Chivers and Hicks if they ever reached the point where they felt they had to put down the camera to help the soldiers around them.
“There have been a few times when we have stepped in,” Chivers said.“Those are exceptionally rare. We’ve carried stretchers of wounded guys, we’ve applied bandages, we’ve held hands of people and poured water into the mouths of people who were shot or wounded. We’re human beings first.”
Alexandra Chinchilla (SFS ’15) and Bianca DiSanto (MSB ’17) both said that they were struck by the honest commentary Chivers and Hicks shared.
“I was really surprised that they were that honest. They sat down with us and they told us basically, ‘Don’t go into this profession because the risks have changed and there is an emotional cost to it,’” Chinchilla said.
“I am not from a journalism background or interest remotely, so it brought up a lot of issues and ethical questions that I had never really considered before,” DiSanto said. “A lot of it resonated with me and it felt very real and raw.”

Since he founded the Preparing Global Leaders Foundation, a nonprofit organization aimed at teaching leadership skills to students and young professionals three years ago, President Sam Potolicchio (COL ’02, GRD ’11) has expanded the foundation’s programs worldwide to engage hundreds of aspiring global leaders.
The foundation organizes conferences that consist of short courses and workshops on diplomatic affairs, conflict resolution, social justice and leadership skills. The conferences, which are held in Russia, Jordan and Macedonia, last one to two weeks and include around 50 participants from 40 different countries.
Currently, there are already approximately 20 Georgetown student volunteers involved in promotion, research and other duties.
Although the courses are mainly taught by professors from around the world, the conferences have hosted numerous public figures in the past few years, including Editor of Politico Magazine Garrett Graff and the former Press Secretary for the Prince of Wales Colleen Harris. In addition to lectures, participants take part in simulations, such as mock interviews and mock parliaments.
Potolicchio said that the goal of the conference is to bring together young leaders from different backgrounds.
“I believe that if you have this approach and utilize different perspectives, particularly differences of nationality, religion, race and gender, then you can cultivate a different type of mindset in aspiring public servants and leaders,” Potolicchio said.
In particular, Potolicchio said that the conferences are a platform for young leaders from conflict zones around the world to engage in dialogue with one another.
“Friendships are formed here between students from conflict zones: Serbia, Kosovo, Russia, Ukraine, Palestine, Lebanon, Israel and more. We’re really advancing some important issues here and creating a dialogue instead of just a monologue between countries that have difficulties with each other,” Potolicchio said.
Several Georgetown students and faculty have participated in previous conferences. For instance, government professor Clyde Wilcox taught a course on public speaking at the Jordan program.
PGLF Chief of Staff Danny Aherne (COL ’16) said that professors at the conferences offer their guidance even outside of the classroom.
“We try to find professors that are not only the top in their field, but that are dynamic and engaging and care about their students,” Aherne said. “At the end of the day, you want people who are not only going to engage students in class, but also outside of the class.”
Government professor Marc Morjé Howard taught a mini-course on democracy in the Moscow program and serves on the board of PGLF.
“Even though the PGLF programs are often quite, they leave a tremendous and lasting impact on the students, both personally and professionally,” Howard said. “PGLF students come away with deep and lasting cross-national friendships, along with skills that prepare them for leadership positions in their home countries and the world.”
According to Aherne, participants form close relationships with professors at the conferences.
“Our professors will eat all their meals with the students,” Aherne said. “They build sort of a family to the point where people are crying at the end just because they don’t want to see everyone go, because then they scatter back to the corners of the earth.”
Dylan Kaplan (COL ’15), who attended the program at Moscow last summer, said that he developed his leadership skills at the conference.
“One of the most important things I learned was how to improve my ability to connect with the audience when public speaking,” Kaplan said. “Dr. Potolicchio also convinced me that leadership isn’t just something you are born with, but is something you can learn and leadership can be taught.”
Additionally, Kaplan said that he formed numerous friendships with other participants.
“The program had some of the smartest students from around the world,” Kaplan said. “My favorite part was spending time with the other participants. We explored Moscow together, went out at night together and really became great friends. The participants came from the Middle East, Europe and almost every stretch of the globe. … The program was one of the most memorable weeks of my life.”
Executive Director of PGLF in Skopje and Struga, Macedonia, Angela Velkova, said that the participants, who came from various backgrounds, were able to share their culture with one another. Velkova cited the Country Presentation Night as an example, during which participants present the folklore, culture and food of their countries.
“This is a night of revelations,” Velkova said. “One cannot choose words to describe the emotions when we see unfolding in front of our eyes scenes of Iraqi participants waiving an American flag, Georgian, Russians and Ukrainians dancing ‘Casatchok,’ Serbs and Kosovars singing ‘Gjurgjevdan.’ It is a unique experience.”
This summer, the conferences will take place in Jordan and Macedonia from May 23 to 30 and August 11 to 23, respectively. In previous years, PGLF has received approximately 1,000 applications for around 50 spots.
Additionally, the foundation offers financial aid for admitted participants. According to Aherne, one of their goals is to shift to a tuition free model, which would require a significant amount of fundraising in the future.
In addition to the prospect of becoming tuition free, Potolicchio said that he hopes to expand the program to all regions of the world.
“We are progressively expanding, so we’d like to kind of have a signature school in every single region in the world, and it’s catching on,” Potolicchio said. “Almost every single delegate that comes to this program comes to me and says, ‘I want to start this program in my country.’”

2015-04-27,Georgetown,Israel,"April 27, 2015 by Toby Hung 1 Comment 
This article has been updated from its original version on April 27.
In response to two separate protests organized by the Westboro Baptist Church and the Official Street Preachers outside of the university’s front gates today, hundreds of students gathered in a counter-protest at the front gates and in a solidarity event in Red Square.
Two weeks ago, the WBC announced on their website that they would be protesting at Georgetown, citing the university’s acceptance of LGBTQ students.
At approximately 12 p.m., members of the Official Street Preachers, a protest group unaffiliated with the WBC, began protesting at Red Square with inflammatory signs. This protest was unannounced. Georgetown University Police Department officers escorted them to the front gates, where they continued picketing.
GUPD Chief of Police Jay Gruber said that he warned the OPS protesters to leave Red Square as they were trespassing on private property.
“[I] alerted them that the university is private property, and they tried to argue that point, and I just let them know that they could leave and protest outside the main gates or they would be arrested for trespassing, [then] they took the smarter route and went out to the main gates, [which is] public property [and] they had every right to say what they wanted to say,” Gruber said.
Several students who attended the counter-protest exchanged remarks with OSP members, who were barred from the front gates by GUPD officers.
In addition, students held signs of their own in support of the LGBTQ community and played music through loudspeakers to counter the OSP. The OSP members left the front gates at approximately 2:30 p.m.
According to OSP member Ruben Israel, the OSP, who did not announce the protest before today, arrived in Washington, D.C. last Friday to protest against the U.S. Supreme Court’s hearing on same-sex marriage tomorrow.
Israel also said that the protest was not affiliated with the WBC protest later in the day.
Vice President for Mission and Ministry Rev. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., who observed the counter-protest, said that he was pleased with how the students interacted with OSP members.
“I’m very proud of our students who engaged them constructively,” O’Brien said.
At 4 p.m., approximately 10 members of the WBC arrived on the street across from the front gates. More students congregated at the counter-protest, holding signs and shouting chants in opposition to the WBC.
The counter-protest also included faculty members and people outside of the Georgetown community. Some attendees arrived at the protest in costumes.
Associate professor of theater Natsu Onoda Power, who attended the counter-protest with students in her Gender and Performance class, set up a suggestion box for students and faculty to write in comments for the WBC. Power was unsure as to how the suggestions would be given to the WBC.
“A student in the class came up with the idea to not so much do a counter-protest, but [do this] in a peaceful way, not to pick fights, but to try to understand them while expressing our views,” Power said.
Breanne Kincaid (COL ’16), an organizer of the counter-protest, also set up a donation box for the Trevor Project and Casa Ruby LGBT Community Center, two initiatives in support of LGBTQ youth, at the front gates. They received $41 in cash donations in less than one hour.
At one point during the protest, a D.C. Circulator bus blocked the WBC from the students’ view as it was passing the intersection at 37th street, which prompted cheers and applause from students.
GUPD and Metropolitan Police Department officers prevented members of the WBC from crossing the street to the front gates with a metal blockade. The blockade was removed when the WBC members departed at approximately 4:20 p.m.
Gruber said he was satisfied with the outcome of the protest and counter-protest, for which the GUPD, MPD and university administration have been planning over the past week.
“The students got to express their first amendment rights. The protesters had an opportunity to express their first amendment rights. Nobody was injured, traffic flowed normally. So I was happy with the results,” Gruber said.
According to Kincaid, student support for the LGBTQ community dwarfed the WBC protest.
“Hoyas and non-Hoyas came out in droves to show messages of support for the entire LGBTQ community, which is all that I could have asked for,” Kincaid said. “We filled every available space in front of campus with our message of positivity and solidarity.”
Ben Goodfriend (COL ’18), who attended the counter-protest in his underwear, said also that he was pleased the WBC were unable to communicate their message to students.
“[The protest] was very underwhelming. I think the counter-protest completely drowned them out. They really didn’t stand a chance,” Goodfriend said. “I’m just proud that we can all show our support and not let them get to us and infect us. I know that they’re really trying to get to our head, and I know it didn’t work.”
Kincaid said that while she did not expect the WBC to listen to students’ opinions in the counter-protest, she felt that the students effectively demonstrated their support for the Georgetown LGBTQ community.
“Any sort of meaningful dialogue with [the WBC] would fall on deaf ears. However, I think the event was effective in demonstrating overwhelming support for our own LGTBQ Hoyas,” Kincaid said. “I think we made a difference today by showing the world that Hoyas stand up for Hoyas.”
During the protest and counter-protest at the front gates, GUPride hosted a solidarity event at Red Square, where leaders from different student groups and the administration shared their thoughts in solidarity with the LGBTQ community.
The event consisted of speeches and a prayer led by Fr. Raymond Kemp. Additionally, GUPride distributed buttons and materials to create signs.
GUPride President Campbell James (SFS ’17) said that the event brought together different members of the community to back the LGBTQ community.
“It’s been phenomenal seeing the support of everyone. I think it really shows that Georgetown is a large, united community and we all care about each other as students,” James said. “It’s been really humbling to see the support of so many administrators, students and student groups.”
Similarly, GUPride Treasurer Nicholas Werner (MSB ’17) said that they intended for the event to bring the community together, rather than engage members of the WBC directly.
“The WBC is an evil organization that we really can’t combat by directly confronting them. The only response we can actually get is to come together as a community,” Werner said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson, who attended the solidarity event, said that he was proud of students’ willingness to express their beliefs in opposition to those of the WBC.
“I had heard from the first announcement that these people were going to be in the neighborhood that I thought our students would stand up and express their views and concerns, and they have,” Olson said.
Protestant Chaplaincy Director Reverend Bryant Oskvig said in a speech that it is important to respond to the WBC in a peaceful manner.
“Darkness doesn’t overcome darkness, light overcomes darkness. Hate doesn’t overcome hate. … [Love] will overcome the darkness in our world, and that’s what makes this beautiful, and that is the witness of our tradition and our faith,” Oskvig said.
After the solidarity event, the Georgetown University Alumni Association, GUPride, Grad Pride and Students of Georgetown, Inc. organized a fundraiser at the Bulldog Tavern in response to the WBC protest, where drinks were sold for donations to the Trevor Project and the Casa Ruby LGBT Community Center.
Former Georgetown University Student Association President Nate Tisa (SFS ’14), who was an organizer of the fundraiser, said that he wanted to leverage the opportunity of the protest to raise funds for a beneficial cause.
“In the face of people who espouse hate at that level and really cannot be reasoned with, there’s no productive dialogue to be had,” Tisa said. “So we’re trying to envision a response that would be productive and positive, be affirming and actually do some good. If they’re going to come to campus and raise this level of negative energy, we might as well use it to produce something positive.”

I never see this sort of response, but literally the best thing that could be done when Westboro decides to come to a particular campus or funeral or event would be to completely ignore them.  Don’t write about them, don’t counter-protest, don’t even acknowledge their existence.  They *want* this sort of attention; they thrive off of it — it stirs up their base and gives them broader media exposure (“no news is bad news”).  They should just be ignored.

Upon descending the stairs to the second floor of the Intercultural Center, a quaint but easily overlooked sculpture can be observed toward the right wall. The bronze statue depicts a scene in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, in which the titular character embraces his father after returning from a path of rebellion.
Only a handful of people know that the statue was brought to Georgetown by former Senior Jewish Chaplain Rabbi Harold S. White, who approached its sculptor, Barry Woods Johnston, in 1983. To many members of the community, White himself charted an iconoclastic path at the university.
As the first full-time Jewish chaplain at a Catholic university in the United States, White persistently defied traditional boundaries set by religious and political doctrines. He sought a deeper connection and understanding between people of all religious and cultural backgrounds through his work in the Jewish ministry, his founding of the Program for Jewish Civilization and the hundreds of interfaith weddings he officiated over the past half a century.
White died Aug. 31 of complications from a stroke. He was 83 years old.
In a university-wide email sent on the day White passed away, University President John J. DeGioia commended White for his impact on Georgetown as an institution that welcomes diversity.
“Rabbi White’s devotion to our shared values and our mission as a community was unparalleled,” DeGioia wrote. “His leadership and vision in creating opportunities for dialogue strengthened our community and helped build the ethos of engagement that characterizes our campus ministry today.”
White is survived by his son, Ross McQuilkin. The university will hold a memorial service in celebration of White’s life on Sept. 20 in Gaston Hall.
Yotzei Dofen
Born in 1932 to Jewish immigrants from Austria, White grew up in Connecticut and studied philosophy at Wesleyan University before receiving his rabbinical ordination at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.
White arrived at Georgetown in 1968, three years after the Vatican released “Nostra Aetate,” a declaration that repudiated the Catholic Church’s prior prejudices against Jews and other practitioners of non-Christian faiths.
According to PJC Associate Director Rev. Dennis McManus, White was not hired to serve Jewish students, as there were very few on campus at the time. Rather, the rabbi was tasked with educating the entire student body about Judaism.
“Harold White was ‘Nostra Aetate’ at Georgetown. He’s the one who opened the door for us to understand that on a daily basis. He’s the one who got us going. The most important thing he did was consent to that job offer,” McManus said.
From then on, White’s dedication to interreligious understanding transformed Georgetown. Students of all religious backgrounds frequently crowded the hallway outside his Healy Hall office, competing for a time slot to engage the rabbi in discussion.
For many in the Jewish community, White is best remembered in his rabbinical robe, delivering sermons on the stage of Gaston Hall for High Holy Days services, open to the general public.
Israel Klein (COL ’99), a friend and former student of White’s, said that even after he graduated, he returned to Georgetown to attend White’s sermons.
“You really had to make it a point to get there early. They are extremely well attended,” Klein said. “The way [White] conducted a service was really inclusive. It was open and accessible to everybody. You were made to feel at home.”
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rachel Gartner, who assumed White’s position after he retired in 2010, said that he solidified Georgetown as a welcoming institution to Jewish students.
“Over my last four years here. I’ve heard repeatedly [from Jewish alumni] that it was Rabbi White who made Georgetown feel like home for them,” Gartner said.
Theology and fine arts Professor Ori Soltes, who was initially recommended for a teaching position at Georgetown by White two decades ago, described him as yotzei dofen, a Hebrew phrase that roughly translates to “outstanding.”
“I think of him as not just outstanding, but in the etymological sense of the Hebrew, as someone beyond the norm,” Soltes said. “He was always reaching in different directions that took him away from the safely circumscribed, the mainstream. And often, he ended up bringing the mainstream, dragging it with him in the direction he took.”
White was not only known for bridging religious groups in the public sphere. He also played a significant role in the personal lives of many interfaith couples. At a time when interfaith marriages were still relatively unaccepted by most religious communities, many turned to White to perform their ceremonies.
White officiated the wedding of Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson (CAS ’89) and Jennifer Beard (CAS ’89). The Jewish-Catholic couple met at Georgetown, and asked the rabbi and Rev. James Shea, S.J., to preside over their nuptials.
Smulson said that the rabbi provided endless guidance for the marriage.
“As we were leading up to our wedding, Rabbi really reinforced our patience and understanding with each other,” Smulson said. “It wasn’t always easy, but to have Rabbi and Fr. Shea there was a big part of our lives.”
An Inspired Teacher
Beyond his role in the Jewish chaplaincy and ministry, both students and faculty said they considered White an incredible and highly knowledgeable educator.
Vice President for Mission and Ministry Fr. Kevin O’Brien, S.J., said that White’s teachings were instrumental to his development as a Catholic priest.
“My relationship with [White] has made me a better person, a better Catholic, a better priest,” O’Brien said. “He helped me to understand my own Christian tradition in a new way from a Jewish perspective. … [He was] an inspired teacher.”
From his first days at Georgetown, White longed to create an academic center focusing on the different dimensions of Judaism, according to McManus. After an extensive fundraising period under his leadership, the Program for Jewish Civilization was launched as a program within the School of Foreign Service in late 2003.
After he retired, he continued to serve as an advisor to the program, which also saw the establishment of the Harold White Chair in Jewish Civilization made possible by alumni donations.
Next February, the PJC will officially be expanded into the Center for Jewish Civilization, which will push forward plans to create a major and a master of arts degree in Jewish civilization.
McManus said that the center is a testament to White’s continued influence on Georgetown.
“He knew about this before he passed, and that elicited a huge smile. He understood this was actually going to happen and we were going to be a center. It was the culmination of his life’s work,” McManus said.
Aside from the PJC, White was a professor who brought his endless thirst for knowledge to the lecture hall.
McManus, who co-taught a popular course on the dialogue between the Abrahamic religions called “Interreligious Encounter and Dialogue” with White and Imam Yahya Hendi, said that White’s approach to teaching was dynamic and engaging.
“He’d make his notes fresh every single time. He’d come in and say, ‘You know what, I’ve changed my view on something.’ [It was] a new surprise a week,” McManus said. “‘Why not?’ he would say. ‘Why not continue to change? It means that you’re growing and seeing new things. You should bring them in. You shouldn’t be afraid of that.’”
Hesham El Abd (GSB ’76), another friend and former student, agreed that White consistently welcomed new perspectives into the classroom.
“I was the only non-Jewish student in his class,” El Abd said. “You can imagine, I’m sitting there and you have 15, 17 Jewish students. He would say, ‘Okay, Hesham, but what about Islam?’ It added to the discussion and dialogue.”
El Abd continued a friendship that lasted decades with the rabbi, who had made plans to spend Thanksgiving with him in Cairo this year.
White also co-officiated El Abd’s wedding in 1983. Neither the bride nor groom was Jewish — he was Muslim, she was Presbyterian. Still, White performed a ceremony unique to El Abd and his wife.
“You could plan any wedding with Harold, and Harold would wake up that morning, decide what he’s going to do and he’d do it,” El Abd said. “You don’t call the rabbi if you want it to be by the book.”
Marin
In his lifetime, White fostered relationships that transcended religious, cultural and political borders.
“Thousands of people would say that he was their friend, and they would all be absolutely correct,” said Richard Chused, a former professor at the Georgetown University Law Center and a friend whose wedding White officiated.
Hendi, who became the first full-time Muslim chaplain hired by a Catholic university in 1999, pointed to a memorable experience in which he, Rev. Raymond Kemp and White blessed each other at the Jordan River during a trip that focused on interfaith dialogue.
“How rare would it have been for a Christian to be blessed by a Muslim and a Jew? People started taking pictures of this, and we became celebrities for almost half an hour,” Hendi said.
For Hendi, White’s connection with others stemmed from his marin, an Arabic word that means flexibility or elasticity.
“He wanted for everyone to be happy,” Hendi said. “He was one of those people who were naturally not willing to fight.”
Yet, despite his easygoing nature, White fought tirelessly for a society that embraced differences.  He was an advocate for not only religious but also racial equality, having participated in the civil rights movement in 1961 as a Freedom Rider.
PJC Director Jacques Berlinerblau said that White’s acceptance was a rare quality that left a lasting impression on those who knew him.
“He was an enemy of close-mindedness, philistinism, homophobia, racism and any type of prejudice,” Berlinerblau said. “He didn’t look at somebody and just draw assumptions from that. For an 83-year-old Jewish man, having gone through what Jews had gone through in the 20th century, that was sublime.”
Correction: White co-officiated the wedding of Erik Smulson and Jennifer Beard with Rev. James Shea, S.J., rather than Rev. James Schall, S.J., as the original article incorrectly stated.

Sad to read of the passing of Rabbi White. Should all folks take a
page from his book, this would be a better World for sure.
I too, find enemies with close minded, judgmental and racist
individuals. Conversation and an openness creates the way to
true understanding.
I’m new to Georgetown, so it’s my loss, for not being able to
meet this Mench.

Nearly 200 students packed the Healey Family Student Center Social Room Wednesday night to listen to two experts on nuclear proliferation, Professor Matthew Kroenig and National Security Advisor to the Vice President Colin Kahl debate the recent accord reached with Iran.  The event was hosted by the College Democrats and co-sponsored by the Georgetown Israel Alliance, the International Relations Club, J Street U and the Security Studies Program. The debate was moderated by Ariane Tabatabai, a visiting professor for the SSP.
In the event, Kroenig argued against the deal, while Kahl expressed his support for it. Both acknowledged that the deal was nearly guaranteed to pass in Congress, a prediction that was proven correct when Democrats blocked a resolution of disapproval of the deal from going to vote.
While the debate marks the third time the two have clashed over Iranian proliferation, it is the first time they have publically debated about the topic in person. In 2012, Kroenig published an article in Foreign Affairs titled “Time to Attack Iran,” to which Kahl replied in the next issue with a rebuttal, “Not Time to Attack Iran.” Two years later, Kroenig published another piece in support of an attack in Foreign Affairs, to which Kahl replied for the second time with an article titled “Still Not Time to Attack Iran.”
Before starting the debate, Tabatabai provided an overview of the deal.
“What it aims to do is to ensure that Iran is prevented from creating nuclear weapons by enforcing international inspections and reducing Iran’s nuclear capabilities. In exchange, Iran is going to receive sanctions relief, which are hurting Iran’s economy,” Tabatabai said.
The debate began with three-minute opening statements from Kroenig and Kahl. Following the opening statements, the debate rotated the questions between the debaters with a two-minute response to a question followed by a one-minute rebuttal and 30-second counter-rebuttal.
In his opening remarks, Kroenig expressed doubts about Iran’s trustworthiness and asserted that the deal was only short-term, allowing Iran to expand its conventional weapons programs.
“We need to be skeptical. We’re dealing with a dangerous adversary,” Kroenig said. “There is a difference between operating a peaceful nuclear program, operating reactors for research or energy purposes and making the fuel for those reactors, because once you have the ability to make the fuel for reactors, you also have the ability to make the fuel for nuclear weapons.”
Kroenig continued by pointing out benchmarks of the deal that allow Iran to buy conventional weapons in six years and have ballistic missiles by eight years time, which he argued would allow them to build Intercontinental Ballastic Missiles that could hit the East Coast.
On the other hand, Kahl expressed his support for the deal, labelling it as a diplomatic way to resolve the conflict.
“What the president has made clear from the beginning is that a peaceful diplomatic solution is ultimately the most enduring and sustainable solution to this problem, and that’s the solution that we have,” Kahl said.
Kahl further argued that the deal was an effective long-term solution.
“It’s a good deal. It closes off the various pathways by which Iran could get a bomb; the uranium pathway, the plutonium pathway and the covert pathway,” Kahl said. “Right now, without this deal, Iran could produce highly enriched uranium for its first nuclear weapon in as little as two to three months,”
Throughout the debate, Kahl referred to Kroenig’s arguments for a better deal as “crazy talk” and “fantasy,” suggesting that other countries would abandon negotiations if the United States gave up the deal.
Kroenig responded by saying that Kahl was stuck in a “White House echo chamber.”
“I’m the one living in the real world, who understands power dynamics and understands these issues,” Kroenig said.
Katie Kelly (SFS ’19) said she attended the event because she wanted to hear alternative views on the Iran deal.
“Before the event I was mainly against the deal,” Kelly said. “I felt if there was lifted sanctions there would be more money that the Iranian government could deal to anti-American terrorist groups, and both sides agreed on that point.”
Jawad Pullin (COL ’18), a member of the College Democrats who helped to organize the event, said he supports the deal and hopes the event sparked dialogue.
“[We wanted it to be] an objective debate to bring the campus out to see two sides of the issue,” Pullin said.

Anglican priest Naim Ateek and Mandela Institute for Palestinian Prisoners co-founder Jonathan Kuttab discussed several issues faced by the Christian minority in Israel and Palestine in a panel discussion in Copley Formal Lounge on Friday.
The event, which was titled “Christians in the Holy Land,” was organized by the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. Around 10 attendees joined Ateek and Kuttab in the discussion.
Ateek, who is a native of Palestine and a former canon of St. George’s Cathedral in Jerusalem, is the co-founder of the Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center, an organization dedicated to overcoming denominational barriers to peace in Israel and Palestine.
Kuttab, who serves on the board of SELTC, is a practicing lawyer in Washington, D.C. and Israel, where he specializes in human rights violations and social justice in Palestine.
According to Ateek, he founded SELTC with the intention of joining Muslims and Christians together through dialogue.
“SELTC took on itself that responsibility of trying to really bring the Muslims and the Christians together,” Ateek said. “This interfaith ministry is trying to bring down any prejudices between our communities, yet there is still so much more to be done.”
As the discussion progressed, Ateek highlighted the achievements of Palestinian Christians in establishing interfaith networks and community-building institutions. He also discussed particular instances in which the Christian minority continues to be victims of racism and violence.
“[The Christian community] has a number of organizations — not only schools, but clinics, hospitals, guest houses — and we make sure there is no discrimination on any basis, including religion,” Ateek said. “Yet Israel is an apartheid state — a racist state — and racism is spiraling. Many of the outside settlers coming into Palestine are burning churches, and there is no action on the part of Israel.”
Over the course of the discussion, audience member Kathy Aquilina, the program director of local nonprofit Initiatives of Change, commented on Ateek’s views of Zionist settlers in Palestine and the violence they influence.
“One of the scourges against Palestinians are some Americans who have become stridently religious settlers who exhibit violence and racism against them,” Aquilina said. “[Palestinians] feel that the United States has continually disappointed them by not standing up for justice in the area.”
Ateek recalled his own experience with early Zionist settlers during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The conflict broke out as a result of tension between Zionists and Arabs as a result of the negative feedback to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which displaced more than 700,000 native Palestinians.
“Israel has never treated Christians in any special way,” Ateek said. “I recall that I was a boy in 1948 when the Zionists came and occupied our town. There were Christians and Muslims living in it, and the Zionists drove us out and we had nothing. To them we were just Palestinians, and they wanted to occupy the land and everything we owned was confiscated. The discrimination going on today has continued and is against Christians and Muslims.”
Kuttab then turned the conversation toward questions on the implementation and practice of international law and human rights as a way to protect the Christian minority.
“The battle for human rights, for international law, for equality before the law, is no longer theoretical and theological and academic,” Kuttab said. “It becomes an issue of practical, daily survival. The reality is that there are laws on the book that lead necessarily to discrimination, to racism, to denial of rights. This is where we must concentrate our efforts.”
Kuttab then mentioned that while there are laws in Israel that protect individuals from racism and discrimination, these laws only apply to Israeli citizens and do not extend to non-Jewish individuals living in the Palestinian territories.
“If a system of law and a legal system grant rights to one particular portion of the population and denies it to a portion of the population on the basis of religion or race or creed, then it has a name. It is called apartheid, and it is evil and improper and worthy of a fight against it,” Kuttab said.
Afterward, the panel opened up the discussion to the audience. Fr. Drew Christiansen, S.J., the co-director of the Program on the Church and the World in the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, asked both panelists to go into further detail on the space nonviolence plays in pushing for equality and justice among Palestinians.
“I really wanted to know what space there was for nonviolence,” Christiansen said. “The Israelis don’t allow nonviolent demonstrations to occur, so the military action and police action that occur, depending on what side of the green line you’re on, most often prevent there from being any nonviolent resistance. And without that kind of space, you are going to have clashing.”
Kuttab responded to Christiansen’s question by discussing the role nonviolence should play in the activism for justice and equality, while linking the theme of this activism to faith and Christian dogma.
“I think nonviolence is the only effective method and Palestinians have practiced it intermittently with varying results,” Kuttab said. “Nonviolence has to be the only way because violence only breeds more violence. We must find a better way than to out-violence the other side. Nonviolence is the way to go.”

Georgetown will host its fifth TEDx conference tomorrow in Gaston Hall. With the theme of “Risk Takers,” the daylong event will be divided into three different sections, with the subthemes “Inspiring the Uninspired,” “Fail Forward” and “High Risk, High Reward.” Each section will feature four speakers highlighting different stages or factors in the risk-taking process. After each session, participants will also have the opportunity to interact with speakers and reflect on the topics discussed in breakout sessions, a new addition to this year’s programming.
TEDx, which is a national program of nonprofit, self-organized local events, is a subset of the TED global conference series. In previous years, dozens of TEDx events have been hosted in the Washington, D.C. area.
The program features a diverse range of students, faculty and contributors from outside of the university, including partnerships with restaurants and food vendors at TasTED and a food market in Healy Circle on Saturday. Tickets for TEDx, which are free for Georgetown students and $20 for nonstudents, are available for reservation online.
 
Caroline James (COL ’16)
James, a senior in the College studying government, environmental studies and music, will discuss her experience participating in a political protest and her subsequent arrest.
“It is about the way that civil disobedience and aspects of risk-taking are a way to participate in the democratic process,” James said. “I want people to come away with the sense of what their various passions mean to them.”
James has led environmental efforts on campus through her role as secretary of sustainability for the Georgetown University Student Association, as well as her role in GU Fossil Free. She directs the Georgetown Environmental Leaders initiative, a coalition of student groups, academic departments and university offices that work toward sustainability goals.
James partook in a study abroad program in 2014 to Denmark, Sweden and Germany, where she studied corporate social responsibility and renewable energy systems.
Outside of Georgetown, James has worked for several sustainability organizations, including Environment Georgia, the American Council on Renewable Energy and Sustainable Business International. With SBI, she authored a chapter of an upcoming book about the sustainable wine industry. James intends to enter environmental policy or environmental consulting upon her graduation.
Darius Baxter (COL ’16)
Baxter is a senior in the College studying women’s and gender studies with a concentration in globalization and poverty.
Baxter’s speech will focus on various anecdotes from his personal experience.
“I plan to inspire the crowd by sharing little bits of my life story and weaving those stories together in order to hopefully bring people a little bit of happiness,” Baxter said.
Baxter has had an eclectic Georgetown experience, from congressional internships to partnering with an all-natural Colombian coffee startup called Sunniva Caffe.
This summer, Baxter worked with Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) to successfully draft and introduce legislation designating June as National Gun Violence Awareness Month.
He has also worked in a variety of D.C. youth programs, including the After School Kids Program, the Sursum Corda Tutoring Program, Childfund International and the Special Olympic World Games in Los Angeles, Calif.

Margot Keale (NHS ’16)
Keale is a senior in the School of Nursing and Health Studies studying health care management and policy with minors in government and art history.
On campus, Keale serves as a co-chair of NHS Academic Council and vice-president of the Georgetown University Academic Health Chapter. She is also an NHS peer advisor.
Her talk will address the personal risk she took in coming to Georgetown two years after an autoimmune disease left her paralyzed from the chest down.
“I’ve come to realize that when we don’t admit the risks we take we can’t fully celebrate the moment when we overcome them,” Keale wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I’ll be sharing my story in hopes that others feel empowered to reflect upon challenges they face and then celebrate the fact that they’re working through them.”
Keale said that she has been hesitant to share her story and detail the struggles she faced when she left her support system at home to begin life on the Hilltop.
“Even still today, saying this leaves me feeling vulnerable, and I don’t want anyone to know that I at times I have struggled,” Keale wrote.
Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16) & Patrick Lim (SFS ’16)
Jatovsky and Lim, both international politics majors in the School of Foreign Service, will give a joint talk about the Syrian refugee crisis through the perspective of their friend, Sami, who won a scholarship opportunity to study in Canada after living in the Zaatari refugee camp for three years.
“We met Sami last year when studying abroad in Jordan,” Jatovsky wrote in an email to The Hoya. “In giving this talk, we hope to raise awareness of an issue that becomes all the more pressing by the day.”
Jatovsky, who speaks Hebrew and Arabic, has lived in both Israel and Jordan. His regional focus is on the Middle East, particularly the Arab-Israeli conflict.
He co-founded J Street U Georgetown, an advocacy group, and collaborated with Lim to help start the Foundation for the Advancement of Refugee Education. He is a peer advisor in the Office of Global Education and a Bunker fellow in Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.
On campus, Lim is involved with the Brilliantly British Club and writes for the U.S. Middle East Youth Network. He has also served on the Diplomatic Ball committee.
Scott Dennis (COL ’16)
Dennis is a senior in the College studying government and philosophy.
In his TEDx talk, he will address the work that the university has done on the issue of mental health.
“I wanted to express to people that taking a risk and opening up about their mental health is a vital part to the recovery process for the entire Georgetown community,” Dennis wrote in an email to The Hoya.
“Being an active participant in these conversations is about more than sharing a story, it’s also about others hearing that story,” Dennis wrote.
On campus, he is most involved with Active Minds, a group that strives to promote positive conversations surrounding topics of mental health and mental wellness.
He is also involved with the Students of Georgetown, Inc.’s Philanthropy Committee, which redistributes the profits of The Corp back into the student body in the form of grants and scholarships. Outside of Georgetown, he is an AmeriCorps member, a position through which he participated in a variety of governmental projects.
After graduation, he hopes to go on to a career in public service and further pursue his current interests on campus.

Professor of Middle East Studies at Sciences Po, Paris School of International Affairs Jean-Pierre Filiu stressed necessary measures that both Palestinians and Israelis should take in order to pacify current regional tensions at an event in the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies Boardroom Jan. 15. The lecture, which was hosted by the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies, focused on the recent escalation of tension and violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Tel Aviv.
Filiu, who previously held visiting professorships at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, has written 10 books and served as a diplomatic advisor for various French government offices.
Filiu’s remarks centered on the ongoing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians that intensified in the summer of 2014 when Hamas soldiers from the Gaza Strip exchanged rocket fire with Israeli military forces stationed at the border. According to Filiu, the recent conflict was the most devastating to the Gaza Strip and its residents, but it was neither unexpected nor unprecedented.
“On this very Friday, two Palestinian young adults were shot dead at the so-called ‘border’ between the Gaza Strip and Israel,” Filiu said. “According to the Israeli military sources they were provoking the Israeli military. This has become the new normal. … This is absolutely tragic.”
Filiu opened his remarks by saying that in order for one to understand how to resolve the current conflict — especially in the Gaza Strip — observers must understand the history of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that has led up to this most recent confrontation.
“Gaza has been under this terrible military pressure from day one,” Filiu said. “[Gaza] is what is left once everything else has been taken.”
Filiu said that Israel has engaged in twelve wars against militants in the Gaza Strip, including the conflict in the summer of 2014.
“The Gaza Strip has been created through war, when the state of Israel was created, but Gaza was an oasis. It was a place where people met and traded,” Filiu said. “That was the whole function of Gaza for millennia.”
Filiu said that the effects of Israel’s violent exchanges with Gaza have converted the historically diverse and fertile region into a prison.
“It is the greatest open-air prison in the world, which is not an analogy I fully support, because I do not know many prisons when, during moments of riots, the wardens routinely shoot at the inmates,” Filiu said. “This is the case in Gaza.”
Filiu then traced the history of Gaza-Israel conflicts, including the context surrounding the creation of the Israeli state and the absorption of formerly Palestinian-claimed lands. Among the conflicts, he cited the first and second intifadas as the seventh and eighth wars respectively, and highlighted the implementation of the policies of closure after the first intifada.
Filiu also discussed a concept he coined ‘lawn mowing,’ an effort by Israel to occasionally intervene in Gaza to stifle resistance, as an embodiment of the decades of violence and tension.
The turning point in the ongoing conflict, according to Filiu, was in June 2007, when Hamas won legislative elections in Gaza. After the election, Israel declared Gaza a hostile entity and tensions have only risen since.
“Since then, no Israeli has entered Gaza, except in a tank,” Filiu said. “This means the people of Gaza only know Israelis for the wrong things — the killings.”
Filiu said there is a realistic possibility of Palestinian nationalist movements cooperating with the Islamic State group and Egyptian insurgents, potentially dragging Egypt into war and forcing Israel to intervene in the Sinai Peninsula.
“Israel going into Sinai would mean the end of the Camp David agreement,” Filiu said. “I would not like to live in that world.”
Filiu recommended an immediate and unconditional lifting of the blockade on the Gaza Strip, both on the mainland and in the sea. A major point of contention between Palestinians and Israel has been an enforced fishing zone that limits the waters where fishermen can cast their nets.
“It is not something you do because you are nice. It is something you have to do to avoid catastrophe,” Filiu said. “The border should be opened tomorrow and a sea line opened at least to Cyprus.”
During the question-and-answer session following his address, Filiu expressed his support for a two-state solution.
“Palestinians need a flag and a passport. A two-state solution is the only way out and it is not an illusion,” Filiu said. “You don’t change the word ‘war’ because of casualties. War is war.”
Filiu said that he believes the next war between Israel and Palestinians will be far worse, just as each previous war has been worse than the one preceding.
“These people don’t need help,” he said. “They need freedom.”
Ari Shapiro (SFS ’18) said that Filiu’s remarks on the conflict’s background were insightful and informative, but he did not agree with some definitions and personal arguments.
“I generally really appreciated what the professor said about the issues and the history,” Shapiro said. “I disagree with his definitions of war and his definitions of Israeli wars.”
Elizabeth Bujwid (SFS ’18), who asked about the role the United States would play in facilitating dialogue between the two entities, said she enjoyed the discussion, finding Filiu’s critiques and observations on the ongoing dialogue welcome.
“It was really important to hear from an independent observer,” Bujwid said.

Georgetown University will launch the Center for Jewish Civilization, an interdisciplinary teaching and research program that will cover all aspects of Jewish civilization, with an event Monday.
The center, which will replace the Program for Jewish Civilization, is the result of almost 12 years of work by university administrators, faculty and donors.
As part of the School of Foreign Service, the center will push forward plans to create a major and a Master of Arts degree in Jewish civilization. The center will focus on a wide range of subjects, including American foreign policy toward the Middle East and Jewish literature and culture.
The formal launch event Monday night will include a keynote address by Rev. Patrick Desbois, president of Yahad-In Unum and director of the Service for Relations with Judaism in the Catholic Bishops’ Conference, University President John J. DeGioia and SFS Dean Joel Hellman.
The center has also hosted a series of events in the run-up to its launch, including an all-day conference Feb. 29 about anti-Semitism. Representatives of the U.S Department of State, as well as area experts from France, Poland, Scandinavia and Holland, will attend the launch.
The Program for Jewish Civilization was originally launched in September 2003 under the leadership of Rabbi Harold White and sought to promote an increased understanding of Jewish civilization at the university.
Rabbi Rachel Gartner said the center will showcase the importance of Jewish life at Georgetown.
“We at Georgetown have a great story to tell about Jewish life. Jewish life and academics have been thriving at Georgetown for a good long time. The Center of Civilization represents a coming to fruition of years of excitement and offers us an incredible opportunity in a big way to tell the story of Jewish life here,” Gartner said.
Gartner also said the center will satisfy a desire for increased education in Jewish civilization at Georgetown.
“From my perspective as the rabbi on this campus, I can say that there is a thirst for more Jewish knowledge in our Jewish student community, and there is an interest in learning about Judaism among students from other backgrounds as well,” Gartner said.
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18), who is a member of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, wrote in an email to The Hoya that he hopes the CJC will promote Jewish life for all students.
“I think that the launching of the CJC will promote Jewish life on campus for both Jews and non-Jews,” Shinbrot wrote. “At a school like Georgetown, I think that offering students a way to learn about Judaism, anti-Semitism, the holocaust, and Israel (although the holocaust and Israel can be seen in a “non-Jewish context”) is the best way to promote Jewish life and allow students to engage in Semitic studies.”
A full article on the center’s launch will be covered in a future issue of The Hoya. Hoya Staff Writer Jesse Jacobs contributed reporting.

Boosted by a $10 million donation from the Braman family, Georgetown University officially launched the Center for Jewish Civilization, announced by University President John J. DeGioia in a campus-wide email Wednesday.
The CJC serves as an interdisciplinary teaching and research unit within the School of Foreign Service, with a focus on Jewish history, culture and civilization. The center will replace the Program for Jewish Civilization, which was originally launched in September 2003 under the leadership of Rabbi Harold White in an effort to promote an increased understanding of Jewish civilization at the university.
CJC Director Jacques Berlinerblau, who previously led the PJC, said the center will act to facilitate the study of Jewish civilization on campus.
“We see ourselves as a hub. We want to encourage and make possible the study of Judaism on the Georgetown campus, and we view ourselves almost as like the convener,” Berlinerblau said.
The center is the result of 12 years of a fundraising effort by Georgetown faculty and administrators, in which the university raised almost $11 million in endowed funds for the center from more than 500 families, and another $10 million from the Braman family to establish the Braman Endowed Professorship of the Practice of the Forensic Study of the Holocaust, a new position within the center that will be filled by Rev. Patrick Desbois, previously an adjunct professor.
The Braman family is personally connected to the study of Jewish civilization and the Holocaust, as donor Norman Braman of Miami, Fla., is the son of Holocaust survivors.
“I have decided to make this gift, now, and to Georgetown, in part as a sign of my appreciation for the leadership of Pope Francis and the priority he so clearly attaches to fostering closer relations between
Jews and Catholics,” Braman wrote in a statement to The Washington Post.
The center will primarily focus on American-Middle Eastern foreign policy as it pertains to Israel, the Holocaust and genocide and Jewish literature.
According to Berlinerblau, the focus on American-Middle Eastern foreign policy is a result of the center’s setup in the SFS.
“The first initiative, because we were in the SFS, is we wanted to become the pre-eminent school in the world that studied American-Middle Eastern foreign policy as it pertained to Israel,” Berlinerblau said. “And that of course implies that we have to also know about energy policy, oil prices, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, that’s all enfolded within Middle Eastern geopolitics.”
Berlinerblau said the university has made strides in the field of Middle Eastern studies in recent years by hiring professors such as Ambassador Dennis Ross, former Deputy National Security Advisor Elliott Abrams and Michael Oren before he became Israeli ambassador to the United States.
The center will focus heavily on research into the Holocaust, in part through the work of Desbois, according to Vice President for Advancement Bart Moore.
“It’s based on Fr. Desbois’ groundbreaking research that has established the full extent and murderous impact the Nazi’s ruthlessly effective mobile killing squad that was used in East-Central and East Europe to kill previously uncounted tens of thousands of people, in places where they did not have established concentration camps,” Moore said.
Berlinerblau said the CJC will provide a center for the experience of Jewish culture and Judaism’s role in Georgetown’s campus life.
“I would say there was a perception in the Jewish community prior to Jack DeGioia creating the CJC that Georgetown was at best indifferent and at worst not really interested at all in Jewish civilization, and whether it was right or wrong, that perception existed,” Berlinerblau said. “Well that perception doesn’t exist anymore, because everyone sees Georgetown as a friend, as an asset, as a neighbor and everything is good here.”
Moore said it has always been important to the university to increase education about Judaism.
“Fr. Healy often spoke publicly about the importance of any great university knowing and teaching the intellectual, religious and cultural traditions of the Jewish people, and I think it was, in part, a desire to complete a project initiated by Fr. Healy that this became so important to President DeGioia,” Moore said.
Berlinerblau said establishing the CJC helps ensure that the center’s work is on an equal and long-lasting footing.
“But also there is a solidity, a perpetuity, since this is $21 million of endowed money, we now know that we’re around forever,” Berlinerblau said.
According to Berlinerblau, the CJC also hopes to establish a major and master — a major in the college in Jewish civilization and a master’s program in Holocaust studies — at the university. Berlinerblau said a master’s program could be formed in two years, while the CJC is ready to move ahead with developing a major this year once it receives approval from the administration.
“We’re locked, ready, loaded and ready to go, and we need to see if we get pushback, but generally Georgetown is good with these things so I would hope that by the end of this semester we have a signal from Chet that this is something he wants to explore,” Berlinerblau said.
Moore said donors appreciated Georgetown’s commitment to Judaism.
“I think there’s a great appreciation for the respect that the university is paying to the Jewish people and their history and culture and tradition and religion by making it a priority in President DeGioia’s presidency that we have a properly funded, permanently endowed center dedicated to Jewish studies,” Moore said.
John Davison (GSB ’87), who donated to help establish the PJC in 2003 and then the CJC, said the reasons behind his donations have changed over the past 12 years.
“I feel like I’m no longer giving to something to alleviate a problem, I’m giving to something to make the center more substantial and to attract greater teaching talent, would be how my perspective has changed,” Davison said.
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner added that there is a significant level of interest for Jewish education on campus.
“From my perspective as the rabbi on this campus, I can say that there is a thirst for more Jewish knowledge in our Jewish student community and there is an interest in learning about Judaism among students from other backgrounds as well,” Gartner said. “So I think this center serves a need and will be met with terrific enthusiasm among the students.”
Professor Ori Soltes said he was excited about the prospect of expanding the understanding of Jewish civilization at a Catholic university.
“All those kinds of cross-communications that the greater visibility will hopefully make it even more effective as an instrument to serve that purpose, from at least the angle of Judaism and its relation to Catholicism, Christianity at large, Islam and what have you,” Soltes said.
Maddy Budman (COL ’18), a GUish intern at Georgetown University Campus Ministry, wrote in an email to The Hoya that she hopes the center will help advance the curriculum relating to Jewish studies.
“I hope that the center launch will bring more attention to the CJC, leading us to things like a better physical office space and more administrative support,” Budman wrote. “I’ve seen a shift recently in the PJC from purely Israel-Palestine and Holocaust classes to literature and theology and more creative humanities classes, and I think that the center launch will help encourage the continuing of this diversity in curriculum.”
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18), who is a member of the Georgetown Israel Alliance and Alpha Epsilon Pi, wrote in an email to The Hoya that he is also excited for the center.
“I think that the launching of the CJC will promote Jewish life on campus for both Jews and non-Jews. At a school like Georgetown, I think that offering students a way to learn about Judaism, anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, and Israel (although the Holocaust and Israel can be seen in a “non-Jewish context”) is the best way to promote Jewish life and allow students to engage in Semitic studies,” Shinbrot wrote.

Georgetown University Medical Center researchers introduced a possible anti-cancer therapy in the form of two drugs sourced from the plant hormone strigolactone in a study published Feb. 16.
The two drugs have been found to cause DNA breakage and turn off a major DNA repair mechanism in cancer cells, thereby inhibiting the ability of more aggressive cancers to repair themselves once damaged.
The synthetic plant compounds, also known as MEB55 and ST362, have only recently been introduced into the realm of human health. Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center researcher and professor Ronit Yarden, along with a team of researchers, was the first to publish the role of strigolactones in mammalian rather than plant cells.
The team included researchers from Georgetown, the Agricultural Research Organization in Israel, the University of Turin in Italy, the National Cancer Institute and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
In a previous study, Yarden and her team reported that strigolactones induce apoptosis, or programmed cell death, and cell cycle arrest. In this most recent study, Yarden and her team investigated the processes by which these agents cause cell death.
Cancer cells rely heavily on DNA repair mechanisms, which are necessary for cell survival. The two hormones studied were found to trigger a DNA damage-like response.
According to Preclinical Imaging Research Laboratory Director and founder Christopher Albanese, specific pressures are too much for cancer cells to handle, which leads to damaged DNA. Once DNA becomes damaged beyond repair, the cell will die.
“Cancer cells are very smart, smarter than us. Certain stresses, though, are too much for them to handle, like damaged DNA,” Albanese said. “The hormones in the study induced a DNA damage-like response, which leads to inevitable cell death mode. The hope is that cancer will be become much more manageable.”
The researchers found that strigolactones halt the DNA repair process after the cell’s DNA is copied and before it divides. However, even if one repair mechanism is shut down, the cancer cells have the capacity to rely on a second repair mechanism and still survive.
The team is currently experimenting with the compound in mice studies. If the mice studies are successful, the drug will move to a phased clinical trial. The researchers hope to eventually begin testing on humans, and ultimately receive a drug company investment in their compound.
Yarden said she conceived the idea of using plant compounds to combat cancer cells in an unconventional way.
“It was very random. I have a friend, who is now my collaborator, and she is a molecular biologist but of plants. We discussed our research at a social event and she told me she was working with those compounds and that they have some properties that inhibit cell cycle and stem cells in plants,” Yarden said. “It was a long shot, a very long shot. We thought that if they inhibit stem cells in plants, maybe these universal systems would also be applicable for cancer cells.”
Though the study initially focused on breast cancer, Yarden said she soon realized the compounds could battle other types of cancers as well.
“We started with breast cancer because that was my main research before this project, but now we have tested many different cancer cell lines and we know that it’s effective toward prostate, lung and color cancer cell lines,” Yarden said. “In both prostate and breast cancer we noticed that it’s very effective toward the more aggressive types of cancer cells.”
Albanese said the hope is if these drugs are applied to humans, the same therapeutic activity will occur.
Albanese highlighted the important role of drug companies in drug research, saying that corporations are primarily interested in investing in certain drugs that will have large payoffs.
“Drug companies need to see that the drugs in vivo work with the same mechanisms as in cell culture,” Albanese said. “In order to get a drug to market, you need money and interest. Drug companies are looking for blockbuster drugs to pay for expenses.”
Albanese added that the drugs are a long way from going on the market, in part because of the high costs of putting a drug through the process of obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.
“The failure rates are huge, the costs are even more huge,” Albanese said. “It takes up to one billion dollars to get from the stage we are at now to FDA approval.”
The research primarily focused on breast cancer, but the team also tested many different cell lines, including prostate and colon cancer cells. In prostate and breast cancer, the drugs were more effective against the more aggressive types of cancer cells.
Yarden stressed that because the drug is in such an early stage, the researchers cannot guarantee the drug’s ability to fully treat cancer.
“It’s a long way. We just started the studies in May,” Yarden said. “It’s just such an early phase.”
Jefferson Haake (NHS ’16), one of the primary researchers published in the study, said that despite the strigolatones’ aggression toward cancer cells, they do not harm normal cells, which is a problem often associated with chemotherapy treatments. Haake added that the lack of damage inflicted on normal cells could alleviate the side effects that typically accompany anti-cancer therapeutic treatments. This would allow a higher dosage of drugs in chemotherapeutic regimens and enable a more aggressive attack on the cancer cells.
“The two main takeaways from this study for the educated layperson are that, the compound is something that is toxic toward cancer but not to, as far as we know, non-cancer cells,” Haake said. “You are actually killing the cancer as opposed to getting your own cells caught in the crossfire. That’s a big issue with chemotherapy today, is that you are essentially pumping someone full of toxins and hoping that it takes the cancer faster than it takes the person.”

Former Anti-Defamation League National Director and Holocaust survivor Abraham Foxman characterized the global status of anti-Semitism today as more dire than at any point since World War II during a lecture delivered in the Copley Formal Lounge on Feb. 23.
The event, titled “Reflections on Recent Anti-Semitism,” addressed topics ranging from attitudes toward Jews in the Middle East to anti-Israel demonstrations on college campuses.
Foxman specifically highlighted protests ahead of the formal launch of the new Center for Jewish Civilization and Georgetown’s Conference on Understanding Contemporary European Anti-Semitism, which both occurred Feb. 22.
Foxman, who was born in Poland in 1940 and survived the annihilation of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, prefaced his remarks by cautioning against the rise of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who holds the highest poll numbers in the GOP election despite divisive comments about banning Muslims and deporting illegal immigrants.
“Mr. Trump comes in and breaks all the taboos about what is a civil compact in our society, that unwritten code of what is acceptable and what is not,” Foxman said. “When we watch every single day another taboo broken, and people hesitant to challenge that breaking of the taboo, it is beginning to undermine everything the common sense and respect that has served us and other minorities well.”
Following his comments on the political situation in America, Foxman contrasted the plight of Jews in the United States and Europe. He claimed that contemporary European Jews are confronted with lamentable situations in their home countries: They are faced with violence as well as discriminatory legislation that targets practices such as circumcision and kosher slaughtering.
“If Jews leave Europe because they cannot live there as Jews, because authorities send messages that ‘we don’t want you,’ because authorities say ‘yeah, you can stay but not as a Jew,’ they’re left with this haunting problem of whether or not to stay,” Foxman said. “And if they don’t stay, Hitler will have a posthumous victory.”
Foxman cited evidence compiled by the Anti-Defamation League over the past two years in a poll gauging levels of anti-Semitism in over 100 countries. The survey identified respondents to harbor anti-Semitic attitudes if they answered “true” to six or more of 11 statements describing negative Jewish stereotypes.
The ADL found that 26 percent of approximately 4.2 billion adults surveyed harbored anti-Semitic attitudes, with the highest averages in the Middle East and North Africa region at 74 percent.
Using the ADL data, Foxman said Jews in the United States are 10 times more likely to be targeted than any other religious group.
“Measuring anti-Semitism is not scientific, but if it acts like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it’s a duck,” Foxman said. “To find that a quarter of the adult population of the world is infected with serious anti-Semitism, and that the number one thing is that Jews cannot be trusted, that’s just very serious.”
As a staunch advocate for Israel, Foxman pronounced most criticism against Zionism to be rooted in anti-Semitism. He asserted that Israel is subjected to a double standard and unfairly chastised for acting in ways that other countries can with impunity.
“Israel is far from perfect. What other country in the world cannot decide where its capital is? Is there another country in the world that has to defend its right to defend itself?” Foxman said. “If you’re anti-Zionist, the only way you’re not an anti-Semite is if they are one of the unique ones in the world who reject all nationalism.”
Foxman said that anti-Zionist attitudes are increasingly evident on college campuses such as Vassar, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Stanford. He explained that pro-Palestinian demonstrations in those schools may result in hostile climates for Jewish students. In January 2016, students at Wisconsin taped paper swastikas and a picture of Adolf Hitler on a Jewish student’s dorm room door.
“It never starts as anti-Semitism,” Foxman said. “It begins as advocacy and morphs and metastasizes very quickly into anti-Semitism. In these demonstrations by students for Palestine where they place eviction notices on students’ doors to symbolize Palestinians being evicted, they post it on the Cohens’, the Greenbergs’, the Goldsteins’ dorms.”
Following his address, Foxman answered questions from the audience about topics such as Jewish attitudes to the Syrian refugee crisis, the condition of Jews in Ireland and the implications of Jewish migration from Europe.
Annabelle Timsit (SFS ’17), who attended the event, said Foxman’s lecture reflected the rampant anti-Semitism she witnessed while growing up and attending public school in France.
“I was very much impacted in class when we talked about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and I heard some very anti-Semitic remarks from students in class,” Timsit said. “Even teachers said, not knowing I was Jewish, ‘Oh, but it’s expected, because these are Jews and they come in and they take over and become more powerful than anybody else’ or, ‘Well, something would have been done about this a long time ago except Jews have control of politics in France.’”
Retired U.S. Foreign Service Officer Ilya Levin, who also attended the event, noted how, during years of service abroad, he found post-World War II Europe riddled with subtle anti-Semitism.
“I went to a country, and they started a center of Jewish tolerance,” Levin said. “I told the director, as a naturalized American and a Jew, the name sounded kind of wrong. You tolerate an unwanted guest. You do not have to ‘tolerate’ someone who is part of your family. It’s the sort of thing here, in America, we take for granted.”
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18) said certain aspects of the lecture rang more true than others.
“I’ve definitely witnessed anti-Zionism on campus, and obviously Georgetown is inherently political, and these are conversations that need to be had, but holding Israel to a different standard, I agree that is anti-Semitism,” Shinbrot said. “But something that is troubling for me to believe is that if Europe’s Jews have to leave, that is another victory for Hitler. That is very tough for me to hear, and I’m not sure I believe that completely.”

Tensions flared among student groups invested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after the vandalism of a makeshift wall created by Georgetown’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine in the Intercultural Center Galleria on March 14.
The wall was put up during Israeli Apartheid Week, which is held in over 150 universities worldwide, and aimed at symbolizing the Israeli West Bank barrier while spotlighting alleged injustices associated with the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza strip.
In addition to the wall, SJP’s programming included events such as a “Faith Washing,” which combatted the view of the conflict as a religious issue, and a discussion on why the SJP uses the term “apartheid” to characterize Israeli settlement.
The defacement included marker etchings and messages over the newspaper clippings, flyers, statistics and photographs pinned to the wall, which was taken down Sunday. The perpetrators of the vandalism have not been identified as of press time. One featured the wall’s title scribbled over and replaced with “International Anti-Israel Week 2016.” Another message invoked a quote by former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, stating, “Peace will come when Arabs love their children more than they hate Jews.”
SJP Chair Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17) said she found the messages to be anti-Arab and verging on Islamophobic.
“We were shocked,” Abdelfadeel said. “This is a big issue — it’s bigger than any of us. We’ve done it multiple times in the past and on an annual basis, and we’ve heard from people but no one has ever gone so far as to vandalize our wall.”
The Georgetown University Police Department dispatched a criminal investigation unit to interview affiliated students, witnesses and suspects of the vandalism. GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said apprehended suspects could face criminal charges relating to property destruction and a referral to the Office of Student Conduct.
“Georgetown University is a place where this kind of activity really isn’t tolerated,” Gruber said. “We’re supposed to be a place where you’re allowed to express your feelings or your thoughts without somebody coming up and causing damage to that, so hopefully this was just an isolated incident.”
Assistant Director of Student Engagement Lauren Gagliardi spoke on behalf of the Center for Student Engagement and offered its support to the SJP following the vandalism.
“The university considers acts of hate and bias unacceptable and antithetical to its commitment to an inclusive and respectful community,” Gagliardi wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Georgetown Israel Alliance and J Street U Georgetown, both pro-Israel organizations, have condemned the vandalism of the SJP’s wall.
GIA President Daniel Silbert (COL ’18) said he found SJP’s display one-sided and divisive but emphasized that the GIA would never respond to provocative displays with vandalism.
“If I come face-to-face with whoever did this, I’d say what you did was wrong because you defaced another campus organization’s property, which is against campus rules. It’s disrespectful, but even furthermore, it’s a horrible representation of the pro-Israel community,” Silbert said. “That’s not what we stand for, and if you are upset by what’s being said on that wall, when you respond by writing on it and defacing it, you’re just bringing more attention to it and giving their baseless claims even more attention.”
Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16), former co-chair and current treasurer of J Street, attributed the politically charged use of the term “apartheid” as fueling the tensions that resulted in the wall’s vandalism.
“One of my main oppositions to it is that it suggests Israel is this horrible apartheid state when there is a huge difference between Israel proper and the occupied territories of the West Bank. I just think glossing over it with one word removes all nuance from the conversation and is also just very inflammatory for everyone,” Wartenberg said.
SJP member Matt Martin (COL ’16) said the term aptly calls attention to the parallels between the colonial oppression of black South Africans and Palestinians.
“Apartheid is an Afrikaans word meaning ‘separateness,’ and that is exactly what is in Israel-Palestine today — separateness,” Martin said. “It’s explicit, and it’s in their laws that are often very discriminatory against Palestinians and all sort of things. It doesn’t seek to equate Israel with apartheid South Africa but to highlight similarities and to then provoke conversation and critical thinking.”
In response to Israel Apartheid Week, the GIA launched a campaign calling for increased dialogue with members of the SJP. Silbert argued the SJP’s anti-normalization policy, which argues that debates between the two sides should be resisted because the process legitimizes pro-Israel positions, has stifled dialogue.
“If their goal is to promote peace and a solution to the conflict in Israel, not talking to the other side, and saying you’re not going to talk to the other side, is never going to move towards peace. It’s just going to alienate people away from your cause,” Silbert said.
Abdelfadeel said the anti-normalization policy is rooted in the philosophical principle that pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian positions are not morally equivalent sides.
“Israel has exercised settler-colonial policies against the Palestinians who have suffered immensely under this, and we don’t think it’s fair and it’s actually really, really absurd for anyone to suggest that an occupied people negotiate or talk or dialogue with the occupier,” Abdelfadeel said.
In light of Israel Apartheid Week and the vandalism, Martin criticized the university’s response to the vandalism, claiming its lack of formal statement is an unwelcome sign of how seriously it considers the rights of student groups.
“I anticipate and hope that the university will be more outspoken about vandalism on campus and take the rights of student groups seriously no matter what views they represent,” Martin said.

Approximately 30 Georgetown University Fossil Free members and supporters gathered to demand socially responsible investments and more transparency from the board of directors’ Socially Responsible Investments Committee — including restricting investments in gun manufacturing and fossil fuel companies — at a rally hosted by GUFF in Red Square on Wednesday.
The rally, which was titled “Follow the Money” and previewed by an event page and introductory video on Facebook, was co-sponsored by 10 student organizations, including Georgetown Against Gun Violence, Georgetown University Amnesty International, H*yas for Choice, Georgetown Israel Alliance, Georgetown Refugee Action, Georgetown Secular Student Alliance, Georgetown Solidarity Committee and Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine.
Members of GUFF, accompanied by a group of protestors, met after the protest with Chief of Staff of the Office of the President Joe Ferrara and Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson to deliver a list of written demands.
The protestors’ requests primarily included the creation and development of a university-wide socially responsible investment policy, which would include a public list of companies and industries the university should refrain from investing in based on its core Jesuit values.
After action by GUFF, the university voted to cease direct investment in coal companies in June 2015, and currently does not provide a public list of energy companies in its endowment.
Additionally, GUFF requested that the university reconstruct the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility and institute an additional institute an additional board of directors working group to uphold the policy and include students in the process.
Protestors are also seeking the development by the university of an investment transparency website to publicly disclose any connections between Georgetown’s investments and personal connections within the board of directors or other major donors.
According to GUFF member Caroline James (COL ’16), the purpose of the rally was to raise awareness for the lack of clear and public university policy on investment.
“We’ve had a lot of frustration with the university bureaucracy and basically finding that there isn’t a university-wide policy about what we will and will not invest in,” James said. “So we decided to have a ‘follow-the-money’ rally to show that other groups have a vested interest in seeing the university have this policy.”
According to a statement issued by Ferrara following the rally, the board of directors will review the list of demands.
“We will share the demands with the board of directors committee that is reviewing socially responsible investing,” Ferrara wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
GUFF member Grady Willard (SFS ’18), who attended the meeting, said the group’s conversation with Ferrara was a step in the right direction, but hopes the administration will continue to be receptive to students’ demands in order for progress to be made.
“I thought it was a very effective meeting. We elaborated on our demands and engaged in a discussion of topics related to student engagement, socially responsible investment, board transparency, and CISR reform,” Willard said. “We feel like both of them were very receptive to our overall argument, and look forward to engaging more with them and the board of directors in the future.”
Aaron Bennett (COL ’19), who attended the rally, said the protestors’ messages and demands for change were moving.
“I think it’s great that Georgetown students are deciding to speak out against some of the lack of transparency and socially irresponsible funding on behalf of Georgetown University,” Bennett said.
GUFF member Brendan Stelmach (SFS ’19) said the demands are essential to better align the university’s policies with Jesuit values, and hopes the university will more carefully consider the ways it utilizes its endowment in the future.
“One of the most meaningful ways that, as students, we can show our support for protection against climate change is by campaigning to change how we invest our endowment,” Stelmach said. “It’s a direct representation of us as students and I think that by putting some of these changes in place we can move towards being more representative of what Georgetown is truly about.”

Israeli citizens Khaled Farrag and Yasmin Yablonko defended their refusal to serve in the Israel Defense Forces because of the Israeli government’s treatment of the Druze and Palestinian communities during an event in White-Gravenor on Monday, April 18.
The event, which was sponsored by J Street Georgetown, featured Farrag, a 34-year-old Palestinian Druze and Israeli citizen, and Yablonko, a 23-year-old Israeli, who both refused to serve in the Israel Defense Forces because of their ideological objections.
The Druze is a religious minority found mostly in Syria, Lebanon and Israel. Originated from Islam in the 11th Century, the Druze today is considered an independent religion. The Druze is the only Palestinian community required by law to serve in the Israeli army.
All other non-Arab Israeli citizens are required to serve in the military after turning 18.
Historically, refusing military service has been one of the most prevalent ways that Israelis resist occupation from within. As a result, in spite of ‘compulsory’ conscription, less than 50 percent of Israelis and 64 percent of the Jewish-Israeli population serve in the IDF. Approximately 75 percent of the Israeli population identifies as Jewish and 21 percent identifies as Arab.
While both Farrag and Yablonko have focused on helping other youth follow in their footsteps by partnering with various organizations, their efforts primarily go toward aiding Israeli Jews and the Druze.
Through her work with Mesarvot, a network of Israeli organizations resisting occupation, Yablonko aims to offer young Jewish citizens assistance and help them organize their own efforts to refuse to serve. Farrag’s movement, Urfod, asks Israel to end compulsory military service for Druze.
According to Farrag, Israel uses the education system to isolate the Druze and pressure them to join the military. The curricula and the content in the Druze schools aim to erase any rebellious qualities in the Druze communities.
“I think the most dangerous tool they used was imposed in the 1970’s where total separation of the educational systems was done for the Druze,” Farrag said. “They created a Druze curriculum which means that the content they taught in schools that have a majority of Druze was just different from any other Arab school. This is the most dangerous one because this is the one that actually works.”
Yablonko agreed with Farrag’s assessment of the education system as perpetuating the illusion that everyone enlists and increasing social pressure to join the military.
“It seems to everyone in Israel ,and I think also outside of it, that everyone is going to the military in Israel. The truth is it’s not like that, and I think that the right question to ask is ‘how come that’s the situation; how come everyone thinks that the military’s obviously something you have to do?’” Yablonko said. “I think that the major answer to that would be the education system.”
According to Yablonko, in Israel the pressure to become a soldier starts as early as kindergarten. Then, in tenth grade, students are ordered to come to the military and start testing. The whole education system is geared toward helping students determine which job in the military they will get.
“There is no question about will I go, just what will I do there?” Yablonko said.
Beyond preparation in school, the immense social stigma imposed on those who refuse ensures that young Israelis enlist in the military.
“When you’re seventeen, eighteen years old and all your friends are going and doing something, it’s really hard not to do it, especially when this something is so obviously the next thing you should do,” Yablonko said.
According to Yablonko, pressure to join the military not only comes from peers but also from parents.
As a result, according to Farrag, many Druze today serving in the IDF no longer connect to their Palestinian or Arab identity. Farrag said he hopes the Ufrod movement, which advocates eliminating conscription for Druze, will work to connect the Druze men refusing military conscription with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, two historically-linked groups.
“When [Palestinians] see a Druze who’s not a soldier first of all and then talks just like they do and is part of the Palestinian struggle for liberation, they are very inspired and happy to know that there are other voices,” Farrag said.

Georgetown is among 18 institutions awarded a $28 million grant from the National Institute of Health for the BELIEVE project, an effort led by researchers from The George Washington University to discover a cure for HIV/AIDS.
With funding from the NIH’s Martin Delaney Collaboratory grant, researchers will develop a cell therapy approach designed to improve the immune system’s ability to eliminate HIV reservoirs in individuals with HIV.
The BELIEVE project, or Bench to Bed Enhanced Lymphocyte Infusions to Engineer Viral Eradication, is a joint program involving 18 medical centers spanning across the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil.
American institutions collaborating on the project include Johns Hopkins University, the Children’s National Health System, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania. Internationally, the project involves researchers at the University of Toronto, Centro de Investigación en Enfermedades Infecciosas in Mexico and the University of Sao Paulo.
Georgetown University Medical Center Senior Associate Dean for Students Princy Kumar will lead Georgetown’s arm of the project. Kumar was unavailable to comment at press time.
In April 2015, NIH awarded Georgetown University, along with George Washington University, Howard University, American University, the Children’s National Medical Center and the Washington DC VA Medical Center, a $7.5 million grant to set up the District of Columbia Center for AIDS Research.
The lead investigators from DC CFAR, including Kumar, are spearheading BELIEVE.
Brad Jones, an assistant professor of microbiology, immunology and tropical medicine at GWU School of Medicine and Health Sciences, said the project’s goal is to eliminate viral reservoirs.
“Curing HIV infection will likely require eliminating all virus in all of the sites that it persists, a daunting task,” Jones wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our goal is that at the end of this five-year period we will have a clear indication that we have achieved reductions of viral reservoirs in clinical trial participants and knowledge on how to improve upon this initial success to cure individuals in future iterations of this trial.”
Jones emphasized the need for local action, as Washington, D.C., plays an important role in the HIV epidemic with an infection rate of 3.2 percent.
“It is critical that the local academic institutions partner with each other, with community stakeholders, and with industry partners and work together to help curb the epidemic locally, nationally, and around the world,” Jones wrote.
The program will establish community advisory boards, annual meetings between institutions, educational outreach and other frameworks to ensure successful cooperation on the transnational project. The District of Columbia Center for AIDS Research will further provide access to laboratories, study design services and access to clinical populations.
Alan Greenberg, director of the District of Columbia Center for AIDS Research, stressed his team’s dedication to full collaboration with other key institutions in both BELIEVE and DC CFAR.
“[We] will work in close collaboration to ensure that there is maximum synergy between these two NIH funded projects,” Greenberg wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Manya Magnus, an associate professor of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at GWU’s Milken Institute School of Public Health who also serves as associate chair of the department, underscored the need for local outreach in both the medical and general community.
“It is critical that local and global communities are thoroughly engaged in all facets of HIV cure research. In addition to developing structures for ongoing and meaningful community input into both basic science and our novel clinical trials, we will together with members of the community develop and implement innovative educational outreach strategies about HIV cure research,” Magnus wrote in an email to The Hoya.
As a member of BELIEVE’s executive committee, Jones expressed his optimism toward the project and the BELIEVE team’s vested responsibility to work toward a cure for HIV.
“We are all excited and grateful for this opportunity to work together. My personal feelings are dominated by a sense of responsibility. We’ve been handed an opportunity to move the world closer to a cure for HIV/AIDS and we are committed to delivering on this,” Jones wrote.

A group of around six students protested during and after a panel discussion on the politics and policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held by the Center for Jewish Civilization in Gaston Hall on Thursday evening.
During the question-and-answer section of the panel, the group of students got up and began chanting pro-Palestinian and anti-Netanyahu phrases before being escorted out of Gaston Hall by GUPD officers.
Outside of Healy Hall, the students held posters with messages such as “Netanyahu is a war criminal.”
The panel, entitled “The Netanyahu Premiership: A Retrospective,” was moderated by Georgetown CJC professor Elliott Abrams, who formerly served as White House adviser on U.S. Middle East policy. The event featured specialists of Middle East policy, including Natasha Mozgovaya, former Chief U.S. Correspondent for Israeli newspaper Haaretz, and Benny Morris, a Goldman Visiting Israeli Professor and Israeli historian.
In a statement to The Hoya, two of the student protestors, Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17) and MacKenzie Foy (COL ’19), said the panel was biased against Palestine and failed to include a diverse set of views.
“We want to bring visibility to the normalization of Netanyahu’s war crimes to campus and the oppression faced by Palestinian people at the hands of the Israeli state. We are concerned that a conversation about the Israeli state took place without talking about it as an occupation, as an apartheid,” Abdelfadeel said. “Georgetown as a Jesuit institution needs to be held accountable for its complicity in this and all state violence.”
One of the protestors held up a poster with a quote by Morris from a 2004 interview he conducted with the Haartez, in which he apparently refers to Palestinians as animals.
“Something like a cage has to be built for them. I know that sounds terrible. It is really cruel. But there is no choice,” Morris said in 2004. “There is a wild animal there that has to be locked up in one way or another.”
While the purpose of the event was to address Netanyahu’s strengths and weaknesses as prime minister of Israel, the audience drove the conversation toward Netanyahu’s actions concerning the Gaza Strip and the West Bank during the question-and-answer portion.
Alex Coopersmith (COL ’19), who attended the panel, said the panel and the questions asked showed the diversity of opinions in the Georgetown community.
“There were questions of ranging from, ‘Why are you not calling Israel a genocidal state?’ or ‘How come there were no Palestinians talking about this issue [at the event]?’ to questions that were very, very pro-Netanyahu,” Coopersmith said. “So I think it said the Georgetown community on the other hand values the role that question-and-answer plays instead of just one side.”
CJC Director Jacques Berlinerblau, CJC Associate Director Dennis McManus, CJC Center Manager Anna Dubinksy and CJC Events and Program Coordinator Michelyne Chavez did not respond to requests for comment as of 2:30 a.m. today.
Elodie Currier (SFS ’19), who attended the event, said the panelists tactfully tackled the complexity of Netanyahu’s actions.
“For the most part the panel did a really great job of keeping things civil and recognizing the nuance of things,” Currier wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Personally, I was really impressed with the panel’s ability to handle the protesters and to assuage questions that were at times just clear criticisms of Israel in general.”
According to Carol Hillman, a D.C. resident who attended the discussion, the protestors were unreasonable in their actions.
“It was a very interesting discussion about Netanyahu. Of course the Palestinian situation was brought into the conversation, but I don’t think it was a reason for a group of angry Palestinians to be in the conversation,” Hillman said. “It wasn’t about them, it was about Netanyahu and his behavior.”

Georgetown University College Democrats and College Republicans expanded upon key issues from this year’s election cycle during the upperclassman debate in the Healey Family Student Center Great Room on Tuesday.
GUCR, GUCD, the Georgetown Program Board and the Georgetown Institute for Politics and Public Service co-sponsored the event to provide an in-depth conversation on each party’s platform before Election Day on Nov. 8th. Issues addressed during the debate ranged from how to alleviate college debt and mitigate climate change to the Syrian refugee crisis and what should be done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
The event was moderated by CNN Senior Producer Brooke Brower and Ashley Spillane, former president of Rock the Vote, which seeks to mobilize the vote of young people, and current member of the GU Politics advisory board.
Former GUCD President Matthew Gregory (SFS ’17) introduced the debate, discussed the nature of political debates in this electoral cycle and said this election cycle has underscored the necessity for both parties to pursue a deeper discussion of substantive political issues.
“Democrat or Republican, I think we can all agree that we as a nation can do better than some of what we’ve received during this 2016 race,” Gregory said. “Tonight we gather to elevate the political discourse, we gather together to discuss the issues.”
For the first section of the debate on social issues, Meredith Forsyth (SFS ’19), Jessica Scoratow (COL ’18) and Mattie Haag (COL ’18) represented the Democratic Party, and Zachary Hughbanks (COL ’18), Harry Clow (COL ’19) and Mitchell Tu (SFS ’16) represented the Republican Party.
Forsyth said the Affordable Care Act revolutionized the American health care system.
“The Democratic Party believes that health care is a human right, not a privilege, and thanks to [President] Obama, we now have 20 million Americans under the Affordable Care Act who hadn’t been insured before, so we believe we have to protect and uphold Obamacare,” Forsyth said.
Hughbanks said the government should shift the focus toward privatizing health care and creating a more laissez-faire system.
“Obamacare has just destroyed middle-class and working-class communities across the nation,” Hughbanks said. “We need to return to a free-market reform, repeal Obamacare and implement an effective solution as outlined by Speaker [of the House] Paul Ryan.”
Shifting from health care to race relations, Tu said initiatives should focus less on blaming police officers and instead target the root of the problem by eradicating poverty and improving schooling.
“The solution of course isn’t by blaming police or attacking law enforcement,” Tu said. “It’s fixed by education reform, it’s fixed by economic control, its fixed by economic growth.”
Haag, a Democrat, said proper training for police is essential to reduce all differential minority treatment.
“There is empirical evidence that police are not trained enough and that they are actively shooting and being aggressive toward people of color versus white people,” Haag said.
Another major social issue addressed was abortion rights. Hughbanks said the issue was not about women’s rights.
“This isn’t an issue about women’s rights as much as it is an issue about the rights of the unborn, so what we’re saying before you’re born you have no rights and you can just be killed, ” Hughbanks said. “My position and the position of the Republican Party is that this is not a women’s issue; it’s an issue of protecting the rights of those of us who are unborn and have no other protections.”
Scoratow said that the Republican Party is hypocritical for being in favor of a woman’s right to choose.
“I think that if the Republican Party would like to be in support of a right to life, then they should be in support of things that ensure people’s right to life, like gun control,” Scoratow said. “It is really a basic issue of bodily autonomy for women.”
Joel Elkins (SFS ’18), Jawad Pullin (COL ’18), and Max Rosner (COL ’18) spoke for the Democrats on issues of finance, while the Republican side included Stephen Yin, Christopher Crocki and Michalel Parmiter.
Rosner said it is important for the next administration to raise the minimum wage, so that those earning it can at least afford to pay for their basic living expenses.
“If you were to work 40 hours per week at $7.25, making around $15,000, honestly that’s pathetic. If you’re working 40 hours per week you should at least be able to feed yourself and feed your family, so the Democratic Party, at least, unlike the standard bearer of the Republican Party believes that wages are not too high,” Rosner said. “The Democratic Party believes that $15 should be the starting talking point for minimum wage.”
In response to the Democratic argument, Yin said that raising the minimum wage could hamper the economy and lead to lower rates of employment.
“The question shouldn’t be whether we should raise the minimum wage or not, but rather what’s the best solution to get people to average salaries without reducing their purchasing power,” Yin said. “An increase in the minimum wage could reduce job growth.”
According to Parmiter, instituting higher education options other than four-year universities is critical to ensure students have the experience necessary to secure professional employment.
“I think what you have to look at instead of the affordability of college is the job prospects after it,” Parmiter said. “I think more people in America should go to a trade school or a two-year college, without taking out these massive loans, and then when they get out they can actually secure a job.”
To end the debate, Alex Coopersmith (COL ’19), Matt Hinson (SFS ’17), Madison Pravecek (SFS ’19) represented the Democrats, and Clow, Erica Tillotson (COL ’18), Hunter Estes (SFS ’19), and Richard Howell (SFS ’19) represented the Republican side to discuss foreign policy.
Hinson argued that although Obama may have erred on the side of caution, his policies in Syria have yielded successes and that Democratic Presidential Nominee Hillary Clinton’s policies will yield to even greater reductions in loss of life.
“We have engaged in Syria, we have been striking ISIS, ISIS has lost over 40 percent of its territory so far, and we have had the success of causing Bashar al-Assad to reduce his chemical arsenal,” Hinson said. “Looking forward to the Clinton administration, Hillary Clinton is going to take a very active approach in protecting civilians in Syria.”
Howell emphasized the Obama administration’s interventions as insufficient and argued in favor of the deployment of ground troops in the region.
“From the beginning of the Arab Spring the United States has not done anything effectively in Syria. … Later Obama promised a red line if Assad used chemical weapons and that red line was crossed,” Hinson said. “We need to work with our partners for real, assure Turkey and Israel that we will commit troops to the region.”
Other students, such as Shanzeg Hameed (SFS ’17), said the debate was successful as a forum to further educate students about political discourse.
“I think it’s good that Georgetown has these sorts of events and opportunities for people to be able to discuss their opinions and to stimulate discussion and conversation,” Hameed said.

Georgetown University Forming a Radically Ethical Endowment Coalition, a student-organized group seeking  transparency in Georgetown’s endowment, demanded the university to divest from private prisons and companies that contribute to the “occupation of Palestine,” during a launch rally in Red Square Dec. 7.
Chris Morris (COL ’19), an organizer for GU F.R.E.E, said such investments contribute to human rights abuses both in the United States and abroad.
“We came together today to hold the university accountable for its role in perpetuating state violence with a specific goal of publicizing Georgetown’s holdings and companies which consistently and knowingly endanger human life,” Morris said.
According to a press release released by the campaign, students from GU F.R.E.E submitted a proposal to the Committee on Investment and Social Responsibility Oct. 12 requesting transparency on the university’s investments but have yet to receive a reply.
The coalition, which is endorsed by 17 students groups,  has also sent a letter to University President John J. DeGioia requesting confirmation that the university’s endowment is not invested in any companies that support private prisons or the “occupation of Palestine.” The letter demands a response by Jan. 13.
While members of GU F.R.E.E met with Chief Investment Officer Michael Barry and Associate Vice President of Operations Christina Roberts, Morris said the administration has not acted upon their request that Georgetown divest from companies perpetuating state violence.
“We find it hypocritical and disingenuous for Georgetown, a Jesuit academic institution, to profit off of the oppression,” Morris said. “Does cura personalis only apply when it doesn’t impact our investment returns? Is faith and justice limited by supply and demand?”
The coalition is endorsed by groups representing underrepresented populations and groups that advocate Palestinian independence from Israel, including the Georgetown chapter of the NAACP and GU Students for Justice in Palestine.
The Jewish Student Alliance, J Street U Georgetown and the Georgetown Israel Alliance are not members of the coalition.
Advocacy group Hoyas Against Hate released an online petition Sunday evening calling for the university to condemn the GU F.R.E.E. campaign.
“An anti-Israel proposal being heard by Georgetown University’s Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility (CISR) is misleading and one-sided,” the petition writes. “Supporting this proposal means perpetuating conflict and bringing hate to the Georgetown community. Rejecting this proposal means refusing to allow hate to divide our campus.”
Hoyas Against Hate did not respond to a request for comment as of 11:30 p.m.
GU F.R.E.E. said that while the group is planning to expand the coalition, it does not plan to invite J Street U Georgetown, which advocates for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. The national J Street organization does not support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanction movement because the BDS movement does not support a two-state solution, according to the J Street website.
“We are still in the process of building our coalition and will be meeting with more groups as the campaign progresses,” the group wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have not contacted nor do we intend to contact J Street U as their national charter explicitly condemn the BDS call from Palestinian civil society, which our call for divestment from companies that empower the Israeli occupation serve as a direct a response to.”
GU F.R.E.E said in a press release Georgetown’s investments should uphold the university’s values.
“Georgetown’s investments are not currently public, so there is no accountability for knowing what companies the university is invested in,” the statement reads.  “If the university is invested in state violence, that violates its Jesuit values.”
The coalition has been consulting with members of environmental advocacy group GU Fossil Free, which is currently pursuing a socially responsible investment policy with the university’s Board of Directors’ Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, which makes recommendations on socially responsible investments to the university.
The initiative comes after the board voted in June 2015 to divest from all coal companies.
GUFF member Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said the group has been pursuing a socially responsible investment policy beyond divestment from fossil fuels in the last year and a half.
Willard said an official statement of divestment from the university would carry weight regardless of whether Georgetown is actually investing in these controversial areas.
“Even if Georgetown is not invested in a particular issue, there is some merit to the university saying they’re divesting from that issue because there’s something about Georgetown saying we don’t condone this,” Willard said.
One of the campaign organizers Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ‘17) said the GU F.R.E.E campaign seeks to provide justice to those who deserve it.
“We want to affirm the agency of the Palestinian people. They, like all people, are entitled to tangible justice,” Abdelfadeel said. “We recognize that peace is impossible without justice, so we proudly endorse the 2005 call of Boycott Divestment Sanctions as a tool to hold Israel accountable for its crimes.”
MacKenzie Foy (COL ’19), who is an organizer for GU F.R.E.E., said Georgetown’s investment in private prisons is akin to continuing the legacy of slavery.
“There’s no legacy of slavery more present in American life than prisons. The university fails to end its complicity in practices which are antithetical to our foundational Jesuit principles,” Foy said. “While our president may assert our university’s commitment to justice, there have only been halfhearted efforts to follow through on promises of reconciliation. Reconciliation looks like divestment.”
Morris said this campaign is a way for students to fight back against state violence.
“Holding our university accountable is fighting back. Divestment is fighting back,” Morris said. “We have nothing to lose but our chains.”

Israeli actions, including the development of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, are putting the pursuit of a two-state solution to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict at risk, according to Maen Rashid Areikat, chief representative of the General Delegation of the Palestinian Liberation Organization to the United States, in the Bunn ICC Auditorium on Thursday.
“The best approach to resolve this conflict is going back to the basics. The basics of freedom, human rights, dignity, security, peace for all,” Areikat said. “If we all can agree that every nation, every people are entitled to the same rights, to the same privileges, to the same freedoms that other nations are entitled to, I believe we can always find a solution to the most difficult issues.”
School of Foreign Service professor Tamara Sonn, the Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani Professor in the History of Islam, introduced Areikat, who addressed a crowd of about 150.
Areikat said the United States, under President Donald J. Trump’s administration, must work with Israel to pursue a two-state solution. Areikat criticized the Trump administration’s reported efforts to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which both Palestine and Israel claim as their capital.
“They will only embolden Israel to be more aggressive and to rely on the logic of power instead of the power of logic in dealing with its neighbors and resolving conflicts,” Areikat said.
While promoting a peaceful resolution to the conflict, Areikat blamed the strife’s perpetuity on Israeli intransigence, suggesting that a continuation of Israel’s settlement policy in the West Bank could lead to a failure of the two-state solution.
Both Israel and Palestine have said a two-state solution, with an independent State of Israel and State of Palestine, is their preferred solution to the conflict. The two sides, however, have been unable to agree on border placement, among other issues, in attempts to strike a deal.
“We still believe that a two-state solution is the most ideal outcome for any political negotiations with Israel,” Areikat said. “Israelis and Palestinians must be separated in order for them—especially Palestinians—to develop their own national identity away from occupation and oppression, and for Israelis to reap the fruits of the peace and security that they have long desired.”
The PLO officially recognized the right of Israel to exist in the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords. According to Areikat, Palestine does not pose a danger to Israel.
However, Areikat said the only path to stability for Israel in the region is a settlement with Palestine.
“Israel’s security will be guaranteed if they make peace with the Palestinians who are going to share the land with them. They cannot make peace with any other Arab countries if they cannot make peace with us. They will never enjoy security,” Areikat said. “It’s not because we are threatening them; it’s because there will be no stability if we Palestinians do not feel that we are getting our rights back.”
Delta Phi Epsilon, Georgetown’s professional foreign service fraternity, arranged the event, but as an unrecognized student group without access to benefits, needed Sonn to reserve the auditorium.
Areikat said Arabs and Palestinians prioritize resolving this conflict, even if some Israel advocates say surrounding Arab nations do not care about it as much as other conflicts in the region.
“No matter what Israel tries to portray that Arab countries are busy and the Palestinian issue is on the backburner – maybe that applies to some Arab governments, but it does not apply to the Arab masses who continue to believe that the Palestinian people are an oppressed people who need to win their freedom,” Areikat said. “We continue to extend our hands for peace, but it takes two to tango.”

The Georgetown administration declined to disclose a list of companies the university invests in, following advocacy group Georgetown University Forming a Radically Ethical Endowment Coalition’s request last month to create a more transparent endowment.
GU F.R.E.E, which has been endorsed by 17 student groups, submitted a letter Dec. 7 to University President John J. DeGioia demanding that the university divest from investments in private prisons and companies that contribute to the “occupation of Palestine.”
The group set a deadline for a response by Jan. 13, which university officials missed.
Members of GU F.R.E.E. want more transparency from university officials about how Georgetown uses its endowment.
The coalition is endorsed by groups advocating for underrepresented populations and groups that support Palestinian independence from Israel, including the Georgetown chapter of the NAACP as well as GU Students for Justice in Palestine.
The Jewish Student Alliance, J Street U Georgetown and the Georgetown Israel Alliance are not members of the coalition.
Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara said in an email to GU F.R.E.E. provided to The Hoya that the university’s standard practice is to not disclose its investments.
GU F.R.E.E. said the campaign will continue to press for a list of investments.
“The administration’s refusal to sign our letter indicates to us that we have some sort of relationship with the named companies and as such, we will move forward with our campaign,” GU F.R.E.E. wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the university’s Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, which advises the university on its investments, is considering the demands listed in the group’s December letter.
J Street U Georgetown said in a statement that “Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions” movements like GU F.R.E.E’s are ineffective in achieving a two-state solution, its preferred solution to the conflict between Palestine and Israel. J Street instead called for constructive criticism of Israeli policy rather than calls for taking away funding for Israeli companies.
“We do not believe that B.D.S. movements are an effective or helpful way to to end the conflict and reach a peaceful resolution,” the statement reads. “We encourage positive reinvestment into the Palestinian economy and civil society and diplomatic negotiation as a means to achieve a lasting peace agreement.”
GU F.R.E.E. has said it did not plan on inviting J Street U Georgetown.
J Street U’s statement, however, noted that those involved with GU F.R.E.E. have been willing to discuss their position with student groups opposed to their message. The group affirmed their support for Palestinian rights.
“We have met with individuals involved in the GU FREE campaign and appreciate their willingness to explain their position and support the safety of all students on campus,” the statement read.
GU F.R.E.E. launched an official website and campaign Wednesday. The group plans to raise awareness of the issues affecting underrepresented populations as it pushes the university to pursue a more transparent endowment, according to the group.
“We intend to raise awareness and constructive conversation surrounding both issues to problematize the normalization of these human rights violations,” the statement reads. “We plan to put pressure on the University until it recognizes the glaring contradictions of our Jesuit values and subsidization of state violence via our investment practices.”

Political tensions are putting progress toward a peace deal between Israel and Palestine on hold according to think tank The Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy fellows Ghaith al-Omari and David Makovsky in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room on Tuesday.
“What are the main threats right now? I think it is politics. Often, people — they look at this conflict and say that it’s unsolvable,” al-Omari said. “These are difficult issues that I believe are solvable.”
A new student initiative, Georgetown Bipartisan Pro-Israel Dialogue, hosted the panelists to discuss the future of U.S.-Israel relations, for its first-ever event.
The event was co-sponsored by Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown University College Republicans, Georgetown Israel Alliance, J Street U Georgetown, the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition and the foreign policy discussion group Alexander Hamilton Society. GBPID Director Matthew Gregory (SFS ’17) moderated the event.
Al-Omari has been a negotiator for the Palestinian Authority and the executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine, an organization that promotes Palestinian statehood in the United States.
Makovsky has served as a senior advisor to the Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations and as the executive editor of The Jerusalem Post.
Al-Omari said domestic political troubles in both Israel and Palestine are making progress on a peace deal challenging.
“On the Israeli side, we see a coalition that is quite right-wing, a coalition that cannot, in its current formulation, actually make the concession that would let us reach a peace deal,” al-Omari said. “And on the Palestinian side, what do we see? We see a divided politic. We see a president who is in the twelfth year of a four-year term. We see a parliament that is also long defunct. We see the Palestinian public — 80 percent of Palestinians believe the government is corrupt.”
According to Al-Omari, although most Israelis and Palestinians believe that peace is desirable, they fear that peace is not possible.
The two sides were able to make progress towards peace under former President Barack Obama’s administration, according to Makovsky, but regional troubles in the aftermath of the Arab Spring prevented a deal from being reached.
Makovsky stressed the success of the Obama administration in improving the borders and security of Israel.
President Donald Trump has made a series of policy announcements with respect to Israel, from planning to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to charging Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner, who is also Trump’s son-in-law, with the task of advancing peace in the region.
The nature of the situation regarding U.S.-Israel relations in the Trump administration, al-Omari said, is uncertain as of yet.
“What we don’t know, we simply do not know, in foreign policy, at least, in the Middle East, where this administration is. We will not know for a while. Policy is not only made by a president,” al-Omari said. “So, on foreign policy as yet, I am withholding judgment. If I were to judge, I would even say cautiously optimistic.”
Al-Omari said the early policy indications are positive.
“On the Palestinian-Israeli issue, I think, frankly, political things aside, he has shown restraint,” al-Omari said. “He came as a president who was against the establishment, yet, as I look at the practice at the embassy — not moving any time soon.”
Makovsky said it is important to be optimistic regarding the ability to make progress toward a peace deal.
“There’s always, in the American imagination, the idea of American interest and American values,” Makovsky said. “I think what [al-Omari] said was accurate: don’t write things off so fast, because the way our leaders have reacted over the Iran nuclear deal and the other issues where they thought that the U.S. would—they thought the U.S. was going to throw them over the edge.”
Gregory said GBPID is looking to establish dialogue on the peace process with guaranteed Israeli sovereignty.
“The fundamental premise upon which this program is based, however, is actually quite simple,” Gregory said. “Once parties agree to accept Israel’s right to exist as a sovereign state, particularly one retaining its Jewish and democratic character, only then may constructive dialogue be held to determine how best to go about achieving peace in the region.”

The Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility plans to advise the board of directors to establish a policy of no direct investment in private prison companies and to avoid commingled funds with investments in private prison companies “to the maximum extent possible,” according to a memo published by the committee today.
CISR also concluded that divestment would not be effective in promoting a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The committee’s memo comes in response to a petition submitted by Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17), Sophia Bauerschmidt Sweeney (COL ’17) and Salma Khamis (SFS ’17) to Georgetown in October, which demanded that the university divest from private prison companies and companies that contribute to the “occupation of Palestine.”
After its review of the proposal, CISR has concluded by a majority vote that the proposal does not merit consideration by the board of directors. Specifically, the committee took issue with the petition’s request to divest from companies and funds that have investments in the private prison industry.
“CISR found that these companies do not have sufficiently direct involvement in the industry,” the report stated.
In the memo, CISR also recommended that the university use other methods of exploring peaceful resolutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“In reaching this conclusion, the Committee took into consideration the views of University community members, many of whom are deeply concerned about this conflict and have many different perspectives and ideas on how to address it,” the report stated. “CISR encourages the Georgetown community to use the resources of our university – academic research, teaching and learning, co–curricular programming, and community–based service – to create dialogue, foster understanding, and explore peaceful solutions to this conflict.”
In its original proposal, which was endorsed by at least 17 student groups, the three students requested that the university publicly disclose its investments, setting a deadline by Jan. 13. In late January, University Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara declined the group’s request, citing that it is not the university’s standard practice to disclose investments.
This article will be updated as more information becomes available.
Clarification: An earlier version of this article stated the GU F.R.E.E. submitted the proposal. It was independently submitted by three students.

Eman says 
March 2, 2017 at 7:06 pm
Thanks for covering this! Just a few clarifications.
1.  GU F.R.E.E. did not submit this proposal; the 3 students that you listed this.
2. We submitted this in October, not December.
3. The occupation of Palestine is legally recognized and not a matter of opinion so I’m not sure why the Hoya has always put it in quotation marks in your pieces.

The Georgetown University College Republicans came under fire this week for inviting advocacy group Former Muslims United Director Nonie Darwish, who some critics have called Islamophobic, to speak on campus Tuesday evening.
Darwish promoted her new book, “Wholly Different,” which explores the differences between Christian and Islamic values, at the event.
Darwish, an Egyptian-born American, is head of the Former Muslims United, which seeks to protect former Muslims from persecution, and founder of pro-Israel advocacy group Arabs for Israel.
During her speech, Darwish strongly criticized Islamic values.
“Under Islam, the values of Islam, number one is jihad, everyone is sacrificed for jihad, the man has to die for jihad, the woman has to be oppressed,” Darwish said. “Because her role — number one — is to support jihad and to even ask her husband to become a jihadist. That is a good wife under Islamic law.”
Georgetown’s Bridge Initiative hosted an alternative event starting a half hour before the Darwish talk titled ‘Muslim Responses to Islamaphobia with Wajahat Ali.’ Ali is an Al Jazeera journalist and State Department official.
Darwish’s comments invoked a strong reaction from some members of the audience. On several occasions, GUCR moderators asked shouting audience members to quiet down and allow Darwish to speak.
The controversy over the event has been picked up by several right-leaning publications, including The Daily Caller and the Washington Examiner. According to the Washington Examiner, students shouted pro-Muslim slurs to Darwish at the event and she had to be escorted in and out by security.
According to Georgetown University College Republicans President Allie Williams (SFS ’19), the Examiner’s account is inaccurate. Williams said Darwish took questions from emotional and, at times, belligerent audience members, and there were occasional shouts, but there were no large protests and the event was largely civil.
“I don’t think they were protesters, they were just students who were challenging her,” Williams said. “That was the reason of the event.”
Williams also said there was a large police presence of over Georgetown University Police Department officers, most in plain clothes, due to the controversial nature of the speaker at the public event. However, she said the event went without incident and Darwish was only escorted off campus as a standard precautionary procedure.
“She had a book signing at the end,” Williams said. “There was no issue with her leaving or anything like that. At no point was I worried about anything happening to her or her safety.”
The day before the event, former GUCR Executive Board member Javon Price (COL ’20) resigned his position, writing in a Facebook post that he was motivated to do so by the Darwish event.
“As not only Republicans, but moral human beings, capable of both empathy and compassion, we should also fight against proponents of hate speech,” Price wrote. “With the invitation and sponsorship of event highlighting Nonie Darwish and her hate-filled book, we are giving a platform to a dangerous and toxic ideology. I for one, reject and condemn any organization that hides behind the righteous principles of free speech.”
According to Williams, Price voted to maintain Darwish’s invitation before his resignation. Williams said the public nature of Price’s resignation is disappointing.
“I totally respect his choice to resign, but I don’t respect the way in which he publicly made a statement about us all being bigots,” Williams said. “I don’t appreciate the way in which he publicly tried to slander everyone.”
Williams defended the decision to invite Darwish, saying there is a “double standard” in the reaction to speakers that are invited to campus.
“We believe that she has a personal story and I believe she has every right to share that personal story on our campus so we gave her a platform to do that,” Williams said. “We’re a Republican organization, no matter who we bring there’s obviously going to be backlash.”

I happen to know Nonie (not well), and I know why she left Islam. It was because she couldn’t understand why she was supposed to hate Christians and Jews. I am not talking about all Muslims, but it is time they and the rest of us faced up to the intolerance that exists today within Islam. Virtually every Muslim-majority country persecutes religious minorities.  Why is that? It is because Islamic religious texts tell them to (Koran Hadith, Sunna).

Shame on Javon and shame on Rabbi Gartner for trying to disrupt the event.  I know the latter “only” hosted another at the same time in order to hurt attendance, but a more appropriate response would have been to host their “Islamophobia” event at another time or attend the CR event and engage in dialogue.  But Rabbi Gartner is super liberal, just like the rest of Campus Ministry, so it is to be expected.

For at least five years, I have read authorship and watched videos at the GU campus-located Prince Al-Waleed Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding.  The ACMCU web record has a complete recorded zero of past publicized seminars in venues of expectable size, WITH PUBLIC ATTENDANCE by Christian GU community residents. 
Instead, what I see in posts there are silent persons (without questions), and none of them are curious regarding violence found in Islam’s texts (Qur’an & Sunnah), subsequently brought to reality during by the life of Muhammad.
Based on that, I now firmly believe that John Esposito, Jordan Duffner, Engy Abdelkader, and others working there are essentially motivated by avoidance of dialogue between Muslims and Christians.  Why?
They know how a thoroughly open, fully free arena for discussion would be revelatory — and therefore use endless smears of “Islamophobe”, “racist” and “bigot” against every critic — no matter if opposition derives from rigorous scholarship.

What the hell? “Pro-Muslim slurs” ? This can’t be real. If you are think there is such a thing as a “pro-Muslim slur,” much less one that would be “shouted at Darwish,” then God help you. These are the same people who are scared by the words sharia and jihad without caring to understand the meaning behind them. 
There’s a reason why everyone who takes an actual course on Islamic studies ends up realizing Islamophobia is real — because the people spewing the nonsense about how Muslims hate everyone or feel the intrinsic need to oppress women don’t understand Islamic law or history. Take a couple of classes from certified professors of Islamic studies, read books that aren’t funded by the Islamophobia industry, and realize that everyone is human. 
People are free to listen to extremists like Nonie Darwish, who represent 0.01% of Muslims, and take her word as gospel to massage their confirmation bias, but they’re deluding themselves if they think that she is some savior to Muslim women who are too oppressed to speak out by themselves against the tyranny they live under. She has the right to say whatever she wants, but please, just do not report anything with the words “pro-Muslim slur” ever again. You go to Georgetown for God’s sake.

The Georgetown University Police Department has launched an investigation after posters were placed in several locations on and off campus by Identity Evropa, a white national group, Sunday night.
The posters, placed in locations including Red Square and Village A, included several white nationalist slogans, such as “Our destiny is ours,” “Serve your people,” and “Let’s become great again.” The group took credit for the posters on its Twitter account.
By Monday night, many of the posters had been taken down by students. GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said campus police were investigating the matter.
“We have recently been made aware of the posters,” Gruber wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are currently investigating this.”
The group, founded at California State University Stanislaus, has plastered posters at universities across the country, including the University of California, Los Angeles, Pennyslvania State University and the University of Washington. A past campaign at Indiana University specifically targeted the offices of professors of color.
The Southern Poverty Law Center identified the group as white nationalist on their website in February.
Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson said in a statement to The Hoya the campaign is an act of hate.
“The posters appear to be part of a campaign by an outside group that has posted similar materials on campuses across the country. Acts of hate will not be tolerated on Georgetown’s campus,” the statement reads. “We are a community that welcomes all people and that values understanding, dignity, inclusion and respect.”
Georgetown University Student Association President-elect Kamar Mack (COL ’19) and Vice President-elect Jessica Andino (COL ’18) said the posters stray beyond the territory of free speech into harassment.
“We are appalled to see that these flyers that promote hate were spread across campus. Because of the hateful message that the organization embodies, this crosses the line of free speech into dangerous territory of harassment,” Mack and Andino wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We are committed to promoting a tolerant speech environment where there is fruitful dialogue.”
Mack and Andino also encouraged students to use the university’s Bias Reporting System, which allows students to report bias incidents to the university.
“At this time we want to remind students that Georgetown has a Bias Reporting System if they feel any of their identities have been targeted in a threatening manner,” Mack and Andino wrote. “We would also like to emphasize the current guidelines of the Speech and Expression Policy as laid out by the university and to express that during our administration we plan to continue programming that informs the student body of these guidelines.”
The Georgetown Bipartisan Pro-Israel Dialogue denounced the posters and Identity Evropa in a post to the group’s Facebook page Monday.
“These individuals may be blinded by hatred and ignorance; the Georgetown population, however, is not,” the post reads. “For we are Georgetown, and we are one family. And no Hitler dress-up club can touch that.”

How are these acts of hate? The posters are of statues with text saying “Our Destiny is Ours,” “Serve Your People,” and “Let’s Become Great Again.” 
Seems pretty harmless.  Far from the harassment Kamar hysterically claims it to be.
And please explain how this is different from other race-based identity groups at Georgetown seeking to promote their own racial identity groups . . .
We have “The Black House” and “Casa Latina,” both race-based segregationist housing programs which put on programming with the specific goal promoting Black and Latino identity and which often put on anti-White events.
We have a ton of clubs devoted exclusively to the promotion of racial solidarity and advancement by race. They just happen to all be non-White races.  
Why is it only non-White groups are allowed to advocate for themselves or show pride in their history?
How come when a group of White people seek to care about their own race it’s all of a sudden bad thing?
If we believe the races are equal and should be treated equally, shouldn’t Whites be allowed the same rights and privileges non-Whites are allowed when it comes to supporting and identifying with their own racial groups?
If it’s wrong for Whites to be proud of their identity and the accomplishments of Whites and the many wonderful things Whites have done, and if Whites feeling solidarity for each other is wrong, then shouldn’t, if we believe in equality and equal treatment, condemn Black and Latino and Asian and Arab identity groups WHO DO THE EXACT SAME THING?
There is a huge double standard here, in addition to a lot of anti-White hate.
If you think it’s wrong for Whites to be proud of who they are but okay for other races to be proud of who they are, or if you think Whites shouldn’t help and promote each other based on race but think it’s okay for other races to help and promote each other based on race, then you’re a huge hypocrite.

A collective response is needed against the recent worldwide swell of anti-Semitism, according to former United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Ira N. Forman in an event hosted by the Georgetown University Center for Jewish Civilization on Wednesday.
“Words are terribly important. It’s absolutely essential for not just the president, but Congress, and local elected officials, to speak out,” Forman said in the Intercultural Center Auditorium. “If civil society does not come to our side, it’s over. This is about the very values of the French republic. By extension, you could say it’s about the values of liberal democracy. That’s what’s at stake.”
According to Forman, while 49 percent of Americans surveyed agreed with the statement that anti-Semitism in the United States is a very serious or somewhat serious problem in a Quinnipiac University poll conducted last February, 70 percent of responders agreed with the same statement in the same poll conducted last week.
“There has been a real change in the United States of, at least, perceptions of incidents of anti-Semitism,” Forman said.
Anti-Semitism has come under the spotlight in recent months. There have been 67 bomb threats against Jewish community centers since January, according to The New Republic, while in February, tombstones in a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis, were turned over.
Forman said the complexity of modern-day anti-Semitism renders easy solutions impossible.
“There are no simple silver bullets here that we have, partly because of the difficulty and the complexity of the problem,” Forman said.
Forman said, however, that Jews are not in as dire straits as they were in the 1930s, when Jews faced persecution around the world, including in Nazi Germany. However, he warned that the world must learn from that perilous decade.
“Is this the 1930s? The answer is no, it is not. But if it’s not the 1930s, there are some really important lessons and issues we have to deal with. First of all, I believe history does run in cycles,” Forman said.
Forman specifically highlighted economic transformations as a trigger for xenophobia that corresponds with a rise in anti-Semitism.
“What pops for me out of the 1930s is economic dislocation and the rise of xenophobia. The other thing that is very clear is that we are 70 years past the Holocaust,” Forman said. “The generation that was alive during the Holocaust is quickly dying off. We forgot the implications, and that maybe is natural.”
As U.S. special envoy, Forman said he noticed how anti-Semitism takes different shapes in different countries.
“Xenophobic right-wing nationalism is driving anti-Semitism in Hungary. In France, you have xenophobic right-wing nationalism, but Jews also face anti-Semitism from the extreme left, often associated with green or anti-colonial movements, or anti-Israel sentiment,” Forman said.
Forman said prejudice against Jews could be seen as a feature, rather than an exception, of Western society.
“Whether it’s Hellenistic anti-Semitism during the Commonwealth Period, Christian anti-Semitism that dominated the first millennium and a half of the common era, racist anti-Semitism in the post-Enlightenment era or even anti-Semitism that is often masked behind anti-Israel rhetoric; all those have commonalities that are central to Western civilization,” Forman said.
Collective action by civil society is more ingrained in American culture than in European culture, according to Forman.
“In the U.S., civil society generally does stand up. We can do it better — we can certainly do it better against Islamophobia — but we have that mechanism that is really important. That mechanism does not largely exist in Europe.”
Georgetown Israel Alliance’s Political Chair Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20), who attended the event, said he appreciated that Forman distinguished anti-Semitism from criticism of Israel.
“It was very important that he highlighted that anti-Semitism and anti-Israel criticism are not the same thing, and people should not fall into the trap of automatically accusing anti-Israel sentiment of being anti-Semitic,” Larkin said. “However, they often are associated with one another.”
Larkin said that despite increased incidents against Jews in America, he has felt increased support from the community, especially from non-Jews.
“I felt a real upsurge in support for the Jewish community from many non-Jews, including many Muslims,” Larkin said. “It’s been a real wake-up call that anti-Semitism is present in our society, and we need to stand up against it.”

Georgetown joined 30 peer institutions in signing an amicus brief condemning the effects of President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting entry of citizens from six Muslim-majority countries Sunday.
The brief is part of other measures announced by University President John J. DeGioia yesterday in response to Trump’s immigration order. Other initiatives include a training session for immigrant students on their rights if they are detained and advocacy for comprehensive immigration reform.
In light of the current national climate on immigration, the university community also came together last night in a vigil organized by the administration in solidarity with vulnerable communities on campus. About 50 students, faculty, administrators and members of the religious community attended the vigil, which highlighted religious teachings on immigration and refugees.
In a campuswide email Monday, DeGioia highlighted the contributions of campus communities now vulnerable under the Trump administration.
“We recognize the invaluable role that our Muslim and international students, scholars, staff, and faculty play — and the importance of protecting the ability of all members of our community to freely practice their religion,” DeGioia wrote.
Trump’s March 6 order cited national security concerns as a reason to enact a 90-day suspension on immigration from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
The amicus brief was filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Maryland, which is set to hear oral arguments in a lawsuit brought against Trump and other members of his administration May 8. The plaintiffs in the case are requesting a stay of the order.
An amicus curiae brief, otherwise known as a “friend of the court” brief, is a legal instrument through which a person or group that is not party to a lawsuit can petition the court on behalf of the plaintiffs or defendants and thus sway the court’s decision.
The brief, signed by institutions including Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University and Stanford University, specifically cited the benefits gained from the signatories’ diverse student bodies as an interest in the lawsuit.
“Each amicus has a global mission and benefits from the contributions of diverse students, faculty, staff, and scholars from around the world,” the brief reads. “Because amici seek to educate future world leaders, attract the world’s best scholars, faculty, and students, and work across international borders, they rely on their ability to welcome international students, faculty, and scholars into their communities.”
The universities argued in the brief that international students, faculty and scholars are vital to their interests and cited the fact that U.S. universities accepted more than 1 million international students as a reason for suspending the ban. Such students, the brief says, accounted for 5 percent of national enrollment in the 2015-16 academic year.
The faculty senate, which consists of 75 full-time faculty members from the main campus, medical school and Law Center alongside senior administrators, announced in a campuswide email yesterday that they approved a resolution March 20 supporting those affected by the order, citing “America’s proud tradition” of welcoming immigrants.
“It is not for the United States government to adopt one religion and to reject individuals simply because of their religion or nationality,” the resolution reads. “We resolve to support and protect our faculty, staff, and students who have been and will be harmed by the order, and to stand up for their rights, including the protection of personal information, unless required by legal process.”
Director of Jewish Life Rabbi Rachel Gartner, who spoke at last night’s vigil, said the Jewish community feels a special bond of empathy with immigrants.
“We understand ourselves as a wandering people, and we understand what it’s like to be welcomed to a country when it’s convenient for that country and tossed out when it is fashionable,” Gartner said. “The Jewish community stands with our immigrant community because 36 times in our Torah — no less than 36 times — we are exhorted to treat the sojourner who lives among us exactly as we would treat ourselves.”
Although Trump has stated that he seeks to protect individuals present in the United States without authorization who would be granted relief under the DREAM Act, multiple reports of such detainments by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have surfaced in recent days. Against this backdrop, advocacy student group UndocuHoyas launched the inaugural UndocuWeek this week.
Luis Gonzalez (COL ’19), a student without documentation, said this kind of university rhetoric is what has made him feel welcome at Georgetown.
“The fact that as students we are able to put aside our differences and be able to listen and to have an open mind is what continues to convince me Georgetown is my home,” Gonzalez said. “I hope people in our community realize the huge impact they have in making sure those who are affected by drastic policy changes, hatred, among other things, feel supported.”
Aly Panjwani (SFS ’19), a Muslim student who attended the vigil, said the university has a special duty to advocate for the international community because of its religious background and history.
“Georgetown, a Jesuit Catholic university, with its history of participating in these oppressive power structures, has a responsibility to fervently counter this dangerous ideology in the White House,” Panjwani said. “Furthermore, it is these vulnerable communities that bring diversity and value to our Georgetown community and we must do our utmost to protect them.”
DeGioia emphasized other initiatives in the email, including the hiring of undocumented student adviser Arelis Palacios in November. He concluded that the international character of the university is essential to its mission.
“Ours is a global community — one made stronger by our religious, cultural and international diversity,” DeGioia wrote. “Today, and as we have throughout our history, we will make the effort required of us to support, sustain, and advance our global character, our commitment to religious diversity and interreligious dialogue, our commitment to freedom of speech, and our work to promote dialogue and encourage civility.”

Trumps temporary immigration ban on countries with active terrorists training camps is common sense. No one is trying to ban anyone from freedom to practice religion. The US and Europe are being targeted by groups such as ISIS which has a strong presence in all of the countries on the watch list.
 Most if not all of these countries are in a state of chaos if not out right civil war.Yeah it’s just great that everyone hates Trump but in this case he is right. It is also his legal right under the constitution. If Obama were still in office and he made the same request none of you altruistic, liberal minded, ivory tower, students would say a word? You people had better pray that no terrorists come in while this presidential mandate is blocked!

Hey Rachel, how come Israel doesn’t let in this Muslim refugees?  Israel is a lot closer?  Will you advocate for Israel to accept them?  Doesn’t Israel have a responsibility here?  Why is it Jews are all for other groups immigrating to Europe and America, but have very strict, some might say harsh rules when it comes to immigration to Israel?  
You can take all these Muslim refugees in, but you won’t?  Why not?  And if the Jewish state of Israel won’t do it, why should America?

Another maddening article filled with statements that are irrelevant to the Executive Order itself, and give clear and obvious witness that it has not actually been read in its entirety. Georgetown as well as the other entities mentioned as in support of the amicus brief (Harvard, Yale, Columbia and Stanford) are educational institutions, correct? In order for an accurate and valuable commentary on any executive order, surely it would be expected that the document should be read and digested. So please….READ THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. Don’t just rely, as it seems many of you dear students have done, on a couple of media sound bites. READ THE EXECUTIVE ORDER. By the way, there are two Executive Orders with the same title: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. The first, issued January 27th has now been rescinded and replaced with a second, dated March 6. Both available on the website whitehouse.gov . But I’m not going to do any more homework for you.  Read the Order and then you will have something worth bringing to the discussion. As a previous commentator noted, the Order is NOT a ban based on religion. There are in fact, forty-two Muslim majority countries that are NOT under the watch list and only six that are.
After you read the Order, to shed some very necessary light on the entire refugee and immigrant issue, I would suggest you bring up a very pertinent article on Imprimis, the publication of Hillsdale College: Who We Are as a People – the Syrian Refugee Question, by Edward Erler. His premise is that Americans and others worldwide have rejected the value of belief in absolute truth based on God and of His natural order in creation and have replaced truth with subjectivism. (My truth is just as valuable and true as your truth.)  Then the only thing that is of real value is tolerance for all viewpoints and a corresponding committment to diversity. Note that it is a COMMITMENT to diversity. Supporting the principle of allowing people from terrorist countries to freely enter the US with improper checks is a clear proof that one is “truly committed to diversity” (willing to make the supreme sacrifice of experiencing possible terrorist activity) This commitment to diversity has replaced commitment to the natural law and the revealed truth of Jesus Christ. So….read the EO and the Erler article, then go grab some beers and have a discussion.

The future of Zionism should be focused on the self-determination of Jews and Palestinians in the Middle East, according to panelists at the event “Unpacking Zionism” co-sponsored by pro-Israel group J Street Georgetown and the Georgetown Israel Alliance on Wednesday night in the Intercultural Center.
The event sought to offer several Jewish perspectives on Zionism, an ideology that advocates for the existence of a Jewish nation.
The panel, moderated by J Street Georgetown Co-chair Julia Friedmann (SFS ’19), included reflections on Zionism from GIA Cultural Chair Aviv Lis (COL ’19), Former GIA Vice President Jonathan Muhlrad (COL ’17), former GIA President Madeline Cunnings (COL ’18) and J Street Georgetown Co-chair Abigail Ulman (SFS ’19).
Lis said the roots of the modern political ideology of Zionism began in the early history of Judaism.
“Zionism is the national liberation movement of the Jewish people, through which we realize we are not only a people, but a nation that has a homeland,” Lis said. “We’re reminded of Zionism every year during Passover when we sing ‘L’shana haba’ah b’yerushalayim,’ or ‘Next year in Jerusalem’ — that is not a new thing that started in 1948.”
For Muhlrad, Zionism has deep personal meaning.
“I think about Zionism, I think about my grandparents — three of who were technically stateless persons after the Holocaust,” Muhlrad said. “Zionism is liberation from a history of oppression.”
Lis said Judaism and Zionism are not synonymous, but for many Jews they are closely interconnected.
“Zionism has a very important part in the collective Jewish play,” Lis said. “A lot of Holocaust survivors found their home in Israel after the war ended, some believing in God and some not. It’s a part of our Jewish history.”
Cunnings said her Israel-born mother raised her to see Zionism as a fact of life for Jews.
“There are non-Jewish Zionists and non-Zionist Jews,” Cunnings said. “Obviously, yes, they’re separate for some people. For me, I can’t fathom Judaism without Israel and Zionism.”
Ulman, though Jewish and self-avowedly pro-Israel, said she lacks a personal and spiritual connection to Zionism.
“I believe in the right of Israel to exist, and for Jews to have the right to live there, but I think Zionism has turned into something very spiritual and personal for a lot of people, and because I don’t have that connection, it wouldn’t be right for me to call myself a Zionist,” Ulman said.
Ulman also noted some people use the Zionist label to commit hateful acts. Nevertheless, Ulman said Zionism is not inherently racist, xenophobic or hateful.
“We need to recognize Zionism has been used for these destructive acts,” Ulman said. “In many cases, Zionism has not been this blanket good resembling Judaism. But define your own Zionism, [recognize] this happened and [create] a new vision of Zionism that is inclusive and equal.”
Muhlrad said Zionism is not defined by the actions of some of its followers.
“Just because there are some militant communists, that doesn’t then condemn all Communism or whatever that might be,” Muhlrad said. “What I would say to all people who do terrible things in the name of Zionism is that they need to become better Zionists. It doesn’t nullify Zionism.”
Lis said it is not racist for Jews to support a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. However, he noted the importance of compassion and understanding the historical ties between Jews in the 20th century and Palestinians today.
“My grandpa, living in war-ravaged Poland, yearning to live in the land of his people, is no different from a Palestinian farmer yearning to return to the olive grove his grandfather planted in Jaffa. It’s the same homeland, and we need to figure out how our national aspirations can coexist,” Lis said. “Those destructive acts, Baruch Goldstein’s massacre of Palestinians — he’s not a Zionist in my mind.”

“Lis said it is not racist for Jews to support a Jewish homeland in the Middle East. However, he noted the importance of compassion and understanding the historical ties between Jews in the 20th century and Palestinians today.”
If it’s not racist for Jews to support a Jewish homeland, or say, Japanese or Chinese to support a Japanese or Chinese homeland, or Arabs or Africans to support an Arab country or African country they consider their homeland, then why is it considered racist for Europeans or Whites to seek to persevere a European or White homeland?

The event was co-sponsored by the Office of Community Engagement, the Justice and Peace Studies Program, the American Studies Department and the African Studies Program.  Terrence Johnson, associate professor of religion and government, introduced Brooks and addressed the historic partnership between Jews and blacks in the 20th century, especially during the Civil Rights Movement.
“When we think about the 1960s, the so-called golden age of the relationship between African-Americans and Jews, I think it’s important to take note that it’s a lot deeper than the folks who are the most prominent,” Brooks said.
Brooks highlighted that the propagation of racist and anti-Semitic tropes since the election season has made it more imperative than ever that blacks and Jews unite.
“We have an administration committed to taking us backward,” Brooks said. “We have two communities who are committed as a consequence of a canon of social justice to stand in opposition to it unapologetically.”
Brooks said that any reluctance to support the Black Lives Matter premise is empty and wrongheaded.
“Black Lives Matter is the moral predicate to the ethical conclusion that all lives matter. Unless the first is true, the second can never be true,” Brooks said.
Brooks rallied against the notion that Jews and blacks only fit together tactically, instead arguing that a shared commitment to justice through faith binds the two groups together.
“This is not just a union of convenience. The movement of the 1960s was based in the churches and the synagogues — it had a moral impulse to it,” Brooks said. “To the extent, across the country, we are seeing a return to grounding our efforts in faith. I think that is a moment for hope.”
Collaborating through faith and broad ideals has more lasting power than agreeing on specific issues alone, according to Brooks.
“If we are united by what we believe in as opposed to merely what we agree on, we will be together long enough to agree on more,” Brooks said.
Brooks noted the solidarity the NAACP has shown to harassed Jewish journalists on Twitter as evidence of the benefits of solidarity between the two groups.
“When we saw alt-right anti-Semites putting echo symbols around the names of Jewish journalists, we put echo symbols around the name of the NAACP and my name,” Brooks said. “We wanted to make it abundantly clear that these are our people too.”
Brooks maintained that absolute agreement on every problem is not necessary for a functional and productive relationship, pointing to often-differing views between members of the two groups on Israel and Zionism.
“We cannot paper over political differences with respect to affirmative action or differences with respect to Israel or the platform for black lives, or any of the differences that may stand to separate our communities,” Brooks said. “But we must fundamentally understand that we need not have consensus to appreciate that we share a moral foundation.”
Brooks extended his wish for dialogue between blacks and Jews to the setting of college campuses, saying that students should not be excluded from advocating for social justice efforts based on their positions on other issues.
“On the college campus, if you exclude anyone with per-se assumptions about who they are or what they represent, it’s dangerous. Not just in terms of foregone relationships and friendships, but also in us creating the very walls we are trying to dismantle,” Brooks said.
Brooks concluded by urging all attendees to incorporate the storied past of the alliance between the black and Jewish communities to create real change in the present.
“This is a moment for our history to inspire the present. This is not a moment for us to philosophize about this relationship,” Brooks said. “This relationship is best understood, appreciated, and discovered in work — a common endeavor.”

Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, left a Georgetown International Project on Cyber Engagement panel on “fake news” and propaganda yesterday 20 minutes before it was scheduled to end after heated exchanges with a group of students protesting his invitation.
Gorka was scheduled to depart the panel before 1:30 p.m., according to event organizers who moved the question-and-answer session forward to accommodate audience questions.
Gorka’s invitation to the seventh annual summit on the challenges of cyberspace, held by the Cyber Project, a School of Foreign Service graduate program, came into question by a group of student demonstrators, many of them members of the Jewish and Muslim communities, due to Gorka’s alleged connections to Hungarian neo-Nazi group Vitézi Rend and his positions on the Muslim community and religious profiling.
Students met privately with SFS Senior Associate Dean Anthony Arend (SFS ’80) the previous night to voice their concerns about inviting Gorka to speak at campus, given his views toward Islam and Judaism.
The demonstrators, who were not part of a formal group, gathered in protest outside the Leavey Conference Center event room prior to the 12:30 p.m. panel and stood toward the back of the room during the panel. Some held posters with messages opposing Gorka’s invitation, including “Gorka’s gotta go” and “reject anti-Semitism.”
After tense and raised-voice responses to four of the demonstrators’ questions during a question-and-answer period, Gorka left the panel at 1:27 p.m. before it was scheduled to end at 1:45 p.m. Gorka did not say why he was leaving, but said he would let other panelists answer questions.
“I am going to allow my colleagues to actually get questions about the issues on the table,” Gorka said, just before gathering his things and leaving.
Several media outlets, including Talking Points Memo and The Hill, reported that Gorka left out of exasperation at the protests and questions. A university spokesperson disputed this account, saying organizers told the university that Gorka informed them he would be leaving early prior to the event.
Cyber Project Director Catherine Lotrionte, who organized the event, said Gorka informed her of his early departure prior to the event.
“Mr. Gorka told me prior to the panel that he would have to leave at 1:30 p.m,” Lotrionte wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I informed the moderator of the panel.”
Arend said he was also informed of Gorka’s schedule change 15 minutes before the start of the event.
“I was told about 15 minutes or so before the panel began that Mr. Gorka would have to leave at 1:30.” Arend wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Our moderator was also aware of this early departure, and she began Q&A early in order to make sure there was ample time to be able to ask questions of the entire panel before his departure.”
In an interview with The Hoya, SFS Dean Joel Hellman said he was unaware of any prior plans for Gorka to leave early.
“I have no idea why he personally left. We made it very clear that if he was going to be in the panel, that we insist as we do with all these events, that he take questions from students and that students be given access to the room,” Hellman said. “He didn’t give us any explanation for why he left. I was told by somebody that he had a plane to catch. He didn’t mention that publicly.”
Hellman said he would not have chosen to invite Gorka himself, but that his invitation allowed students to confront him with their views.
“I would not have invited him, because I do not believe he had the expertise that I think was needed for that conference. My own view is that he does have a reputation for bombastic comments and chauvinistic views, in particular with reference to Islam. I think he has a history of troubling statements,” Hellman said. “But I think once he was invited, this was an opportunity for students to tell him exactly how they interpreted his remarks, and they did that.”
Gorka, who was hired to work on foreign policy by Trump in January, was first tied to neo-Nazis by a March report in The Forward, after a photo surfaced of Gorka wearing a medal associated with neo-Nazi connected group Vitézi Rend. Gorka strongly rebuked the protesters’ allegations of his involvement with the group, saying at the event he wore the medal in honor of his parents, who were imprisoned and tortured by the Nazi and communist regimes they resisted.
He said that the medal was awarded to his father by the Order of the Vitéz, a western, anti-communist organization that shared its name with an older organization. He said this story was turned against him due to his connection to the Trump administration and said the protestors were victims of fake news.
“Today, because I work for somebody named Donald J. Trump, that fact is used as part of a fake propaganda campaign that brought those people at the back of the room sadly to a point where they are the victims of fake news,” Gorka said. “Every single person holding a placard to protest my parents and myself, I challenge you now, go away and look at everything that I’ve said and written in the last 46 years of my life and find one sentence that is anti-Semitic or that is anti-Israeli.”
Gorka echoed press criticism by Trump and other administration members, casting himself as a victim of biased reporting. Trump has frequently tweeted criticism of major news media, including The New York Times, and called for tightening libel laws to be able to sue newspapers for false reports.
Andrew Meshnick (COL ’17), a member of the Jewish community on campus and one of the demonstrators, questioned Gorka about false claims by the Trump administration. Gorka refused to answer and challenged the validity of the question. Meshnick said after the panel ended that he was disappointed by Gorka’s unwillingness to engage with the students constructively.
“I was shocked that Mr. Gorka was so combative with his questioners. He was so uncomfortable answering questions and having his views subjected to public scrutiny. He was so uncomfortable that he left halfway through it and the gap in the middle of the stage spoke volumes,” Meshnick said. “He couldn’t even stand up to a bunch of 20-year-olds with signs and facts.”
Director for Jewish Life Rabbi Rachel Gartner praised the students for uniting for a common cause and engaging with the speaker.
“I was impressed with our students’ strength and perseverance and bravery, because it’s hard to do what they did,” Gartner said.
Gartner also commended the SFS for giving the students the opportunity and the encouragement to question Gorka.
“I want to commend them for their responsiveness and their going above and beyond and making it very clear to GUPD and to the students themselves that they wanted them to have the space to ask them any questions. In fact, they encouraged them to do so,” Gartner said.
“I think that’s really important too. It was a beautiful moment to feel like every part of Georgetown — campus ministry and university administration and students — rose to this occasion and came together in a very mature and caring way for each other.”
Aly Panjwani (SFS ’19), a member of the Muslim community on campus and one of the demonstrators, said that the event showcased the strong relationship between Georgetown’s Jewish and Muslim students, who grew closer as a result of the political climate ushered in by Trump’s rhetoric.
“This was a very good example of us really coming together for our collective liberation,” Panjwani said. “The same racist and bigoted ideas that affect the Muslim community also affect the Jewish community, so they go hand-in-hand. It was really powerful to see us come together for the same cause.”

I am not familiar with Gorka or any organization that he is alleged to be affiliated with. What are the troubling statements he supposedly made that the student’s had issues with? Why would he be “combative” if he were treated like a guest? Why would the university subject a guest speaker to protester’s? It couldn’t possibly be that he works for Trump?
This article leaves more questions than answers and if the man left because he was shouted down or felt intimidated than shame on Georgetown. People have the right to have a different opinion. It’s called freedom of speech which is in short supply on today’s college campuses!

Of course not! The students believe in free speech if it fits their political profile. Why wouldn’t Gorka be combative when confronted by abusive students holding a sign with a swaztika on it? They hate him because he is a “TRUMP” adviser and are still in denial that they lost the election.

President Donald Trump’s stated commitment to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict presents an opportunity for renewed negotiation between the two regions, according to two experts on the Middle Eastern dispute speaking Monday night.
The panel, convened by the Georgetown Bipartisan Pro-Israel Dialogue, featured former ambassador Dennis Ross, who has worked in multiple administrations as a key diplomat to Israel and Palestine, and Colin Kahl, former Vice President Joe Biden’s National Security Adviser and associate professor in the Security Studies Program at the School of Foreign Service, identified flaws in former President Barack Obama’s relations with Israel and urged Trump to inspire hope for a solution.
Ross said there was not any considerable progress toward Israeli-Palestinian peace in the Obama years, arguing that the Obama administration’s choice to make its objective to improve Israeli-Palestinian relations public was a key failure, especially negotiating Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights in Syria.
Obama promoted a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine throughout his presidency, and increased foreign military funding for the Israeli military from $2.9 billion in 2011 to $ 3.1 billion in 2012, while former secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and John Kerry criticized settlements.
“One of the things that was done early was to declare that there had to be a big freeze, including on natural growth, on settling,” Ross said. “Had the administration framed that issue differently, talking about a limitation of settlement activity, it would have put itself in a different position.”
Kahl countered Ross, stressing the Obama administration’s close relationship with Israeli security networks.
“Where Obama doesn’t get enough credit was just the unbelievable depth of the security and intelligence relationship that Obama fostered with Israel,” Kahl said.
Kahl said factors beyond the Obama administration’s control spoiled potential for progress, like the difference between Obama’s and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s personalities. This clash of personalities made negotiations difficult.
“For Obama to really be able to effectively put pressure on Netanyahu, he had to establish a certain degree of credibility with the Israeli public, which he never did,” Kahl said.
Both Ross and Kahl agreed that the current state of Israeli-Palestinian relations is bleak. Most recently, the Israeli military and Gaza-based militant group Hamas fought a three-monthlong war that killed 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis. Israel continues to blockade Gaza and build settlements in the West Bank and Golan Heights.
“When you look at where the Israelis and the Palestinians are, I’ve worked on this issue for 30 years, and there has never been a lower level of belief on either side than there is today,” Ross said.
Looking forward, the speakers held that, despite their initial doubts on Trump’s commitment to policy issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the new administration has an opportunity to bring both sides together.
Trump tasked his son-in-law Jared Kushner in January with leading negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders and has suggested he supports a two-state solution, even after endorsing a one-state framework at a Feb. 15 press conference with Netanyahu.
“You might not have predicted that this would be an issue that’s important to President Trump,” Ross said.
Still, Kahl warned that Trump may not care personally about the issue, which may scuttle long-term commitment. He pointed to recent administration moves in the United Nations and the State Department to urge Netanyahu to reduce Israeli settlements as examples of this inconsistency between rhetoric and policy.
“Some of the groups furthest to the right inside Israeli politics were quite bullish on Trump, hoping that in essence it would be open season for establishing a greater Israel,” Kahl said. “Actually the Trump administration has done a number of things to walk that perception back. They’ve actually done a fairly mild brushback pitch on settlements, suggesting that it’s not helpful, Trump himself suggesting the Israelis will have to make compromises.”
Leaving hard policy aside, the two speakers concluded that the biggest problem holding back peace, and the one that the Trump administration must address if it wants to stabilize the area, is the disillusionment of the public.
“The biggest danger we have is the complete absence of hope,” Kahl said. “I think there needs to be some way for this administration to rejuvenate hope for the prospects of two states.”

Anti-Semitic graffiti was found in a public restroom next to the Makóm Jewish gathering space in Leavey Center Saturday morning.
The graffiti, which includes a death threat, has been classified as a bias-related incident. The Georgetown University Police Department is currently investigating the incident, according to Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh.
According to a campuswide email from Interim Vice President for Mission and Ministry Rev. Howard Gray, S.J., and Vice President for Student Affairs Todd Olson today, a student found the graffiti written on a sticker on the door of a bathroom stall.
GUPD will increase patrols around campus and coordinate with the Metropolitan Police Department to surveil the neighborhood.
Matthew Sachs (COL ‘20) who first reported the graffiti to GUPD, said he discovered the note Saturday morning (Full disclosure: Sachs is a staff writer for The Hoya).
“At first I looked at the writing and thought, ‘This is totally unacceptable.’ But, I soon realized how incredibly disturbing and hateful this was to me and the people I shared it with,” Sachs wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I truly hope that in the future, our students can learn to accept all faiths and religious groups and uphold the honor and respect that Georgetown prides itself on.”
Gray and Olson condemned the graffiti in their email.
“As a Catholic and Jesuit university, we are committed to fostering a community that is welcoming to people of all faiths and that values diversity, inclusion and respect,” they wrote. “This act of anti-Semitism and hate is unacceptable, antithetical to what we stand for as a university, and has no place on our campus.”
The graffiti is the latest in a series of bias-related incidents reported on campus over the past year, and mirrors a rise in hate-related crimes in Washington, D.C.
In late March, GUPD investigated two separate cases of vandalism targeting Jewish, Muslim and Hindu communities in New South Hall and Village C West, where two swastikas were found scratched scratched into the interior walls of an elevator. The swastikas were painted over by the following morning.
Two separate bias reports were reported the week of March 20 regarding incidents of Muslim and Hindu flyers being ripped down and vandalized from chaplain-in-residence bulletin boards.
The incident also follows a semester marked by other challenges for Jewish student groups. On April 24, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, organizers of the Cyber Project conference in the School of Foreign Service Masters program invited White House deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka to speak on a panel on cybersecurity and propaganda. Gorka’s appearance was protested by Jewish, Muslim and LGBT students opposing his positions on the Muslim community, religious profiling, and alleged affiliations with a Hungarian neo-Nazi connected group, Vitézi Rend.
Gray and Olson reaffirmed the university’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity in the email today.
“We stand with our Jewish community and any campus community that experiences acts of bias,” they wrote. “Together we condemn acts of hate and celebrate our global community, which is made stronger by our religious, cultural and international diversity.”
Pugh said that anyone with information about the incident should contact GUPD.
This is a developing story. The post will be updated as more information becomes available.

Exactly what did the graffiti say? Is this the work of hate or a pro Israeli group that want’s to get a little sympathetic publicity? How can anyone get worked up over something written on a bathroom wall? Is this even newsworthy? So now the GUPD is going to put extra patrols on bathrooms just in case the dreaded graffiti monster makes another attempt? If there is any possible terrorist threat call the FBI or homeland security and do a real investigation!

Georgetown will not invest in private prison companies in keeping with the university’s Socially Responsible Investing Policy, the university announced yesterday.
The board’s Committee on Finance and Administration, which oversees the university’s management of financial resources, accepted the recommendation of the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, announced in March, for the university to avoid investments in private prison companies. CISR makes recommendations to the board on ethical investment policies and consists of 12 members, including faculty, administrators and three students.
The university will “encourage” its external investment managers to “avoid investing in the companies,” according to a university news release Thursday, which said the decision continues an existing practice.
The decision follows the board’s approval of a broad SRI policy in June, which established a general ethical framework for the university’s investment policy. The guidelines broadly require the university to consider the social and environmental impact of companies in which it invests.
Though the SRI Policy requires the university to make “reasonable efforts” toward these goals, it did not strictly require any new divestments, nor did it mandate any policies that would compromise the university’s financial interests. Investments discouraged under the policy include companies involved in providing abortion services, as well as companies deemed to violate “human dignity.”
The recommendation that the university establish a policy of “no direct investment” in private prisons passed in March by a majority vote of the CISR. The recommendation followed a divestment proposal submitted in January by three students: Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17), Sophie Bauerschmidt Sweeney (COL ’17) and Salma Khamis (SFS ’17).
The students’ proposal advocated divestment from “all private prison companies and companies that sustain private prisons,” as well as divestment from “companies that knowingly and consistently enable and profit” from the “violent Israeli occupation of Palestine.”
CISR adopted a narrower version of the students’ proposal on private prisons, recommending divestment from private prison companies themselves but excluding any judgment on investing in any other companies that are themselves invested in private prisons.
“The Committee determined it is inconsistent with Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit values to hold investments in companies that profit from the incarceration of human beings,” a CISR memo announcing the recommendation read.
While partially supporting the students’ petition on private prisons, the CISR rejected the divestment from Israeli occupation, citing Georgetown community members’ “many different perspectives” on how to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and doubts that the university’s divestment would be an “effective tactic” to end hostilities.

Hey Jeff, our proposal did not include “divestment from Israel” as you stated above. We proposed a very targeted divestment from companies that contribute to the many types of violence against the Palestinians living under occupation. None of the companies are Israeli. This is a gross mischaracterization that the Hoya has consistently propogated since you began covering the CISR process. We worked very hard on this proposal and wish that people would take the time to read the details before framing it as “anti-Israel.” More information can be found at gufreeorg.wordpress.com.

Student activists who pushed Georgetown University to commit not to invest in private prison companies now say the university is unfairly taking the credit for their activism in an Oct. 5 news release announcing the new policy.
The university announced the policy after a committee of the university’s board of directors accepted a March recommendation of the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, which makes recommendations to the board on ethical investment policies. Under the new policy, the university will encourage its external investment managers to avoid investments in private prison companies.
What the university’s announcement mentioned only briefly, however, was how the proposal came to the CISR in the first place: It was submitted by Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17), Sophie Bauerschmidt Sweeney (COL ’17) and Salma Khamis (SFS ’17), and accompanied by a three-month campaign launched last December by the student group Georgetown University Forming a Radically Ethical Endowment.
Abdelfadeel said the university’s statement took credit for the change while only briefly alluding to student involvement.
“Understating the fact that this was a call from students is indicative of a trend of the administration being unresponsive to the demands of the wider community and then taking credit for the work once it has become socially and/or financially appropriate for them to do the right things,” Abdelfadeel said.
The release made one reference to the students’ involvement, saying the CISR “reviewed a student proposal that included a request that the university divest from the private prison industry.”
“After finding investing in the private prison industry to be inconsistent with Georgetown’s commitment to socially responsible investing – which is reflected in the new SRI policy, CISR submitted a recommendation to the board that supported this strategy,” the release said.
A discussion of the activism that led up to the decision is lacking from the campus conversation, according to Christian Morris (COL ’19), a student organizer for GU F.R.E.E.
“I feel like it was worked for,” Morris said. “I want to bring it back to the fact that student activism, student pressure and conversations are happening. I haven’t heard anything about the demonstrations we did last year, or the events that we disrupted, or the proposal we submitted through Georgetown’s bureaucratic loopholes.”
A university spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
This is not the first time students have criticized the university for taking credit for activists’ efforts.
Lily Ryan (COL ’18), a member of the workers’ rights student activist group Georgetown Solidarity Committee, said the administration failed to acknowledge GSC’s role in a 2016 dispute with the university over its licensing contract with Nike.
Students associated with the GSC staged a 35-hour sit-in last December in the office of University President John J. DeGioia, demanding the university cut its contract with Nike unless the company agreed to allow independent workers’ rights inspections of its factories. After hours of negotiations between students and university administrators, the university ultimately agreed to the students’ demands and allowed the contract to expire at the end of the year. The parties struck a new contract in August which included an agreement to allow regular, independent inspections of Nike supplier factories.
A university news release announcing the new contract in August does not mention GSC, the sit-in or student activism. One line in the eighth paragraph of the release notes the university “engaged with faculty and student leaders” while negotiating the contract.
Ryan said the framing of the university’s statement disregards the pivotal role of student activists in pressuring the university to negotiate the new contract.
“What troubles me is that, as usual, there is no mention of the extensive efforts that students put into pushing Georgetown into a decision,” Ryan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While I can’t speak for all students or student activists on campus, I don’t think we do it for the glamor or for the recognition by university administrators but I think it erases the work done by students, in the case of GU F.R.E.E., it was work done in large part by queer students and students of color.”
Ryan said the way the university represents student activism is important for reasons other than conferring credit.
“The stories we tell about victories and failures are important and it can be hard to tell stories about student activism when the activists are left out of the narrative,” Ryan wrote. “I knew when the statement was released about private prisons that it had taken time and effort on the part of a committed group of students, but I know that so many students don’t know, and that can be detrimental to promoting a culture in which students can engage in activism.”
As for the future, Abdelfadeel noted the work of divestment advocates is unfinished. The original group’s 2016 proposal to the CISR was more broad than the one enacted by the board of directors this month, also including a request for divestment from companies invested in private prisons, rather than only private prisons themselves.
“The original proposal to the CISR proposed divestment from private prisons and the wider industry that sustains it,” Abdelfadeel said. “It would be great to see a commitment from the university regarding the wider private prison industry.”
The proposal also called on the university to divest from any companies that benefitted financially from the Israeli occupation of Palestine, a request that was rejected by the CISR.
Abdelfaleel said there are common threads in the social implications of private prisons and the occupation.
“We found common themes of state violence — black people living and dying under the United States’ white supremacy and Palestinians living and dying under Israeli settler colonialism and apartheid. Moreover, there is an overlap in companies that empower the private prison industry and the illegal occupation,” Abdelfaleel said.
GU F.R.E.E. also continues to call for greater transparency in Georgetown’s investment records and promotes general public consciousness of the university’s investment policies.
Morris, meanwhile, said he hoped that this decision would prompt the university to look at other instances of state violence and adapt its investment policies accordingly.
“I hope there is something sustaining from the divestment of prisons, not like, ‘OK, we did it; it’s done,’” Morris said. “This should only be the beginning of Georgetown’s broader divestment movement.”

Matthew 6: “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others.”
This article is ridiculous and only confirms the fears of those on the right that the only thing leftists or those seeking social justice really want is self-righteousness and recognition. To make things worse, somehow this, of all matters, made the front page. What a superfluous complaint.

“Hard-headedness and empathy” — this seemingly paradoxical combination of qualities informed the foreign policy of former President Bill Clinton (SFS ’68) at a time when the United States was surging as a unilateral world power, argued foreign policy experts Monday in Copley Formal Lounge.
The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union saw the erosion of the bilateral system of international relations that governed the post-World War II world, poising the United States to increase its influence under Clinton’s lead. Clinton’s extraversion and persistence helped to achieve that goal, according to three experts who worked with his administration.
Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and former Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott comprised a panel on Clinton’s vision of the world and the foreign policy agenda it inspired. The event, co-sponsored by the School of Foreign Service and moderated by SFS Dean Joel Hellman, was part of the “Clinton 25: Georgetown Reflects on the Vision of Bill Clinton” symposium hosted by the Institute of Politics and Public Service.
As an SFS graduate and a Rhodes scholar, Clinton had studied international relations extensively by the time he arrived at the Oval Office. Talbott said Clinton’s focus was ensuring lasting stability.
“He came into office wanting to do everything he could to make sure that the Cold War was over and that post-Soviet Russia would be able to succeed,” Talbott said.
Albright said that through the 1994 Partnership for Peace, a NATO program aimed at increasing trust in European and former Soviet states, Clinton showed Russia a sign of respect.
At the negotiating table, the panelists said, Clinton pursued a “mission rich in diplomacy and engagement.” He complemented this mission with a proclivity for empathy, Zedillo said, citing Clinton’s support for the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement to improve the region’s economy.
NAFTA, which set up a free trade zone among Canada, the United States and Mexico, is currently being renegotiated by the administration of President Donald Trump, who called the agreement “the worst trade deal” during his 2016 presidential campaign.
Clinton believed it was in the national interest to bring financial stability to the region, Zedillo said. The former president sidestepped the U.S. Congress in 1995 to authorize a $20 billion loan to Mexico through the Department of the Treasury.
Clinton’s administration is also remembered for the 2000 Camp David summit among the American, Israeli and Palestinian premiers, during which the parties attempted to broker territorial disputes, the status of refugees and the elimination of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
Despite not being able to reach a watershed agreement, Clinton aimed to foster understanding between the parties, according to Albright, who participated in the 13-day negotiations.
“He made it a point of sitting down both with [Palestinian Authority] Chairman [Yasser] Arafat and with [Israeli] Prime Minister Ehud Barak and made them put themselves into the shoes of the other party,” Albright said. “That was kind of his way of saying, ‘We have to solve this together; it had to be win-win and not zero-sum.’”
Perhaps one of the Clinton administration’s most notable foreign policy moments remains the 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea, through which an international consortium was set to replace North Korea’s plutonium reactor with two light-water reactors.
The talks broke down after incoming Secretary of State Colin Powell of the George W. Bush administration “got hauled into the White House” and was told the negotiations must cease, according to Albright.
The Clinton administration also drew heavy criticism from its decision not to intervene in Rwanda, where 800,000 members of the Tutsi ethnic group were massacred by Hutus in 1994.
Talbott, who went on to preside over the Brookings Institution for 15 years, said Clinton was also instrumental in convincing former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to de-escalate conflict at the India-Pakistan border in 1999. The former president spent his Fourth of July weekend negotiating the demilitarization of the border, averting possible nuclear war.
But it is impossible to encompass eight years of foreign policy in one three-person panel, Hellman said. The conversation thus “wasn’t so much an assessment of the era as an assessment of the man” and how Clinton used his global influence.
In international relations parlance, this analysis of an individual’s vision has a name: the great man or woman theory, which states that foreign policy can be explained by the impact of individuals.
“Russia had a critical role to play in the world and … how it used its strength and potential was largely a function first of [former Russian President Boris] Yeltsin and then [President Vladimir] Putin taking it in a different direction,” Hellman said, echoing Talbott’s assessment that appointing Putin was Yeltsin’s biggest regret.
For Albright, the foreign affairs lesson from the Clinton presidency is the linkage between international engagement and domestic policy gains: The United States needed to become an “indispensable nation” in the eyes of the world to advance its own interests.
“What I’m worried about is that we are about to become the dispensable nation, where nobody thinks that we do have a role to play,” Albright said. “I would hope that the president, the current one, would understand that what he is trying to accomplish requires the United States to be engaged in a respectful way and stop tweeting.”

Pope Francis welcomed seven Georgetown students and four faculty members to Vatican City last weekend for an international conference on nuclear disarmament.
The conference, hosted by the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, took place on Nov. 10 and 11. Over the two days, the Georgetown delegation heard from 11 Nobel Peace Laureates, representatives from the United Nations and NATO, diplomats and acclesiastical officials on their approaches to reaching a world free of nuclear weapons.
Fr. Drew Christiansen, S.J., a professor of ethics and global human development and a senior research fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, led the Georgetown delegation.
Christiansen, who served as one of the chief advisers to the Vatican’s work at the United Nations Force, spoke at the conference on the urgent need, in the long term, to rid the globe of nuclear arms.
“Nuclear weapons must be treated as a wholly different class of weapons,” Christiansen said at the conference. “We should cease to imagine them as tools we can manage but rather as a curse we must banish.”
Representatives from Israel, Jordan and Japan also spoke on the negative impacts of nuclear weapons worldwide. Masako Wada, a survivor of the Nagasaki nuclear attack, gave a personal testimony.
The Catholic Church opposes the use and possession of nuclear weapons and has advocated for full abolishment of nuclear weapons. In April 2015, Pope Francis began to push for active disarmament of nuclear weapons, hosting international conferences to discuss methods of global nuclear disarmament.
Pope Francis spoke on the first day of the conference, noting that the threat, use and possession of nuclear weapons is reprehensible.
“Weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, create nothing but a false sense of security,” Pope Francis said. “They cannot constitute the basis for peaceful coexistence between members of the human family which must rather be inspired by an ethics of solidarity.”
Nuclear experts noted the need for students around the world to get involved in the commitment to eliminating nuclear arms. Student delegations from Catholic University and Notre Dame University were also in attendance, an outgrowth of the organizers’ effort to involve young people in the initiative.
Daniel Rosenberg (SFS ’18), who attended the conference, noticed the positive feedback from the speakers on the attendance of the students at the conference.
“Everyone was super excited that we were there just because one of the things that they’ve really been focusing on is involving the youth,” Rosenberg said.
Students from the Georgetown delegation had the opportunity to engage in one-on-one conversations with some of the speakers. Hunter Estes (SFS ’19) spoke briefly with Pope Francis.
“The opportunity seems surreal, while particularly interested in the issue, being Catholic myself and
having the opportunity to actually meet the Pope and talk to him for a few minutes was easily one of the best moments of my life,” Estes said.
Many of the students in attendance, who were invited to go on the trip because of their academic interests in international security, were inspired to hear the leaders in their fields speak on pressing international security issues.
“My interest in terms of academic and security stuff at Georgetown and what I’m studying is very much motivated by my faith, and my hope to help people around the world,” Estes said. “To see that so tangibly being carried out by the leaders of my church feels like a dream, it still does.”
Ricardo Mondolfi (SFS ’19) said he appreciated hearing from leaders with different opinions about approaches to nuclear disarmament.
“It was an impactful academic experience, it provided me the opportunity to listen to a different perspective on nuclear weapons that I had gotten here,” Mondolfi said. “I got a much deeper understanding of what the Church’s position is, which is important both as a person and as a Catholic.”
For the Georgetown students who attended the conference, the experience of hearing distinguished lecturers speak on nuclear disarmament will impact their remaining time on the Hilltop and as they continue into their professional lives.
“So often as students, we spend four years working on a set of topics, but at times we don’t really see how it plays out in real life on the world stage,” Estes said. “Especially as a [School of Foreign Service] student, this was the nerdiest opportunity available and was just like an absolute dream.”

A divisive, us-versus-them approach to debating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict impedes progress, argued pro-Israel activist Chloé Valdary at a Nov. 28 discussion.
The U.S. conversation regarding the conflict, a decadeslong struggle between Israelis and Palestinians over the two sides’ competing claims to lands controlled by Israel, pits proponents of Israeli security and self-determination against advocates for the rights of Palestinians.
Valdary, who works as director of partnerships and a Shillman Fellow at the educational film production company Jerusalem U, said an oppressor-versus-oppressed framing misrepresents the conflict.
In an oppressor-versus-oppressed mindset, Valdary said, morality only supports victims. She said Americans who supported Zionism out of a shared sense of oppression or intersectionality could no longer view Israel as relatable or even “moral” once it won statehood.
“If you see history through this very narrow framework, anything that falls out of these boxes, you can no longer fight for, you can no longer stand for. It’s a worldview, in my opinion, that doesn’t allow for complexity,” Valdary said. “Instead of having that paradigm, why don’t we just empower everyone?”
She criticized the concept of intersectionality for reinforcing categorical labels of the “us-versus-them” binary.
“Intersectionality is responding to categorization, but it is not, in my mind, challenging the categories,” Valdary said. “It is reinforcing the categories, in a sense, because it is making claims that I, as a person of color, have most assuredly experienced ‘x’ at the hands of someone who was white by virtue of being in the categories, in the skin colors that we have.”
Instead of intersectionality, Valdary proposed restorative justice, or repairing harm caused by misdeeds, and her “theory of enchantment,” which is the promotion of constructive discussions about differences to build compassion for a common humanity, as alternative paradigms through which to understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Valdary said she hopes to transcend the “us-versus-them binary” through this approach.
“Restorative justice tries to transcend that [us-versus-them] and ask the question, ‘How can we heal both of our communities?’ That is something I’m very much attracted to,” Valdary said.
If Israelis and Palestinians could stop seeing their losses as the other group’s gains, they could move toward healing, Valdary said.
Georgetown Israel Alliance President Sean Lerner (SFS ’20) and Vice President Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20) organized the event, hosted by the GIA and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, to bridge what Lerner called a “racialized” divide in the Israeli-Palestinian discussion on campus.
“I’ve known about Chloé for a while. She’s pretty popular in the young pro-Israel world, especially on social media,” Lerner said. “We also recognized that there was a sort of element around the discussion of Israel-Palestine on this campus that was racialized in a way; there was a divide in the community.”
Valdary encouraged students to analyze the dilemmas Israelis and Palestinians face while recognizing that some of them are currently irreconcilable and to engage with organizations that bring together contrasting perspectives.
“We, as students and educators, need to volunteer for those organizations, seek out those organizations that are bringing Israelis and Palestinians together and creating dialogue,” Valdary said. “Dialogue that might not have all the answers, but… is much more interested in saying, ‘Even though you and I disagree about x, y and z, our goal is to foster compassion and empathy in the midst of profound disagreement.’”
Ultimately, Valdary said she hopes to redefine how people conceptualize the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“We are so much more than these weird, objectified terminologies. I think we have to enter the conversation with the desire to lean in toward the other, so that we can see ourselves in them and see them in ourselves,” Valdary said.

What a wonderful oncept. Unfortunately, given the tribal stone-age mentality of one of the parties, it won’t work. The idea depends on an assumption of reasonableness by both parties to the conflict. History has shown time and again (we have such a penchant for ignoring the lessons of history) that one of the parties will enter the dialogue with a hidden agenda that assumes any ‘give’ by the other side is a sign of weakness (difficult to accept that an inhuman society that glorifies martyrdom and terrorism can be reasonable) and fall right back into the original paradigm of tribal conflict.

This article is shallow and makes the situation in the Middle East sound so complex and conveys a purely emotional and unrealistic “lets understand each other over coffee” solution, while using such interstesting terms that sound so sophisticated, educated, and knowledgeable. Do people just make up words today?
 First, this is not about “Israelis & Palistinians”, but “muslims vs Jews”. Its that simple. For over 6 years I have lived in Israel as  non-Jewish independent journalist and travelled the details of the country, know the the history,  been on the front lines of war, infiltrated terror groups, and having shown first hand via interviews that young and old muslims, in and out of Israel, openly call for the destruction of the Jewish State. Might I also add that these everyday muslims are not islamic leadership or part of a militant group like hamas or hezbollah.
Most Isrseli’s, especially Israeli born Jews, clearly understand the intent of their islamic enemies desire to destroy them from the river to the sea and historically speaking whenever there was a CALL for peace it was simply a muslim moment to build up to the next attack on the Jews. Whenever there was a treaty signed and historically owned Jewish land was given away it would be used as a platform for miltant activity to attack Israel.
Hamas and Hezbollah hold no countries/people hostage. No military exists without the support of the civilain population. muslims encourage, cheer, and groom their children to join these 2 groups for the sake of allah as directed by the koran. As well, if not to join militant islam openly, but to act independtly to bring glory to the prophet and further global domination.
I would venture to say, with great assurance, that the people involved in the article speak ONLY from a Western perspective and know nothing of islam, the koran, the intimate details of the culture, language, history, and mentality of the players involved. I do appreciate and respect advocacy for Israel, but when one continues to use “fake terms” that promote the lie of “palistinians”, when you have never attend the funeral of soldiers, or sat with vicitms of terror for 6 years then you bring nothing to the table realistically as far as a solution

Chloe knows the history and reality and I admire her efforts, but as the others have stated: there are no 2 parties with a happy outcome.  As long as the Jews violate the dhimma and refuse to die or return to subjugated dhimmi status, muslims will wage war.  The muslims will not mind dying (unless they did not succeed in killing Jews along the way) and the Pentagon/EU backed leaders of the muslims reward the killers of Jews.
Western and European leaders have full power to defund and destroy both hamas and fatah, but deliberately choose not to.
These basic facts render the kumbaya efforts at harmony and peace a waste of time.

More than two months after a string of anti-Semitic vandalism incidents in two residence halls shook campus, the Georgetown University Police Department has not identified a suspect.
Swastikas were found painted in an LXR Hall elevator and bathroom on at least three occasions in September shortly after a swastika was carved into an elevator of Village C West. GUPD increased security and installed cameras around LXR in response to the vandalism.
GUPD Police Chief Jay Gruber said campus police have conducted extensive investigations and interviews to identify the person responsible, but the investigation is ongoing.
Jessica Keller (COL ’20), president of J Street U Georgetown, a pro-Israel campus group, said that the administration should have taken stronger action against the anti-Semitic sentiment on campus.
“The administration should do more to forcibly condemn the incidences of anti-Semitism that continue to plague our campus. It appears that actions of anti-Semitism and misogyny have only been bolstered by the inability of our society to condemn this hateful rhetoric, and I believe that more must be done, both by the administration and by other student organizations, to combat this threat,” Keller wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Rev. Mark Bosco, S.J., vice president for mission and ministry, and Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs, sent a campuswide email in response to the swastikas found carved in VCW, and University President John J. DeGioia sent another campuswide email in response to the swastikas found painted in LXR.
The emails condemned the acts of vandalism and promised those responsible would be held accountable for their actions.
Keller said although the university could do more, she appreciates its responses to the acts of vandalism.
“The administration’s efforts to vocalize their condemnation of anti-Semitism and efforts to stand alongside the Jewish community (i.e. attending Shabbat services in solidarity) went a long way in reassuring our Jewish student community that their safety and sense of community on campus are university priorities,” Keller wrote.
Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20), vice president of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, said the university addressed the anti-Semitic vandalism well but should have continued its campuswide updates to maintain Georgetown’s awareness of anti-Semitism on campus. The university initially sent campuswide announcements after each incident but stopped in September after incidents accelerated, apparently in response to widespread attention.
“Once students, faculty, and alumni stopped hearing about the swastikas, they wrongly assumed they had stopped appearing,” Larkin wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Larkin said the swastikas drawn in dorms reflect a larger problem with anti-Semitism on campus.
“It is important that people recognize that anti-Semitism is a bigger problem than just some graffiti. Swastikas are only the most glaring kind of anti-Semitism at Georgetown,” Larkin said.
Hasaan Munim (SFS ’18), president of the Georgetown University Muslim Students Association, said the Muslim community stood in solidarity with Jewish students at Georgetown and strove to provide support by attending Shabbat services and co-hosting interfaith dialogues.
“The immediate reaction was to look for ways to support members of the Georgetown community who are Jewish,” Munim said.
Georgetown University Student Association Press Secretary Aaron Bennett (COL ’19) said that GUSA condemns acts of hate such as the anti-Semitic vandalism and continues to support Jewish students at Georgetown.
“GUSA holds firm that hate is not welcome at Georgetown, and we stand in solidarity with members of our Jewish community, as well as all other communities on our campus affected by these incidents,” Bennett wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Since the first swastikas appeared in VCW and LXR, many groups at Georgetown have organized events to raise awareness about anti-Semitism on campus and provide spaces for conversations around diversity and inclusion on campus. GUSA partnered with the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity and Affirmative Action to organize a lunch event called “Fostering and Promoting Interreligious Dialogue” on Nov. 2, according to Bennett.
GUSA, J Street U, the Jewish Student Association and other Jewish student groups on campus organized a “What’s a Hoya” event to discuss anti-Semitism at Georgetown. JSA President Claire Goldberg (COL ’19) said the group intends to continue spreading awareness about anti-Semitism at Georgetown.
Nash Hale (COL ’20), a resident of LXR, said many people in the dorm have moved on from the anti-Semitic vandalism.
“At this point, it’s been a few months since the last swastika. Everyone has moved on and put those events in the past,” Hale wrote in an email to The Hoya.

American values are not always so dissimilar from those in conservative Muslim countries, posits Gary Wasserman (SFS ’66), a former professor of government at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Doha, Qatar, in his recent book reflecting on his experiences living and working in Doha.
Wasserman taught from 2006 to 2014, joining the SFS-Q faculty just one year after the institution opened its doors.
Since his return to the United States from Doha, Wasserman has dedicated his time to writing his book, “The Doha Experiment: Arab Kingdom, Catholic College, Jewish Teacher,” which was published Nov. 14 and discusses his eight years in the region.
Wasserman highlights his efforts to reach across boundaries and describes his experience administering a liberal education in a region of the world unfamiliar to many Americans. Through personal anecdotes, Wasserman discusses not only the lessons he sought to teach but also how his interactions with his students changed his own understanding of the world.
The Hoya sat down with Wasserman to learn more about his experience abroad.
You have previously mentioned the unusual nature of teaching as a Jewish professor at a Catholic school in a predominantly Muslim country, so what inspired you to go to Qatar? 
I had been working mostly in Washington as a political consultant, then I taught for a year in China, and I enjoyed the experience of teaching overseas. It was frankly easier to get a job overseas, and I also thought this would be an interesting, challenging opportunity. Now, unfortunately, when I told my family and friends about this, they all looked at me like I was crazy, you know?
This was a few years after 9/11, and a Jewish professor going to the Middle East to teach sounded to many of them like an act of lunacy, and I began to wonder about my own sanity. I talk in the book about how you have to start out with a kind of “You’re going to do what?” to getting to know real people on the ground and finding that the categories that we use for understanding people we don’t know very well tend to fall away.
Your book talks about the tension between Qatar’s traditional society and Georgetown’s mission of liberal education. Can you elaborate on that?
Georgetown was set up for foreign service, essentially to educate bureaucrats in becoming administrators, but Georgetown itself — the administrators and teachers — saw themselves as providing a liberal education.
Grounding in philosophy and economics and history and politics, which was more oriented to educating the whole person, they weren’t trying to train students into a certain profession. They were trying to educate young people in this tradition of liberal education. There was that disagreement and a kind of implicit misunderstanding, but I think the Qataris and the Qatari leaders were very welcoming of what Georgetown was doing, including courses like the “Problem of God” for instance, and respecting Georgetown’s scholars’ willingness to take on what they were doing. They gave Georgetown a lot of scope to do what they were going to do.
You also talked about how Qatar was very different from its other Middle Eastern counterparts in terms of its willingness to globalize and its acceptance of Western cultural attitudes. Do you think that these schools that are coming in are a positive force in this regard? 
Qatar and many of the nations are in flux. They’re very much sorting through what parts of their tradition they want to retain and what parts have to be adapted to the modern world. We’re not exactly the epitome of liberal societies now in the world. I think all countries adapt themselves in different ways to different pressures, different interests and different values. They are going through that adaptation, and I think they’re doing it with the resources they have. They have a lot of resources, a lot of money, and they have an enlightened leadership that I think understands that Qatar is going to prosper and survive in the world, and in the future they’re going to have to adapt to that globalized world.
Can you share one of those experiences that you thought was one of the more interesting ones you had there or that struck you? 
I had a student in one of my classes who was always kind of bringing up Israel or Zionism in an international relations class; it seemed to always go back to the question of the involvement of Zionists in a little bit of conspiratorial stuff he was thinking. And it came out frequently in class, and we talked about it in private, in quiet, and of course, he didn’t quite see it that way. I suggested he look more into the topic, but I didn’t think it was a very successful discussion that we had.
About a year or two later, he came back, and he had spent a semester at Georgetown’s main campus, and he had taken a class in Jewish civilization. He came back and he said, “You know, I never would have taken this class if I hadn’t been in your course.” It was one of those unexpected benefits. You have those kind of encounters that you don’t think are having an impact, but in fact, they do.
You mention you wanted this to be a positive, vital force in the region. Do you think we’re succeeding? 
I would say it’s incomplete. I think it’s succeeding in that it’s surviving and it’s adapting to the environment, and it’s succeeding in that it’s continuing to educate students. They’re continuing to graduate, and they’re continuing to think well of their experience at Georgetown and influencing the broader society.
I think it is succeeding. Whether it succeeds sufficiently and whether it is preserved remains to be seen, and part of it is how people kind of engage in what’s going on and spread some of the liberal ideas. Does press freedom expand in the society? Do women have more rights than they now have? There will be different markers, and I don’t think you go in there thinking your university is going to change the broader society or the broader region, but you do hope that over time, some of the ideas you’ve talked about have an impact.
What is something that you would like to see mentioned, or focused on more? 
I would like to see more interaction between the campuses. I’d like to see more people not interacting on the basis of religion, but just more connections between the main campus and Doha, between the very active Jewish civilization groups on the campus and more student activities between the campuses — a little bit of understanding of the students — because I think the students there have something to offer the main campus and vice versa, kind of getting away from these stereotypes, getting to know real people.
Is there anything you would like to add? Anything you think is important to you or to the book or to your experience in Doha?
What we’re doing in Doha is lowering walls. I think we came with the idea of being a modern missionary. We were going to deliver the truth in our campuses, and I think over time we’ve seen the importance of listening and trying to lower the walls a little bit between us and the rest of the region.

I did not know Gary very well when we were both undergraduates, except for the classes we shared and his role as the humor columnist for the East Campus student magazine.  I am very impressed with what he has done since we graduated, and especially with his work in Qatar, trying to “lower the walls” (in his phrase) between people of different cultures and political persuasions.

Ben Shapiro, an American conservative political commentator, is slated to speak at Georgetown University in an event hosted by the Georgetown University College Republicans and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund on March 21.
The event is planned to be a discussion on free speech located in Lohrfink Auditorium. Admission to the event is free to Georgetown students and faculty members.
Shapiro is a syndicated columnist, lawyer and author of seven books. He is the editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, a conservative news website, and host of the podcast, ‘The Ben Shapiro Show.” He previously contributed to Breitbart News as an editor-at-large until resigning in March 2016.
A frequent college campus lecturer, Shapiro made a name for himself as a critic of former President Barack Obama, mainstream media, Hollywood and identity politics, all of which he has written polemic books on.
GUCR President Emerita Allie Williams (SFS ’19) said the organization supports Shapiro’s advocacy for free speech and that having him on campus will be an important opportunity for students to discuss these ideas. (Full disclosure: Williams is a member of The Hoya’s editorial board.)
“For years GUCR members have expressed the desire to host Mr. Shapiro, a conservative commentator whom many college students admire for his free speech advocacy and unabashed conservatism,” Williams wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We feel that this event is a tremendous opportunity for the Georgetown community to engage with Mr. Shapiro, whom many label as the voice of the conservative millennial movement, and demonstrate our commitment to free speech as Hoyas.”
Current GUCR President Jake Lyons (COL ’20) said members of his organization have been pushing for an event with Shapiro for years, and they are excited for their work to finally come to fruition.
“Our members have expressed that they have wanted to host Mr. Shapiro at Georgetown for a number of years now, and we are proud to finally make it happen,” Lyons wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Shapiro’s views on topics ranging from Israel to the status of transgender individuals have made him the source of public debate on college campuses. Student protesters have labelled his rhetoric as hate speech in the past and have called for the removal of his speaking platform, as California State University, Los Angeles students attempted to do in 2016.
Failing to prevent him from speaking, Cal State LA students blocked classmates from entering the building where Shapiro was scheduled to speak. Students formed human blockades, started fights and pulled a fire alarm when his speech began.
Aiden Johnson (COL ’19), chair of the Lecture Fund, said the event is an opportunity for students to engage with ideas that may differ from their own.
“The Lecture Fund continues to exist as a non-partisan organization that deeply values the free exchange of ideas on our campus,” Johnson said. “As is the case with every event that we are involved in, our organization’s support is not an endorsement of any set of beliefs or viewpoints, but rather a commitment to giving students the chance to interact with a speaker and to develop their own beliefs about the topic being discussed.”
Protests of Shapiro’s speech at the University of California, Berkeley in September 2017 were relatively peaceful, though campus police took extensive preventative measures following the violent reaction to a speech by Milo Yiannopoulos, a more contentious speaker, planned in February. Security for the Shapiro event cost $600,000 and resulted in nine arrests of protesters, four of whom were arrested for carrying banned weapons, according to a Sept. 15 article in the Los Angeles Times.
Lyons said GUCR has coordinated with both GUPD and Shapiro’s security team to ensure the safety of attendees and protesters, and has planned for a specified “expression space for protest outside of the venue.”
In the interest of encouraging dialogue between those with dissenting opinions, Williams said that GUCR has invited members of dissenting organizations and has set aside reserved seating for two leaders of these student groups.
“I also want to note that, while Mr. Shapiro was among the first individuals to denounce the alt-right movement as racist and anti-Semitic, we recognize that there are several groups on campus who have views and beliefs that contradict with his own,” Williams wrote. “That is why last night I reached out to these groups, providing them with a ‘heads up’ that the event is taking place, and inviting their membership to attend the event and challenge Mr. Shapiro during the Q&A.”
Lyons corroborated the statement, saying that discussion between those with differing opinions helps make events like this important.
“My predecessor, Allie Williams, and I believe that some of the strongest conversations on Georgetown’s campus are the ones in which students are given the opportunity to examine, question, and hear from speakers,” Lyons said. “We hope that all Georgetown students will help us make this event as impactful and well-rounded as it can be.”

Georgetown University’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine hosted its annual Israel Apartheid Week from April 2 to 6 to draw attention to the 70 years of Palestinian popular resistance against the continued “process of dispossession” and conflict in the Israel-Palestine region since the 1948 Israeli War of Independence.
In its 14th year, Israel Apartheid Week is an international movement on college campuses that aims to provide a platform for events in cities to raise awareness of “Israel’s apartheid system over the Palestinian people and to build support for the growing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement,” according to the IAW website. The Palestinian-led BDS movement calls for international companies and governments to withdraw support for, divest from and sanction Israeli companies “that are involved in the violation of Palestinian human rights,” according to the BDS movement website.
Andrew Kadi, a BDS movement leader, was invited to explain the BDS movement to students April 3. BDS encourages the international community to stop “a regime of settler colonialism, apartheid and occupation” by exerting financial pressure on Israel, according to the BDS website.
Part of a nationwide federation of Palestinian advocacy groups, Georgetown’s SJP organized events to support the ongoing dialogue about self-determination of Palestinian people.
Other events SJP hosted throughout the week included a film screening of “The Wanted 18,” an animated documentary about the efforts of Palestinians to start a small local dairy industry, and a talk by Georgetown department of anthropology professor Laurie King, who discussed the importance of Palestinian media and journalism. King co-founded a Palestine-focused, online news source called the Electronic Intifada in 2001. SJP also tabled and wrote letters to Palestinian political prisoners in Red Square.
SJP President Ahmad Al-Husseini (NHS ’20) said Israel Apartheid Week, which has taken place on Georgetown’s campus since 2011, is SJP’s number one priority for the year.
 
“Our goal in doing this week is simply just raising awareness and reminding the world that this struggle still exists and is not going away until immediate and severe action is taken to hold Israel accountable,” Al-Husseini wrote in an email to The Hoya.
This year’s SJP’s Israeli Apartheid Week did not occur without incident. A Palestinian flag, hung in Red Square on April 1, was taken down April 3 and April 6 by unknown individuals. This resulted in SJP filing two bias incident reports with the university administration.
Georgetown Israel Alliance (GIA) also reported five separate incidents concerning its Israeli flag, which also hung in Red Square. Its flag was removed April 3, 4 and 6, and GIA filed bias reports with the administration. Georgetown University Police Department apprehended the April 6 perpetrator.
SJP Treasurer Olivia Vita (COL ’19) said recent conflicts on the border between Gaza Strip and Israel have added significance to on-campus events.
“This year we didn’t have a particular theme, but the current happenings in Gaza have added another layer of heartfelt sensitivity,” Vita wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians protested along the Gaza Strip on March 30 against Israel’s Gaza Blockade — a land, air, and sea blockade on the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt from 2007 to present — according to The New York Times.
The protests, which involved around 30,000 people, aimed to stage a peaceful sit-in for six weeks before protesters were met with Israeli military force. Gazan health ministry officials said 29 Palestinians have been killed in an escalation of violence between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protestors, with thousands more wounded, including 293 by live fire. The UN Human Rights office said it has indications that Israeli forces used “excessive force” during last week’s crackdown, according to The Independent.
GIA, a club dedicated to Israel’s right to exist as a state, disputes SJP’s definition of the nature of Israel Apartheid Week. Despite individual friendships between some members of GIA and SJP, tensions rise between the two groups every year during Israel Apartheid Week, according to GIA Cultural Chair Andrew Boas (SFS ’20).
“Around Israel Apartheid Week, it obviously gets very tense,” Boas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think for better or for worse, SJP has not been particularly active this year. They come out sort of during Israel Apartheid Week. But as far as it relates to Israel or Palestine, there’s very little cooperation between the groups.”
A main source of tension between the groups has arisen over the meaning of “apartheid” in the week’s title.
Al-Husseini said the use of “apartheid” in the campaign is meant to represent SJP’s view of the relationship between the Israeli government and Palestinians.
“We use the word apartheid in this week’s title because we truly do believe that the current policies carried out by Israeli government represent a system that treat Palestinians like second-class citizens in all aspects of life,” Al-Husseini wrote.
GIA President Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20), who is also a current member of The Hoya’s editorial board, pushed back on the label apartheid as a false characterization of Israel’s political climate.
“If ‘apartheid’ is meant literally, apartheid has a legal definition whose criteria are not met by the situation in Israel. If it is meant metaphorically, then Israel is nothing like apartheid South Africa,” Larkin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Arab Israelis, unlike non-white South Africans, enjoy the same privileges and rights as Jewish Israelis and are integral members of Israel’s political, economic, and cultural life. They live and work alongside non-Arab Israelis, sit in the Israeli parliament, and serve bravely in the Israel Defense Forces at ever-higher rates.”
GIA plans to host Georgetown’s first-ever Israel Peace Week from April 13 to 19, though its week’s purpose is not to rebut Israel Apartheid Week, Larkin said.
“I hope that Israel Peace Week will be a chance for Georgetown students to do their part to move us closer to the vision that many of individuals in both GIA and SJP share, of two states, one Jewish and one Arab, living side-by-side in peace, cooperation, and mutual respect,” Larkin wrote.
Next week, SJP plans to set up a mock apartheid wall in the Intercultural Center Galleria to showcase ongoing instances of “human rights violations conducted by Israel,” Al-Husseini said. Two years ago, the wall was vandalized with anti-Palestinian messages.
A final Israel Apartheid Week event, a charity dinner to benefit a humanitarian aid organization Helping Hand, has not yet been scheduled. SJP may postpone the dinner until next semester because of logistical and scheduling issues, according to Al-Husseini.

It would be difficult to find anything remotely accurate in this unintentionally-hilarious, Orwellian-rewriting of history masquerading as an anti-Israel editorial, but I will restrict myself to the following points:
The myth of Arab Muslim victimhood is cheap propaganda stemming from the failed Arab attempts to destroy Israel and throw its Jewish population “into the sea.”
The anti-Israel left continues to pander to the irrational, bigoted demands of the Middle East’s Arab Muslim majority to suppress the region’s only non-muslim state in favor of yet another Arab Muslim country. That blatant disregard for the rights of anyone who is not an Arab Muslim is precisely the reason why the Jews of Israel had to fight for national independence.
The mere existence of Israel proclaims the national rights of the Jewish INDIGENOUS population of Israel; a country and a people that predate Arab colonialism and will outlive it as well.

An Israeli flag and a Palestinian flag, both hung in Red Square as part of pro-Palestine group Students for Justice in Palestine’s Israel Apartheid Week, were removed multiple times between April 3 and April 8, culminating in the Georgetown University Police Department apprehending one of the perpetrators who stole the Israeli flag.
GUPD concluded their investigation of the incidents, according to Matt Hill, the university’s media relations manager.
“GUPD has concluded investigations of all incidents reported to GUPD and made appropriate referrals to Student Conduct. The university also received bias-related incident reports which are being reviewed by the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity & Affirmative Action accordingly. We encourage anyone with information about these incidents to contact GUPD at 202-687-4343 or via LiveSafe. GUPD will increase foot patrol and surveillance in areas with planned activity,”” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Israel Apartheid Week is an annual protest on college campuses that aims to raise awareness of the continued Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
A Palestinian flag, hung in Red Square on April 1, was taken down once on April 3 and again on April 6 by unknown individuals, resulting in SJP filing two bias-related incident reports with the university. Members of both SJP and the Georgetown Israel Alliance have called on the university to take a stronger stance on incidents that infringe on the rights of student groups to demonstrate in Red Square.
GIA has filed five incident reports with GUPD regarding the theft of the Israeli flag. GIA President Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20), who is also a member of The Hoya’s editorial board, said the Israeli flag was taken down on five separate occasions on April 3, April 4, April 6 and twice on April 8.
GIA Cultural Chair Andrew Boas (SFS ’20), who witnessed the most recent theft of the Israeli flag, said GUPD may classify the thefts as bias-related incidents through the Division of Student Affairs as GUPD pushes for punishment for the suspect.
GUPD has not identified a suspect for the theft of the Palestinian flag, according to SJP Treasurer Olivia Vita (COL ’19).
GUPD did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment on Boas’ and Vita’s statements as of 1:30 a.m.
SJP President Ahmad Al-Husseini (NHS ’20) and Vita both said the Georgetown Program Board removed both flags to post their flyers for its April 6 spring concert, featuring rapper Waka Flocka Flame.
After the Palestinian flag was hung once more in another location in Red Square, it was torn down along with Israel Apartheid Week fact sheets, according to Al-Husseini.
Al-Husseini said SJP chose to hang the Palestinian flag in a display of solidarity with those injured and killed in recent protests on Gaza’s border with Israel and as part of SJP’s Israel Apartheid Week, which is organized to draw attention to the 70 years of Palestinian popular resistance against the continued conflict in the Israel-Palestine region since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.
“We hung the Palestinian flag on Sunday out of solidarity and support for that weekend’s events in Gaza,” Al-Husseini wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians protested along the Gaza Strip on March 30 against Israel’s and Egypt’s continued blockade of Gaza since 2007, according to the New York Times.
The protests, which involved around 30,000 people, aimed to stage a peaceful sit-in for six weeks before protesters were met with Israeli military force. Health ministry officials from Gaza said 34 Palestinians had been killed in an escalation of violence between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protestors, with thousands more wounded, including 293 by live fire, according to Al-Jazeera.
The United Nations Human Rights Council said it has evidence that Israeli forces used “excessive force” during last week’s crackdown, according to The Independent.
Anti-Palestinian sentiments were posted on the wall near the Palestinian flag and on social media shortly after the Palestinian flag went up, Al-Husseini said.
“Less than two hours later, the GIA put up an Israel flag right next to it with individuals responsible for this writing captions such as ‘clap back season’ and other disrespectful captions on social media,” Al-Husseini wrote.
The Georgetown Israel Alliance hung the Israeli flag beside the Palestinian flag to protest the Israel Apartheid Week, according to Boas.
“GIA put up the Israeli flag in response to Israel Apartheid Week, a week-long series of events planned by SJP with the purpose of denying Israel’s right to exist,” Boas wrote. “We feel that the Israeli flag, along with our banner advocating for two-sided dialogue, was a good way to remind Georgetown that we too are on campus and are always willing to dialogue.”
GIA is a pro-Israel group that supports bilateral dialogue and believes in Israel’s right to exist. Boas said that Israel Apartheid Week is a clear denial of Israel’s right to exist.
“The issue with Israel Apartheid Week is that it’s an absolute one-sided denial of Israel’s right to exist,” Boas wrote. “Students For Justice in Palestine goes to great lengths to explain that it is actually about Palestine and not Israel. It’s not an attack on Israel; it’s a protection of Palestine, when in reality we can tell, even by the name of the event Israel Apartheid Week, that it’s an attack on Israel that has no basis on history or reality.”
Vita said there are instances of personal harassment and other anti-Palestinian acts such as theft of Palestinian flags every year.
Boas said GIA has also faced harassment in the past. Boas referenced an incident in March last year when signs with American support for the existence of Israel were defaced.
“They were just pro-Israel messages of peace and coexistence. They were flyers that had been distributed and torn down and also things were written on them that were offensive,” Boas said.
Al-Husseini called on the university to take a stronger stance against the thefts of the Israeli and Palestinian flags, asking them to release a statement condemning the actions.
“These events have become far too common place and do not attract enough attention, as it goes directly against Georgetown’s free speech rights,” Al-Husseini wrote. “Red Square is such a cherished space because it is central to our campus’s idea of promoting free speech and I hate to see these type of vandalism on all sides, so I hope to see the campus issue a formal response to these far too common-place incidents.”
Boas also called for a statement from the university in response to the thefts.
“The university absolutely should issue a statement saying that discrimination or crimes on the basis of national identity, in this case Israeli identity, are obviously condemned by the university and unacceptable in much the same way that they did a statement when swastikas were drawn in LXR,” Boas said.
Hill said Georgetown remains committed to tolerance and the administration supports free speech on campus.
“As a Catholic and Jesuit university, Georgetown is an inclusive community that supports the free and open exchange of ideas and welcomes people of all faiths and racial and ethnic backgrounds. Georgetown does not tolerate actions, including theft or vandalism, that attempt to silence the speech of our community,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.

Two sides, one state and no justice says 
April 13, 2018 at 2:15 am
It seems a bit odd for this news story to allow anyone from SJP to comment on  GIA’s assertion that Georgetown SJP doesn’t accept Israel’s right to exist. GIA would have us believe that criticizing Israeli policy is ultimately about denying the right of Israel to exist full stop. If Al-Husseini or Vita actually believe that, let’s hear it. A return to 1967 lines is not denying Israel’s right to exist. Demanding political and economic freedom for Palestinians is not demanding that Israel be pushed into the sea.

The creation of two distinct nation-states is the most effective solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said former Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni at an event hosted April 13 by the Georgetown Israel Alliance.
Livni, who served as Minister of Justice of Israel from 2013 to 2014 and was the chief negotiator for Israel in 2014 peace talks with Palestinians, hopes to re-initiate negotiations with Palestinians and cooperate to create a two-state solution.
Ambassador and Georgetown professor Dennis Ross moderated the event. The event was co-sponsored by the School of Foreign Service, the Georgetown Israel Alliance, the International Relations Club, the College Democrats and the Institute for Politics and Public Service.
Livni is also the current leader and founder of Israel’s Hatnuah Party, a liberal party formed to offer a non-socialist alternative party to voters frustrated by the stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, according to the Hatnuah website.
The creation of two distinct states is not just to end conflict between Israel and Palestine, but also to enable Israeli and Palestinian citizens to each have their own spaces, Livni said.
“The whole idea is not just to create another state in the Middle East,” Livni said. “The whole idea is to end the conflict on the basis of two states for two peoples, so that each state [provides a space] for different peoples.”
Livni also pushed back on criticisms she has received from Israeli citizens about the potential for compromise, which some view as a sign that they are losing land to the Palestinians.
“The idea of giving the territory to Palestinians is perceived as being too weak, giving the Palestinians,” Livni said. “When I preach for two states for two peoples, I am thinking about Israel as a Jewish democratic state, but I’m being blamed that I’m thinking about the Palestinians. My answer is that I want to find a way to divorce the Palestinians, not to get married to them.”
Livni discussed past proposals for a two-state solution that attempted to end conflict, including the Clinton Parameters, a proposal authored by Ross in 2000 that offered Palestinian leadership a five-pronged solution to try to quell the conflict. The proposal included the creation of an autonomous Palestinian state, wherein Israel would maintain control over everything outside of Gaza and the West Bank and Palestine would agree to accept any refugees who wished to settle in the territory.
Ultimately, the Clinton Parameters agreement stalled and was never implemented.
Livni views the two-state solution as the best way to end the conflict and address ongoing refugee crises within the region.
“The Palestinian state should be the full, complete answer to the desperation of the Palestinians, whoever they may be, those who live in the territories and those who live in refugee camps,” Livni said.
Cooperation will be key in achieving Livni’s hope for a Jewish democratic state, she said.
“On the way, I need to stop at certain stations and reach an agreement with Palestinians, because in order to have Israel as the Jewish democratic state and be the Jewish majority, I cannot give the entire land,” Livni said. “I need to separate from the Palestinians to reach an agreement.”
Ultimately, Livni concluded that she will be content if negotiations between Israel and Palestine can be achieved or if there is greater security in Israel.
“Hopefully, in the end, one of two things will happen,” Livni said. “We will find a party to reach an agreement with, or we will keep Israel’s security, and we will call the settlers living outside the fence to come to Israel and to focus on the vision of Zionism the way I understand it.”

The two-state solution is a textbook example of cognitive dissonance on a grand political scale. 
With regards to the plausibility of the two-state solution, like the Holy Roman Empire, the two-state solution did not solve anything and it wasn’t in the business of creating two states.  Not unless you count a Hamas state in Gaza and a Fatah state in the West Bank.   
Rather, the two-state solution was a perverse euphemism for carving an Islamic terror state out of the land of Israel and the living flesh of her people.   It solved nothing except the shortage of graves in Israel and Muslim terrorists in the Middle East.
In hindsight, the consequences of giving terrorists a country to play with were always about as predictable as running a toaster in the shower.

Georgetown Israel Alliance’s inaugural Israel Peace Week began on April 13, consisting of five events aimed at fostering meaningful conversations about a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The weeklong event began with a discussionwith former Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice Tzipi Livinilast Friday.A vigil to commemorate Yom Hazikaron, a day of remembrance for fallen soldiers and victims of terrorism, was held on Wednesday.
GIA also hosted Uri Keidar, executive director of Israel Hofsheet, a grassroots movement that advocates for civil rights, Wednesday. The week culminated with a celebration of Israel’s 70th anniversary of independence, “Israel Day,” on Thursday, April 19.
The week was dedicated to understanding steps that Israel has taken to achieve peace with Palestine and to explore plans for reconciliation, according to GIA President Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20), who hopes to encourage meaningful conversations about potential solutions for peace (Full disclosure: Larkin is also a member of The Hoya’s Editorial Board).
“We launched Israel Peace Week because we want to change the conversation about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and get people talking about peaceful, win-win solutions to the conflict,” Larkin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Too often, the conflict is approached in terms of a zero-sum game, and we’ve seen campaigns that are more about tearing down one side than building anything constructive.”
GIA cultural chair Andrew Boas (SFS ’20) said the student group has tried to provide an immersive opportunity for Georgetown students who have ties with Israeli culture throughout the week.
GIA invited Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine to participate in the events of Israel Peace Week, according to Boas and Larkin.
SJP President Ahmad Al-Husseini (NHS ’20) said that SJP plans to protest the celebration of Israel Day, which is known to Palestinians as the Nakba, or “catastrophe,” in Arabic.
“SJP’s only involvement in this week’s events will be protesting their disgusting celebration of the 70th year anniversary of the Nakba, which forced out 700,000 Palestinian natives from their homeland as the human price for creating the state of Israel,” Al-Husseini wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Larkin said that Israel Peace Week neither presents a one-sided version of the conflict nor ignores the suffering of Palestinians, despite criticism of the event.
“I understand why someone might think that, but if they were to come to an IPW event, they would see that was not remotely the case,” Larkin wrote.
SJP treasurer Olivia Vita (COL ’19) expressed doubt about the effectiveness of pursuing dialogue about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, noting that tangible changes are likely the only way to forge peace .
“We don’t need words, we need systemic change,” Vita wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Israel Peace Week does not effectively address the problems faced by people of color in Israel, according to Vita, as she believes they are not culturally relevant.
“As a black Jewish young woman with family in Israel, when I think of peace and Israel I think of the ongoing African refugee crisis, recent state violence in Gaza and day-to-day lack of accessibility of resources to people of color in Israel, Jewish and non-Jewish,” Vita wrote. “The events are neither relevant to current events nor reflective of the ever-diversifying population of Israel and Palestine.”
Israel Peace Week aims to present the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a multifaceted topic with speakers who advocated for a solution that would benefit both Palestinians and Israelis, according to Larkin.
“One consistent motif throughout IPW has been to showcase the complex, multi-dimensional character of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Larkin wrote. “That’s why we hosted Tzipi Livni and co-hosted Nadav Tamir with J Street U Georgetown, both of them repeatedly stressed the need for reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis and the need for a Palestinian state in order to fulfill Palestinian national aspirations in their own space.”
Larkin said that Israel Peace Week is a positive way for Jewish students to finish the school year, especially after the start of the school year, when swastikas were found painted inside an LXR hallway during Rosh Hashana, he said.
“In a school year that started off with swastikas, Israel Day will end things on a high note,” Larkin said.

Being progressive and being pro-Israel are not mutually exclusive, but compatible, Congressman Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) said at an event Tuesday.
Deutch, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, discussed the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship and potential solutions for the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Deutch has frequently travelled to Israel and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
The event, cohosted by the Georgetown Israel Alliance, Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and Georgetown University College Democrats, included a conversation with Deutch moderated by President of GIA Ben Goodman (SFS ’20), who is also a Hoya Staff Writer.
Deutch describes himself as a “passionate supporter of Israel,” according to his official website. In September, Deutch and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) introduced legislation that authorizes new collaboration between the U.S. and Israel on issues related to humanitarian projects, drones and outer space.
Israel is losing the support of Democratic American voters, according to a New York Times Magazine article published March 2015. Netanyahu has turned to Deutch to find support, according to the article.
His Democratic values and progressive outlook do not conflict with his support for Israel, Deutch said.
“I am a progressive and argue that my support for Israel is not something that I need to fit with my progressive views; rather it is entirely consistent with those views,” Deutch said.
Deutch’s belief in a two-state solution, which would mean the creation of two distinct nation-states between Israel and Palestine, reinforces his progressive politics, he said.
“In order for there to be peace, we try to ensure that the facts on the ground don’t preclude the possibility of getting to a two state solution,” Deutch said.
In a news release on his official website published Sept. 12, Deutch said that the United States must support Israel in its national security endeavors.
“Israel is under constant threat from every direction. A threat to Israel, our strategic ally in a turbulent region, is also a threat to our national security,” Deutch said in a press release about the bill. “Enhancing Israel’s security is a step toward strengthening our own national security,” he said.
Members of Congress sometimes use the U.S. policy toward Israel as a political bargaining chip because the topic has turned partisan, Deutch said.
“In my own party there are some democrats who have challenges with Trump, and so it gets to be challenging if people start to equate support for Israel as something President Trump has,” Deutch said. “It’s important to always remember the relationship has always been bipartisan and that’s why it has been so successful.”
Deutch said that both sides of the political spectrum support the U.S.-Israel relationship and engage with Israel.
“Giving my colleagues the chance to hear from different political officials in Israel helps people understand when we talk about shared values, its more than just belief in equality and human rights, but it actually focuses on the free exchange of ideas,” Deutch said.
According to Deutch, debates about U.S. policy toward Israel lead to broadened bipartisan discussions.
“It’s a chance to start with the discussion of the U.S.-Israel relationship and sometimes broaden to other discussions,” Deutch said.
Deutch first got involved with the Israeli community as an undergraduate and law student at the University of Michigan and has developed a fuller appreciation for the issues that Israel encounters since becoming a Congressman, he said.
“There’s still that same passion about the country and the change I’ve seen over the past number of decades, but a more sophisticated understanding of the challenges now,” Deutch said on Tuesday.
The event was successful because it brought in an audience with varying levels of knowledge and opinions, Goodman said in an interview with The Hoya.
“As the Georgetown Israel Alliance, we run the gambit from knowing and caring a lot about Israel to not knowing much at all,” Goodman said. “The event was a big success for us as an organization in that such a variety of people were able to come and make their voices heard and hear from Congressman Deutch.”

President Donald Trump’s election in 2016 inspired a growth of anti-Semitism, said American Defamation League National Director Emeritus and Holocaust survivor Abraham Foxman at an event Oct. 10 in the Mortara Center for International Studies.
Foxman heads the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York City. He was joined by Rabbi David Saperstein, who served as the director and chief legal counsel at the Union for Reform Judaism’s Religious Action Center for nearly four decades. Saperstein also worked at the Department of State as the U.S. ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom until January 2017.
The event, hosted by the Center for Jewish Civilization, sought to explore the status of anti-Semitism today.
The number of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States rose by 57 percent in 2017, the largest single-year increase on record since 1979, according to the ADL. Incidents of anti-Semitism on college campuses and in schools nearly doubled in 2017, for the second year in a row.
Foxman blamed Trump’s influence in part for the rise of anti-Semitic behavior in the United States in the past few years; he cited the “Unite the Right” rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Va., as evidence of a rise in anti-Semitism in recent years.
“Trump is not an anti-Semite. He did not create Charlottesville, nor did he create the 200 anti-Semites in the angry, disgusting march,” Foxman said. “But he has legitimized uncivil behavior and disrespect. He does this every day. He empowers and gives chutzpah to the Charlottesville 200, who believe that it’s OK to act out their hate.”
Norms against anti-Semitism in the United States have protected Jews since the end of World War II, according to Foxman, but recently, anti-Semitic rhetoric has been on the rise, he said.
“[Anti-Semitism] has been in the sewers, with the covers on. Now, there is nothing you cannot say. There is no one you cannot criticize or attack or denigrate, etc.,” Foxman said. “This has now become part of our environment — an environment where lies are tolerated.”
The Internet has provided a new platform for anti-Semitic thought by allowing individuals to conceal themselves, according to Foxman.
“The Internet puts the mask back on the bigot. It provides the bigot the anonymity of expressing, promoting and advocating their bigotry under the guise of a mask,” Foxman said. “And here are serious issues. How do you balance freedom of speech and security? It’s a constant balance. But the Internet gives them a lot of cover.”
The anti-Semitic trends in the United States reflect a global rise of anti-Semitism and xenophobia.
“We’ve seen the removal of established taboos in the political and civil establishment and legitimizing the singling out and denigrating [of] ethnic, religious, color, gender minorities,” Foxman said.
Media outlets have historically offered a method to combat anti-Semitism, according to Foxman.
“The media has been a very important vehicle and instrument in fighting lies. Anti-Semitic beliefs are lies. They are conspiracy theories,” Foxman said. “To a large extent, in civil society, in democratic society, in the last 50 to 70 years, one of the areas where we could expose, where we can challenge, where we can educate, was the media.”
Yet Trump’s consistent critique of the media — such as calling media outlets “fake news” — weakened the media’s ability to combat anti-Semitic ideas, Foxman said.
“The media is under attack. It’s under attack here and around the world,” Foxman said. “Here it’s fake news, here it’s the enemy of the people, etc., and [this] has a very specific impact on Jews and anti-Semitism.”
The recent rise in anti-Semitism threatens Jews around the world, even in places traditionally welcoming to Jews, like the United States, according to Foxman.
“I worry about democracy. Democracy is fragile,” Foxman said. “I worry today more for the safety of my children and grandchildren as Jews even in this country.”

Opposition to Park51
Several critics have spoken against Foxman’s opposition to the Park51 From wikipedia:  “Islamic community center near the World Trade Center site, citing hypocrisy, since ADL’s mission statement says it seeks “to put an end forever to unjust and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens”. Fareed Zakaria, a recipient of ADL’s Hubert H. Humphrey First Amendment Freedoms Prize, has returned the prize and its $10,000 honorarium, saying that he “cannot in good conscience hold onto the award or the honorarium that came with it”. Zakaria has “urged the ADL to reverse its decision”.

Israel’s technology industry struggles to cultivate diversity, said Ifat Baron, founder and executive of ItWorks, an Israeli non-profit that promotes diversity in the technology industry, at the Start-Up Nation Tech Fair on Oct. 16.
The tech fair, which was hosted by the Georgetown Israel Alliance, brought to campus Israeli companies including Annoto, an educational video annotating company; Easyway, an artificial intelligence traveling companion; Innovation: Africa, a non-profit which provides water and electricity to countries in Africa; Materials Zone, a database for scientific research; and VR Wiz, a virtual reality production studio.
Israeli Arabs are underrepresented in Israel’s technology industry, reflecting a widespread inequality between Jewish Israelis and Arab Israelis, according to Baron. About 50 percent of Israel’s exports are from the high-tech industry.
“Less than 2 percent of engineers in the high-tech industry are Arabs and 66 percent of Arab children will live in poverty, [compared to] 20 percent of Jewish children,” Baron said.
Transportation to and from the center of Israel, the epicenter of the country’s technology industry, presents an obstacle to increasing the numbers of Israeli Arabs working for Israeli tech companies, according to Baron.
“Most of the companies are located in the center [of Israel], and most Arab villages will be in the north,” Baron said.
The Israeli technology sector has faced diversity shortcomings in other areas, specifically for women and Orthodox Jews, according to Baron. Israeli women face sexism in science, technology, engineering and mathematic fields, while Orthodox Jews struggle to integrate into the technology industry because they require religious accommodations, Baron said.
“If you are [a] man, living in the center, Jewish and white, your chances of finding a job — very, very high,” Baron said. “If you are a woman, if you are Arab, if you are ultra-Orthodox, your chances are slim to none.”
ItWorks strives to assist minorities in Israel with professional development and help technology companies develop strategies for increasing diversity, according to Baron.
“We are offering all the tools they need, networking, soft skills seminar, English seminar, interview skills seminar and vocational training,” Baron said. “We also help the companies understand that there are different codes of conduct for women, Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews.”
The Start-Up Nation Tech Fair offered students an opportunity to meet representatives of Israeli technology companies, GIA president Ben Goodman (COL ’20) said. (Full disclosure: Goodman is a deputy sports editor for The Hoya.)
“Attendees certainly got to network and advance their own prospects at the tech fair, but hopefully they also took away the amazing things these startups do — or have the potential to do — for the world around them,” Goodman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “These are not just companies looking to make a buck; they are missions to care for the world being put into action.”
Nearly 300 students registered for the Start-Up National Tech Fair, according to Maya Rabinowitz (COL ’21), the Speaker and Events Chair of GIA. GIA intended to use the tech fair to showcase the business and technology industry in Israel, according to Rabinowitz.
“The reason we wanted to put on the event was to show a side of Israel outside of politics,” Rabinowitz said. “Many who are unfamiliar with the startup hub in Israel associate the country with conflict in the Middle East. I hope that everyone who attended learned about all of the innovation and technology coming out of Israel and might even want to work in Israel one day.”
David Suter, chief marketing officer of Materials Zone, an online research database that provides its subscribers with access to research data and one of the companies at the fair, said Tel Aviv offers his company a robust community of businesses that has helped it expand its platform in the city.
“Tel Aviv is a great place to test things out,” Suter said, “because even though it’s small, everyone is there — Google, Facebook, everyone is nearby.”

Fr. Matthew Carnes, S.J., sat back in his brown leather chair with an earnest look on his face. As a government professor, Carnes regularly lectures on topics that could be deemed divisive, such as U.S. foreign policy and social welfare programs. The Jesuit professor opens the semester in his “Comparative Political Systems” class by warning students they will discuss politically charged topics — and by asking them to presume good intent in others, even during disagreement.
The classroom is a space for students to express a wide variety of political opinions, not to preach his own political leanings, according to Carnes.
“I hope at the end of the semester my students have no idea what my political leanings are,” Carnes said. “I want my students to think to themselves, ‘Oh, he said things about, for example, social justice that I might associate with the left, but he also made an argument for a side that I would cite as more conservative.’”
Yet not all professors park their political opinions at the door before entering the classroom.
Surrounded by a myriad of Semitic language books in his office, Ori Soltes, a theology professor in the Center for Jewish Civilization, told The Hoya that he frequently incorporates politically sensitive topics in his courses to stimulate effective dialogue among students.
In this week’s lecture for his “Unraveling the Middle East,” course, Soltes invited his students to disagree with him, push back and ask questions. Standing behind a wooden podium and gesturing at a chalkboard covered in names and dates, Soltes spent an hour and fifteen minutes demystifying complex terms to make the unclear clear.
“Sometimes I ask questions to prod at things, other times I wait for my students to ask me questions to foster dialogue,” Soltes said.
The choice to disclose political opinions in the classroom, in office hours or on personal social media accounts falls on Georgetown’s professors. While all faculty members agree on the importance of maintaining open dialogue in the classroom, they depart on how best to accomplish this goal. Without uniform university guidelines about where professors should draw the line on revealing their personal biases, some professors color their lectures with political commentary. Others prefer to remain neutral, leaving students unsure of where their teachers lie on the political spectrum.
Teaching Under Trump
Like most students, faculty members occupy both sides of the political spectrum. The extent to which professors choose to share their political beliefs in the classroom is up to their discretion. The university does not impose a formal policy or restriction on speech inside the classroom for professors, according to Carnes. The only guidelines that help professors navigate their rhetoric in classrooms is Georgetown’s free speech policy, which mandates that the University, “has a solemn responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of deliberation and debate, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.”
With Jewish Civilization classes like “Moses to Muhammed,” Soltes deals with contentious subject areas like the theological implications of the Holocaust and the Arab-Israeli conflict. Yet Soltes believes his political opinions prompt lively debate among his students. In class, he does not limit himself, speaking freely and revealing his viewpoints about U.S. politics.
“I’m not going to not say something anti-Trump because I’m worried about how it might affect the opinion of one student,” Soltes said.
However, students who support President Donald Trump should not remain silent in his lectures. In the past, students with opposing political perspectives to Soltes have spoken up in class. These students are not penalized and are encouraged to contribute to class discourse, according to Soltes.
Due to similarities between Nazi Germany and the Trump administration, Trump’s actions can sometimes help understand the content in his Holocaust course, Soltes said.
“If it’s relevant to my course then I’m going to bring it up,” Soltes said. “There are too many parallels for me to not talk about it.”
Yet not all Georgetown professors are comfortable critiquing Trump in front of their students.
School of Foreign Service Professor Christine Fair, who teaches primarily Asian studies and security, said she avoids bringing politics — particularly U.S. politics — into her classroom.
“I am much more concerned about the sensitivities of those students who may be from the areas in South Asia that we are studying,” Fair said. “I don’t discuss Trump or the presidency in my classes because there is no need to, there is no place for that.”
Fair recently faced scrutiny from Georgetown students and alumni after she spoke out against Republican senators’ support for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh with a Sept. 22 tweet.
Government Professor Mark Rom also said personal opinions about the current U.S. administration should be kept aside.
“I have my personal opinions about President Trump’s immigration, tax, environmental and trade policies, and our students probably do too,” Rom wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I do not believe my opinions about these policies are relevant to the class.”
Fair Play: Political Plurality
The flexibility that professors enjoy can leave some feeling unsure about how to navigate sensitive political topics, worried they may offend certain students, Fair said.
Fair’s recent tweet sparked controversy due to its graphic imagery.
“Look at [this] chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapist’s arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps,” Fair wrote on her personal Twitter account. “Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.”
After the message — which Fair explained was intended to make readers uncomfortable, but not to provoke violence — Fair and university administrators decided she would take immediate research leave out of “an abundance of caution for the security of our community,” Dean Joel Hellman wrote in an Oct. 5 email to members of the School of Foreign Service community.
The existence of a “contra-power” caused her to take a forced sabbatical, Fair said.
“The university is under the impression that the professor has all the power, but that isn’t necessarily the case,” Fair said. People outside of the Georgetown community exert pressure on the school to take action against a member of the community, according to Fair.
While university President John J. DeGioia issued a statement Oct. 2 that condemned the “use of violent imagery,” he also reiterated the university’s commitment to protecting community members’ freedom of speech.
In the hopes of fostering dialogue, Fair aims to create a safe environment in her classroom by discouraging her students from using social media during lectures. With an active social media presence, Fair also dissuades her students from following her various personal accounts: She believes her political views are not relevant to her classes and prevent the classroom from serving as a space for open dialogue.
The Importance of Neutrality
A frequent professor of the government department’s “United States Political Systems” course, Rom deals with U.S. politics in his classroom on a daily basis.
Rom said he attempts to remain neutral, curtailing his opinions and analyzing politics from every angle.
“Some professors believe it is their responsibility to reveal their political, partisan and ideological preferences and commitments as a matter of honesty and openness,” Rom wrote. “I am not one of those professors.”
Maintaining political objectivity in the classroom is important so that students can develop their own political leanings and not feel pressured to appeal to their professor’s perspective, according to Rom.
“First, I don’t believe it is my job to train students to be Republicans or Democrats, liberals or conservatives. Those decisions are deeply personal matters, and I respect my students’ thoughtful consideration of them,” Rom wrote. “Second, students should know that their grades do not depend on their political views, and that they need neither curry favor by agreeing with mine nor fear retribution if they disagree.”
Certain situations require professors to adapt their limits. Carnes dedicated a significant portion of his lecture after Trump was elected in November 2016 to students airing their grievances, concerns and support for the election result in hopes of fostering productive dialogue.
Impartiality is Carnes’ end goal, but he admits it can be difficult in a class that discusses nationhood, identity and other political ideas.
“I just want to emphasize that I’m not perfect, but I try my best,” Carnes said.

Georgetown’s Jewish community and its allies are calling for action against antisemitism in the wake of Saturday’s mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.
Robert Bowers entered the Tree of Life synagogue with an assault rifle and three handguns, killing 11 and injuring nine on the morning of Oct. 27. Bowers has since pleaded not guilty to the 44 counts a grand jury indicted him of on Wednesday.
The shooting marks the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the United States, according to The Washington Post.
Georgetown University Jewish Life, along with Jewish student groups Alpha Epsilon Pi, Jewish Student Association and J Street U, hosted a vigil Saturday night in Makóm, Georgetown University’s Jewish community’s gathering space, in order to mourn those killed in Pittsburgh.
The Georgetown University Office of Campus Ministry held an interfaith service of mourning and solidarity in Dahlgren Quad on Monday afternoon. Community members grieved those who died on Saturday but also encouraged renewed activism against antisemitism.
Paige Harouse (COL ’19), who works for the Office of Campus Ministry, said that while solidarity is important, it is not enough.
“Every day of the year, we, as Jews or as allies, must act,” Harouse said. “Call out the antisemitism of your family, your friends, your ‘groups.’ Don’t talk about the ‘globalists’ or the ‘Zionists’ or the ‘urbanites.’”
Avis Lis (COL ’19), the president of Georgetown’s Jewish Student Association, said he similarly appreciates the support from the Georgetown community, but hopes Hoyas take further action to combat antisemitism.
“We name this shooting for what it was: not an isolated act by an insane individual, but rather an anti-Semitic hate crime,” Lis wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We call on all students to take action. Learn about antisemitism. Speak out against those who vilify capitalists, communists, globalists, or Zionists, when they really mean Jews. Raise your voice to eradicate anti-Semitic language in your community. For if not now, when?”
Both Jewish Life at Georgetown and the Georgetown Israel Alliance wrote that despite the immense loss the global Jewish community has suffered, it will find strength in its unity in the face of hate crimes and efforts to tear it apart.
“The Jewish community at Georgetown and Jewish communities across the globe are all overcome, and yet we will continue to stand firm and to stand proudly together,” Jewish Life at Georgetown University wrote in a statement published on their website.
GIA President Ben Goodman (SFS ’20) expressed solidarity with those affected by the shooting and said that action must be taken to combat antisemitism. (Full Disclosure: Goodman is a deputy editor for the Sports section of The Hoya.)
“We are devastated by last weekend’s senseless massacre, but we resolve to move forward and continue to confront antisemitism and stand by the Jewish people worldwide,” Goodman wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We were comforted to see an outpouring of support in Israel, where vigils were held in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Whatever country we reside in, the jewish people are one, which we are reminded of now more than ever.”
The directors of Orthodox Christian Life,  Protestant Ministry and Catholic Life at Georgetown V. Rev. David Pratt, Rev. Bryant Oskvig and Dr. Jim Wickman jointly wrote an open letter to the Georgetown community condemning antisemitism and growing social fragmentation. The directors warned against letting such divisions erode senses of community at Georgetown and around the world.
“We must affirm the truth that persons of different religions and different races can live together in authentic community with the blessings of peace and mutual affirmation,” the directors wrote.  “We need to embrace this benevolent version of community, a version in which we recognize and care for the needs and wounds of one another, no matter our differences. By this, we can offer light against the current shadow being cast upon our world.”
Professors also have a responsibility to stand up to antisemitism and to radical biases in their classrooms, Director of the Center for Jewish Civilization Jacques Berlinerblau said.
“Now is not the time for platitudes or euphemism,” Berlinerblau said in an interview with The Hoya. “I really think professors need to put themselves out there.”
The United States has failed to properly to acknowledge the extent to which antisemitism is present and alive today and needs now more than recognize the threat it poses, according to Berlinerblau.
“Enough with prayers. We need analysis,” Berlinerblau said. “The issue of antisemitism and bigotry in the United States is bigger than we care to imagine. It’s not a small phenomenon.”
In the face of such a tragedy, however, the Jewish community at Georgetown has expressed its resolve and belief in the possibility of change. Though bigotry persists, so, too, will the jewish faith and its followers, Harouse said.
“This past Shabbat was a grim reminder that the tensions aren’t going anywhere,” Harouse said. “That we’re gathered here today, tears still fresh, is a testament to our strength and perseverance. The tensions may still be here, but we are too, with a hope that’s been burning for some 2000 years. Am Yisrael Chai.”

Washington, D.C.’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency announced on Oct. 29 nearly $1 million in grants to improve security at D.C. religious institutions.
The grants come as security concerns for local synagogues increase in the wake of the Oct. 27 mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.
HSEMA selected nine D.C. faith institutions to receive the funding to improve security measures. Six of the nine institutions are Jewish organizations, three of which are synagogues: Adas Israel Congregation, the Georgetown Synagogue-Kesher Israel Congregation and Sixth & I Synagogue, Inc.
Though security grants for nonprofit organizations in the District are not new, and the recipient organizations applied in the summer of 2017, Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) referenced the shooting in Pittsburgh in HSEMA’s announcement.
“On the heels of tragedy, we continue the work of building a more peaceful world — a world in which hatred and evil are erased and our country has common-sense gun control,” Bowser said in the news release. “Through grants like these, we can do more to ensure residents and visitors feel safe throughout the District — especially in our places of worship.”
HSEMA is also offering new emergency preparednessworkshops for local organizations in the face of increased threats to certain faith-based organizations, according to HSEMA Director Chris Rodriguez.
“We will empower and educate nonprofits about the importance of conducting physical threat assessments, encouraging personal preparedness to their communities, and developing robust applications to secure future funding,” Rodriguez said.
Bowser directed the Metropolitan Police Department to provide officers and increase security measures for synagogues following the shooting in Pittsburgh.
“As we learn more about this attack, we reiterate: ignorance and hate have no place in our society. An attack on one community is an attack on all of us and on the ideals we stand for and fight for every day,” Bowser said in an Oct. 27 news release.
Local Jewish organizations have also committed to ensuring synagogues have sufficient funding for appropriate security precautions. The Jewish Federation, a nonprofit organization, committed to donating at least $100,000 to a fund to improve security at local synagogues and Jewish organizations.
“Together, we can continue to ensure that our community is strong, vibrant, resilient, and safe, even and especially in the face of those who seek to tear us apart,” the Jewish Federation wrote on its website.
Local synagogues have said that, though shaken, they feel prepared to deal with the tragedy and ensure the safety of their congregants. Sixth & I Communications Senior Associate Michelle Eider said the synagogue is responding in kind to the recent tragedy.
“For many years, Sixth & I has taken extra security precautions at all of our programs and events,” Eidler wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We will continue to do so and are working with the Metropolitan Police Department and other local law enforcement to ensure that our security measures are appropriate.”
Executive Director of Temple Rodef Shalom Beth Silver said the temple has grown accustomed to a certain level of security threats.
“We’re just continuing what we’re doing and always reviewing our security,” Silver said in an interview with The Hoya.“We have a very close relationship with local law enforcement and they’ve been great to work with all along and especially helpful in the last week.”
Georgetown Jewish Student Association President Aviv Lis (COL ’19) said that, disappointing as it is to see synagogues taking such security precautions, such measures are important to ensure individuals can worship in safety.
“We are deeply saddened that the need for heightened security is a conversation each synagogue must have,” Lis said. “Every community should do what it feels I best to ensure the safety, security and comfort of its congregants.”

As a Jewish student at Georgetown University, Sam Appel (COL ’20) was not interested in taking classes within the minor offered by the the Center for Jewish Civilization when he arrived his freshman year.
“Freshman year, I heard about the CJC, and I thought to myself, ‘No way I would want to be a part of that.’ I’m at university, and one goal of university is to learn about things you don’t know,” Appel said. “I’m Jewish; why do I have to take classes on being Jewish? I could take classes on economics, sociology, history of all kinds, [women’s] and gender studies, and so at first I thought to myself, ‘With all of these classes, why would I join the CJC?’”
Yet Appel slowly changed his mind during his sophomore year, after taking “Blacks and Jews in America,” a course in the CJC co-taught by professors Terrence Johnson and Jacques Berlinerblau.
Appel said he became hooked after studying parallels between the experiences of Jewish and black people, as well as being taught by Berlinerblau, the CJC director.
“I took ‘Blacks and Jews,’ which was a phenomenal class,” Appel said. “From there on, when you learn about a subject, that’s when you become grasped by it.”
The CJC has evolved from an unknown minor with no membership to being on the brink of enrolling its 100th member in under 15 years. The goal of the center is to create a space for both Jewish and non-Jewish students to study Jewish history, religion and culture, in concert with the rest of the world’s politics, according to Berlinerblau. With antisemitic attacks still taking place, such as the shooting in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 27, CJC members choose to minor in Jewish civilization in an attempt to combat misunderstandings surrounding Judaism and the community that represents the faith.
CJC’s History 
Conceived in 2003 as the Program for Jewish Studies, the CJC has always been housed under the School of Foreign Service with its offices located in the Intercultural Center. After the CJC struggled to be fully operational in its early years, Berlinerblau, author of “How to Be Secular: A Call to Arms for Religious Freedom,”  was invited to Georgetown in 2007 as a visiting professor to lead and expand the program with the help of administrator Melissa Weinberg. By the end of 2007, the CJC officially became a minor in the College and a certificate for SFS students, according to Berlinerblau. In 2016, the program relaunched, branding itself the Center for Jewish Civilization, as it is referred to by students today. The center remains a research unit and source of teaching within the SFS.
Since its creation, the CJC has been actively encouraging students to become a part of the program.
“We’re always trying to bring Jews in conversation with others. We have a course called ‘Israel and the Arab Spring,’” Berlinerblau said. “So if you look at our courses — Israeli and Palestinian literature — everything we do kind of looks out instead of in.”
Initially, the CJC spent thousands of dollars every year to cater events and have speakers come to campus. Speakers such as Tzip Livni, former Israeli minister of foreign affairs, and Tamara Wittes, Brookings Institute senior fellow, have sat on panels hosted by the center in the past. Yet the expenses yielded increased student engagement, as these events offered a place for students to convene and piqued their interest in Jewish studies, according to Berlinerblau.
The CJC’s aim is twofold as it caters to both Jewish and non-Jewish communities, Berlinerblau said.
“So, we are two things at once — we are a place for students who are Jewish-affiliated, or are Jewish, or have Jewish boyfriends or girlfriends, or just are interested in Judaism; we are a place for them to come. But we are also a place for people who might not have any of those interests to feel very comfortable as well,” Berlinerblau said.
Confronting Antisemitism
Considering recent national tragedies such as the Pittsburgh shooting, the CJC strives to offer emotional support for its members. In the wake of the attack, the center encouraged students to attend an interfaith service held in Dahlgren Quad to mourn the loss of 11 Jewish lives.
Antisemitic instances have increased on Georgetown’s campus in 2017, according to the university’s Annual Security Report. The CJC aims to be a safe space during these times of trauma, offering the lounge as an area for students.
“The CJC is two spaces at once, and there’s like a balancing act, right? It’s a Jewish space, but it’s also a very multicultural space, and this is because we always understood Judaism not as something that is siloed but is in dialogue with everyone else,” Berlinerblau said. “We never wanted to ghettoize our unit; we didn’t want it to be just about Jews.
The center regularly schedules events that promote better understanding of antisemitism. On Oct. 10, U.S. lawyer and activist Abraham Foxman spoke about whether antisemitism is a clear danger to current U.S. society at a CJC event. Foxman serves as the head of the Center for the Study of Antisemitism at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York. The CJC also took part in the Stoltz Family Biennial Conference on Contemporary European Antisemitism on Nov. 7, in a further effort to provide more programming for the Georgetown community regarding the impact of antisemitism.
Growth: A Personalized Approach  
Having limited membership from its onset, the CJC has developed a strategy to expand its student reach. As CJC director, Berlinerblau’s objective was to regain the trust of the Jewish community both on and off campus at Georgetown, after the program suffered a delayed start. The CJC offered approximately 20 free lectures annually that hosted speakers, offered free food, and provided a space for Jewish and non-Jewish students to congregate.
“Slowly the community began to trust us a little bit more. We rebuilt relations with Jewish communities like [the Anti-Defamation League], which honored [University President John] DeGioia as the man of the year last year,” Berlinerblau said.
CJC Chief of Staff Anna Dubinsky (SFS ’12), who oversees the center’s financial measures in addition to offering student support on academic programming, said she regrets not taking up the CJC as a minor.
“I’m sad I missed it as a student,” Dubinsky said. “I did not get this kind of personal advising; I don’t think I really got this close to any professors in undergrad, and I think that’s a missed opportunity, because not only did I find those people, but no one reached out to me.”
CJC’s personalized approach separates it from other departments, according to Dubinsky.
“All of our professors and staff members just actively reach out and not necessarily from the point of recruiting but just from the point of advising students and providing them with this really intense, really personal mentorship that I think is really rare,” Dubinsky said.
Though the CJC has increased in size, tripling from the 35 students four years ago to being five shy of 100 this semester, the personal attention each student receives remains one of the most important focuses of the administration, according to Dubinsky.
“Every single staff member knows every single student. Over the past four years we’ve tripled, but we still provide that personal care. It’s not just knowing their name; it’s knowing their family. We’ve met some of their parents; we know beyond their academic record and their name who it is that’s walking through the doors, and we want to know them, and we want them to know us,” Dubinsky said.
Multiple elements attracted Appel to the CJC. Appel cited the material, the professors, the administrators and the students housed under the center as reasons to take up the minor.
As the CJC nears accepting its 100th member, the center hopes to expand further by becoming a major in the college. Dubinsky emphasized that the real success of the program is more than just size.
“It’s not just about increasing numbers; that’s a great perk, but it’s really about the fact that what we’re doing is working because people want to be a part of it,” Dubinsky said.

Oppressive policies toward women in the Middle East must be combatted, scholars, leaders and activists said at a panel on women’s rights in Iran on Dec. 5.
Iran currently ranks in the bottom third among 153 countries in a women’s well-being and empowerment index created by the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security, which hosted the event. Iran’s low ranking in the index, which evaluates countries based on peace, security, women’s inclusion and justice, stems from legal discrimination against women in divorce and workplace laws.
The panelists were women’s rights activist Masih Alinejad, actress and human rights activist Nazanin Boniadi, Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute senior fellow Afshin Molavi, author and Georgetown School of Foreign Service centennial fellow Azar Nafisi, and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace senior fellow Karim Sadjadpour.
The event, which was co-moderated by Ambassador Melanne Verveer, the first U.S. ambassador for global women’s issues, and Margaret Brennan, CBS News’ senior foreign affairs correspondent, was hosted in Gaston Hall.
After the formation of the current Islamic Republic of Iran, the government mandated that women cover their hair. The hijab requirement has contributed to a general decline in women’s rights in the country, according to Boniadi. 
“At the inception of the Islamic Republic 39 years ago, tens of thousands of Iranian women demonstrated in opposition to the new government’s compulsory hijab ruling,” Boniadi said. “Their cries were met with batons, lashes, acid thrown in their faces and imprisonment.” 
Nafisi wrote “Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books,” an account of her experiences after returning to Iran during the revolution. Laws that require women in Iran to wear hijabs in public spaces are not merely religious requirements, but a way for the Iranian government to repress and control women, according to Nafisi.
“The hijab in Iran is not about religion. It is about an ideology in order to preserve power. It is uniformity. It is like Mao jackets that people wore in the Republic of China,” Nafisi said. “[The Iranian government] brought this uniformity and they made women into semiotic signs, into political entities, you know. The first thing they did in culture was to delete women.”
Without the mandatory hijab law, some women would choose to expose their heads, according to Nafisi.
“If this was Iranian women’s tradition and we believed in it, why do you have to use guns and jail and punishment and impose a law for them to wear it?” Nafisi said. 
Alinejad, founder of the My Stealthy Freedom campaign against the compulsory hijab, was exiled from Iran after posting an Instagram picture of herself in the country without a hijab. 
Social media gives a voice to women in the Iranian women’s rights movement, according to Alinejad. 
“In Iran, for 40 years, we never had the chance to be seen, to be visible,” Alinejad said. “Through social media we gained our voice back. That is why I always say that every individual woman in Iran can become their own leader and we get successful if every one of us became a headache for the government of Iran.” 
Nafisi has been labelled as Western by Westerners who critique her position as an Iranian woman opposed to compulsory hijab laws and the Iranian government, she said.
“They would look at you and say, ‘But it’s your culture,’ or they would call me ‘Western,’ you know, and ‘an agent of Western imperialism.’” Nafisi said. “As if only Western women want the right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.”
Alinejad called for Western women to support Iranian women’s rights despite the common argument that gender inequality is part of Middle Eastern culture and said supporting women’s rights does not make Westerners Islamophobic.
“By calling this our culture, you are insulting us, and culture is not written to stone, it is flexible. It changes generation to generation. Join us and be loud enough,” Alinejad said. “Supporting the women’s rights movement in the Middle East, in Saudi Arabia, in Iran, doesn’t make you Islamophobic.”
Limiting women’s rights can negatively affect the success of a nation’s economy, according to Molavi.
“Show me a country that provides its women with equal rights, both legislatively and culturally, and I’ll show you a successful economy,” Molavi said. 
In addition to oppressing women, the Iranian government also hinders the success of the Iranian economy through its guiding ideologies, according to Sadjadpour.
“It’s a government who their organizing principle isn’t life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, economic prosperity of the people,” Sadjadpour said. “It is death to America, death to Israel, mandatory hijab — and as long as that is your organizing principle, you are always going to fall way below potential.”
Sadjadpour said he believed that some of these ideologies could change, stating that he was optimistic about the values of the younger generation of Iranian men.
“Men essentially sat on the sidelines as women were being beaten up,” Sadjadpour said. “It’s a real source of shame, but I feel optimistic that the younger generation of Iranian men have a much different vision.”

An open letter requesting Washington, D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans (D-Ward 2) step down as National Committeeman of the D.C. Democratic Party was published March 6, following allegations that he misused his position to solicit corporate deals.
Evans is the councilmember who represents the neighbourhoods including Georgetown, Dupont Circle and Foggy Bottom, among other areas. 
The letter, addressed to Evans, was signed by 23 members of the D.C. Democratic State Committee after accusations that Evans used his position in government leadership to solicit business deals from private firms publicly surfaced Feb. 28.
A grand jury subpoenaed documents relating to legislation benefiting Digi Outdoor Media, a digital commercial advertising firm, last September. Evans said he returned money and stock shares that he received from the digital sign company before introducing the legislation in a text message to The Washington Post.
Evans should step down because his compromised reputation will jeopardize the momentum of legislation addressing important D.C. issues such as statehood, according to Zachary Israel, a D.C. Young Democrats national committeeman. Israel signed the open letter to Evans.
“There are many individuals who are better able to serve and represent us on the Democratic National Committee, and the time has come for him to do the right thing and step down for the good of the party,” Israel wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
D.C. Working Families, a progressive advocacy group that seeks to raise living standards for working families, drafted and released a petition March 6 calling for Evans to be stripped of his chairmanship of the Committee on Finance and Revenue. The petition also requested Evans be removed from his position on the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety. 
The focus on Evans has distracted from D.C. efforts for initiatives such as the push for statehood, and have jeopardized voter trust in the Democratic party, according to the letter.
“The clouds growing over your alleged activities complicate efforts to win D.C. Statehood, determine D.C.’s position in the primary calendar and restore the faith of D.C. voters that their local Democratic Party leadership puts their interests first,” the letter read.
A representative from Evans’ office declined to comment on the accusations.
The allegations and open letter have received mixed responses. President of D.C. Young Democrats Marcus Goodwin said the letter was premature because the allegations against Evans have not yet received a comprehensive investigation, according to The Washington Post. 
D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson (D) announced he would reprimand Evans in a March 5 news release. However, Mendelson did not call for Evans to resign.
“Our Code of Conduct states explicitly that a Councilmember ‘may not knowingly use the prestige of office or public position for [his] private gain,’ and that government resources shall not be used for personal business,” Mendelson said. “This reprimand will send a clear message that Mr. Evans’ actions are not only unacceptable but are inconsistent with the Council’s ethical standards.”
Councilmember David Grosso (I-At Large) disapproved of Mendelson’s plan to reprimand Evans, calling for a special council investigation into Evans’ alleged wrongdoing in a March 5 news release. 
“Chairman Mendelson’s proposed reprimand of Councilmember Evans is merely a slap on the wrist, allowing the Council to check a box and move on,” Grosso said. “It stops short of any real accountability as Councilmember Evans will remain at the helm of the powerful Finance and Revenue Committee from which he peddled his influence using the prestige of his office.”
A full investigation is unnecessary because Evans’ emails to businesses clearly demonstrated a violation of conduct, according to Mendelson.
“Some have suggested that I should appoint a special committee to investigate the matter,. However, there is no question whether Mr. Evans’ emails violated the Council’s Code of Conduct, and therefore waiting for an investigation would be an unnecessary delay,” Mendelson said in the news release. 
Evans’ behavior reflects poorly on the councils’ public image and makes it impossible for him to continue in his position, according to the letter. 
“The Council cannot afford to have decisions made by a committee as consequential as Finance and Revenue continue to be marred by questions of impropriety or influence peddling,” the letter said. “The Council also cannot have someone who is under grand jury investigation overseeing government ethics via a post on the Judiciary committee.”

Jewish Life at Georgetown celebrated its 50th anniversary March 22 with a special Shabbat that brought together current and former students and faculty to remember the history of the Jewish community at Georgetown University.
The event included Shabbat prayer services as well as speeches by students and administrators. Numerous Jewish alumni and professors attended the ceremony, and University President John J. DeGioia gave the opening address.
Jewish Life, the Jewish faith chaplaincy at Georgetown established in 1969, runs weekly Shabbat services, hosts celebrations of recognized holidays and organizes community events
Georgetown and its students have benefited from the contributions of the Jewish community and faith tradition, DeGioia said, referring to the Jewish concept of tikkun olam, which translates from Hebrew to literally mean “repair the world” and has to many become representative of the pursuit of social justice. 
“We have a richer understanding of what it means to be a university when we are inspired by the spirit of tikkun olam, and for this, we are all deeply grateful,” DeGioia said in his speech. “We are a stronger community because of the presence of this faith community.”
Reflecting on the past of the Jewish people is critical for the future of the community, according to Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), manager of special projects at the Museum of Jewish Heritage and a former historian for the Georgetown University Student Association.
“The stories and figures of our communal past contain powerful lessons for us,” Goldstein said in his speech. “Discerning those lessons is a job for each of us that we each must take on for ourselves as part of a collective conversation.” 
Jewish life on campus started in 1834, when the Marx Lazarus enrolled as the first Jewish student to attend Georgetown. Still, Jewish students faced significant barriers finding their way to the Hilltop long after. The university imposed a quota to limit the Jewish student population to five individuals each year throughout the earlier half of the 20th century.
Georgetown hired its first full-time rabbi in 1968, more than a century after Lazarus enrolled at the university. While the university had historically hired part-time rabbis, Rabbi Harold White became the first full-time rabbi at a Catholic university in the United States. 
White, who retired from Georgetown in 2010 and died in 2015, also played an important role in creating the university’s Center for Jewish Civilization — referred to as the Program for Jewish Civilization when it was founded. 
The CJC, a teaching and research center in the School of Foreign Service founded in 2003 that offers classes on Jewish civilization, is one of many outlets that have developed alongside Jewish Life to support the Jewish community on campus, including the Bayit LLC, a residential community to celebrate Jewish culture and heritage.
The Jewish chaplaincy’s primary goal has been to develop and connect Jewish students, according to its website.
“Jewish Life at Georgetown aspires to advance the life and growth of every self-defined Jewish student through building their sense of Jewish Connection, Confidence, and Concern,” the website reads.
Experiences at Georgetown foster a stronger sense of Jewish identity for many Jewish-identifying students on campus, according to Goldstein. 
“Virtually every single alumnus with whom I spoke told me that they graduated more knowledgeable, proud and engaged in Judaism than having entered Georgetown, and attending this Jesuit, Catholic school strengthened their Jewish identity,” Goldstein said in his speech.
Jewish Life is still grappling with the diversity of its community members, and opinions surrounding contentious issues like Israel continue to pose challenges, according to Katie Wysong (SFS ’19),  a member of the on-campus Jewish community. Acts of hate against the Jewish faith both at Georgetown and nationally also remind Jewish Life members of existential concerns for their community. 
“As our community has grown, these questions become more centrally engaged with,” Wysong said. “We also face external threats, with the swastikas drawn across campus and the Pittsburgh shooting last year demonstrating it all too clearly.”
This struggle and debate, however, has contributed to the strength of the Jewish community on campus, according to Wysong.
“However, out of those difficult moments and difficult conversations, we emerge stronger,” Wysong said in a speech. 
Though the event served to remember the Jewish community’s past on campus, it also served as a prayer for its continued strength and vitality at Georgetown, according to Rabbi Rachel Gartner, director for Jewish life on campus.
“Tonight we will celebrate the generations of Jewish Hoyas and our staff who have fuelled and fanned the flames of Jewish life so that it could shine as brightly and as powerfully as it does right now through the eyes of the myriad students in this very room tonight,” Gartner said at the event.

Georgetown University’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine erected an artistic representation of the 400 mile wall in the West Bank on campus as part of its 15th annual Israeli Apartheid Week to raise awareness about the Israeli state policies against Palestinian citizens.
Israeli Apartheid Week, which began April 1, is an international campaign across college campuses that strives to raise public support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. This year’s theme is “Stop Arming Colonialism.” Over 200 cities worldwide participate in IAW, according to its website.
The Palestinian-led BDS movement encourages the boycott of and divestment from Israeli businesses, cultural and academic institutions, and sanctions on the Israeli government. 
Georgetown’s SJP hosted events throughout the week to support the BDS movement and raise awareness of the plight of Palestinians in Israel, according to SJP. 
“We hope students understand how Israel’s separation wall, occupation of the West Bank, and illegal settlements therein are a manifestation of apartheid,” SJP wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “These policies have divided families, expropriated land, and violated the civil liberties and human rights of Palestinians.”
Israel built a 400-mile wall intended to bolster security along the West Bank in 2002 during the Second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, after a series of attacks killed 130 Israelis, according to The New York Times. With the violence along the West Bank having declined, the wall violates international law and the rights of self-determination, according to a 2004 advisory opinion of the International Criminal Court.
Students gathered to create a mock wall of art Monday, April 1, and it has been displayed in the Intercultural Center Galleria throughout the week. The construction aimed to represent the Israel barrier in the West Bank, according to SJP president Ahmad Al-Husseini (NHS ’20).
SJP hosted Former Syrian Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, Abdallah Al Dardari, on Tuesday, who spoke on the historical context of the Palestinian occupation and its impact on Syria, according to Al-Husseini. 
“He came and spoke about the occupation in Golan Heights and the relationship between Syria and Palestine and the intrinsic special bond that is there,” Al-Husseini said.
The event follows President Trump’s recent official acknowledgment of Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a region controlled by Syria until 1967. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, a move recognized by no other country until Trump’s announcement on March 21, according to The Washington Post. The United States is now the only state to officially recognize Israeli authority over this contested region.
SJP also held a panel Wednesday about the BDS movement, which featured speakers that included BDS leader Andrew Kadi and SJP activist Moath Elhady.
The international community has the responsibility to ensure the rights of Palestinians are protected, Kadi said at an event held by the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs in May 2018. 
“To me, BDS is a movement that is more about the international community. It’s a solidarity movement in the sense that we’re the ones who are complicit,” Kadi said. 
SJP hosted a charity dinner Thursday in McShain Lounge to raise money for Helping Hand for Relief and Development, an emergency and humanitarian aid organization, according to the HHRD website. At the dinner, students read poetry and celebrated Palestinian culture. 
The events of the week show the power of student organizing and collective action, Sonya Fares (COL ’22), an attendee of the charity dinner, said. 
“The topic is a highly contentious one that raises much debate, but I think any instance where students come together to share their perspective and spread their message is really great to see,” Fares said. 
The philanthropic dinner was an opportunity to celebrate Palestinian culture, according to Munir Pavez (SFS ’20), co-president of Georgetown University Arab Society, who performed at the event. 
“I’m glad SJP this year was able to hold a philanthropic event that focused on Palestinian culture, art, and solidarity,” Pavez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I helped lead dabke, a traditional Levantine line dance that, for Palestinians, has symbolized cooperation, determination and love for their heritage.” 
The IAW does not encourage dialogue and only tells one side of the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the Georgetown Israel Alliance wrote in an April 2 statement on Facebook.
“We are disappointed that this week’s events discourage dialogue and reject the Jewish connection to Israel in favor of a divisive, one-sided narrative,” GIA wrote. “To further our goal of dialogue, we will be tabling this week in Red Square so that members of the Georgetown community can engage with us on their views.”
Some of the week’s events have led to misunderstandings of SJP’s mission, according to Tara Nouri (SFS ’22), an SJP board member.
“We’ve had a lot of great interactions over this past week and a lot of bad interactions where people have not quite understood what our mission is here,” Nouri said. “We are interested in the uplifting of the Palestinian people for their equal treatment in the occupied territories.”
To conclude IAW, SJP will host a screening of the documentary “The Lobby,” which is about the influence of the Israel lobby in U.S. politics, on Friday.
Last year during IAW, a Palestinian flag hung in Red Square on April 1 was removed by unknown individuals April 3 and April 6. SJP filed two bias incident reports with university administration. 
GIA also reported five separate incidents regarding its Israeli flag, which was also hung in Red Square, during last year’s IAW. GIA filed bias reports with the administration after the Israeli flag was removed April 3, 4 and 6. The individual who removed the Israeli flag April 6 was apprehended by the Georgetown University Police Department.
This article was updated April 5 to correct the incidents of flag removal which occurred during IAW last year.

Adam Semprevivo (COL ’20) filed a lawsuit against Georgetown University Wednesday, as the university announced its intent to rescind his admission and dismiss him and one other student from the school in connection with the admissions bribery scheme.
Semprevivo is suing Georgetown for a wrongful disciplinary process following the university’s intent to dismiss him and one other student. (Full disclosure: Semprevivo previously served as a cartoonist for The Hoya.) The Department of Justice indicted 50 people, including parents of university students and administrators of college entrance exams, in the admissions bribery case March 12. Semprevivo’s father Stephen Semprevivo and former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst were both included in the indictment. 
Semprevivo’s father pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud May 7 after paying an intermediary $400,000 to have Ernst designate his son as a tennis recruit in the admissions process, according to the indictment. 
Georgetown imposed an undue disciplinary process in choosing not to follow its disciplinary procedures when deciding against Semprevivo, according to the lawsuit. Semprevivo, who claims he was not aware of his father’s payment, is imposing an injunction to prevent Georgetown from enforcing academic discipline, including expulsion, against him and revoking his academic credits from his three completed years at the university, according to the lawsuit.  
The prosecution at Semprevivo’s May 7 hearing presented email evidence of instructions William “Rick” Singer, who led the college admissions scheme, sent to Semprevivo and both of his parents about his application essay which falsely claimed Semprevivo played tennis, according to USA TODAY. 
Semprevivo is arguing the university is depriving him of due process, and that its disciplinary actions constitute a breach of contract, according to the suit.
Georgetown did not abide by its Honor Council System Procedures, which serve as a contract between students and Georgetown, in not following the university’s disciplinary process for Semprevivo, according to the lawsuit. 
The HCSP, however, did not apply to Semprevivo, because his application to Georgetown was falsified before he was enrolled as a student, according to an April 15 email listed in the lawsuit from Georgetown’s lawyer Adam Adler to Semprevivo’s counsel. 
Submitting inaccurate information on the Georgetown application qualifies students for expulsion, according to university spokesperson Meghan Dubyak. 
“Knowingly misrepresenting or falsifying credentials in an application can be cause for rescinding the admission of the student and dismissal from Georgetown,” Dubyak wrote in a Wednesday statement. “Today, we informed two students of our intent to rescind their admission and dismiss them from Georgetown.” 
Dubyak declined to name the students whose admissions were revoked, making it publicly unknown if Isabelle Henriquez (COL ’20), whose parents were also named in the March 12 indictment, is the second student Georgetown intends to dismiss. 
Singer pleaded guilty to four charges including racketeering conspiracy March 12. Singer’s college consulting company assisted student admission into universities including Yale University and Stanford University by facilitating bribes collected from parents that he distributed to college coaches. 
Semprevivo applied to Georgetown with a 1980 SAT score and a 4.067 weighted high school GPA, according to the complaint. While Singer did not assist Semprevivo on his academics or scores, he made arrangements with Ernst for Semprevivo to be falsely designated to the tennis team. Singer also submitted Semprevivo’s Georgetown application and typed his name into the signature box, according to the lawsuit. 

“Singer submitted Semprivivo’s application to Georgetown and typed in Semprevivo’s name in the signature block. At no time did Semprevivo ever sign the application,” the lawsuit said.  
David Kenner, Semprevivo’s attorney, hopes Semprevivo can either remain at Georgetown or leave the university with his three years worth of credit, according to NBC News. 
“Failing to get him back into Georgetown, we want him to be able to leave with credits intact with no negative reference in his transcripts,” Kenner said in an interview with NBC. “We don’t want three years wasted of his life.”

The problem with criminals like Adam Semprevivo is that they think that they can use their socioeconomic leverage to portray themselves through the media to be the victims.  We are not going to be your Judge Aaron Persky to your Brock Turner.
PERPETRATORS CANNOT BE THE VICTIMS NOR SHOULD THEY BE PORTRAYED AS SUCH!  The actual victims are the students, alum, faculty, staff, and applicants who were denied a rightful place at Georgetown because of criminal frauds like Semprevivo.  These scum deserve no place in our esteemed institution, and it thoroughly cheapens our degree and institution to even be associated with frauds like Semprevivo, Henriquez, Schuyler Hodge, and the 9 or so others who cheated their way into Georgetown.
If plagiarism can lead to rescinding of degrees, outright fraudulent admission is more than enough grounds for the same.
For Georgetown to be clean, administrators need to rescind degrees from the ALL involved in the scandal.  Semprevivo and the other student is a good start.  Now, GU needs to continue erasing the other stains from its history.

So first, there is absolutely no equivalency between rape and cheating college admissions. Your comparison diminishes the gravity of rape and is an insult to survivors. 
Second, everything hinges on whether Adam Semprevivo knew the role his dad played in cheating admissions. If he was referred to the admissions office as a tennis recruit, but his own application didn’t reflect any tennis experience whatsoever, then why didn’t Georgetown admissions notice the huge discrepancy? They are complicit at worst or incompetent at best. 
I believe his degree should be rescinded, and I also have no sympathy for the other Georgetown student caught cheating admissions because she clearly did know. 
But I also sympathize if his side of the story holds out. There is every indication, based on his application, to believe that he didn’t knowingly cheat his way into Georgetown. If that is the case, and he woke up one day to find his life ruined and his name permanently tarred, then I feel bad even as I realize he must be expelled. 
Finally, don’t get so angry. You seem to be led by your own emotion and not reason, and that’s rarely a good mix for decision-making.

It is unfortunate that Adam was caught up in this mess, but I don’t see where he is owed ‘due process.’ Due process is a legal process that someone is appropriating for their use. Georgetown, as a private institution, can choose to remove Adam or not. But this entire mess has highlighted what many have known for a long time; money talks. Adam may or may not have had prior knowledge, but his admission is now in question, as are the admissions of all others whose parents took these extraordinary and illegal steps. Federal law will hopefully deal with the parents. The schools can argue they knew nothing about what was happening, but if they want to prove they have the ethical high ground there is no choice but to remove any and all students who benefited from the bribery. Otherwise, those who are not admitted or not situated financially as well as the Semprevivos’ apparently are will see this as just another in their schools corporatization/corruption. Georgetown has enough corporatization to deal with without trying to explain this away.

It appears that Adam Semprevivo wants to be an exception to a very basic tenet in Western law — one cannot benefit (directly or indirectly) from the proceeds or the results of a crime. He would likely lose his lawsuit just on this ground. 
Secondly, he (not Singer) per the federal charging documents against his father sent an email to Ernst about his tennis prowess and how he “hopes” to play tennis, in which email (sent in August 2015) Adam Semprevivo claims to have had a summer of “terrific success in doubles” ! So Adam *knew* he was a putative tennis and not a basketball recruit and his claims of “innocence” are hollow. 
Yes, Georgetown did not dismiss him when it forced Ernst to resign but that may been because the school was aware of the coach’s not abiding by atheletic recruitment guidelines but was unaware of the crimes of bribery perpetrated by Ernst.
Finally, his credentials aren’t so outstanding as to have earned him a place at Georgetown without his father’s actions. 
Had Adam Semprevivo been contrite and remorseful he may have earned my sympathy. But suing your father’s victim and displaying the attitude of entitlement does not sit well with me. He simply cannot expect to benefit as a result of a crime.

Georgetown isn’t gonna be clean until they fire Jack DeGioa and reorganize the university completely. 
Internal controls and accountability at the university are a joke.
Example: Former Professor Yossi Shain used $50,000 of University Funds for personal travel back and forth between Israel and the USA.

The polarization of political discourse is a concerning trend in a time where there are growing antisemitic sentiments in the United States, panelists said at a dialogue about American Jews in the era of the President Donald Trump administration Sept. 3.
The event titled “Loyal/Disloyal? American Judaism in the Era of the Trump Presidency,” which was sponsored by Georgetown University’s Center for Jewish Civilization, featured notable experts who remarked on Trump’s evocation of the antisemetic trope of “dual loyalty” of American Jews between the United States and Israel. 
At a press conference with the president of Romania on Aug. 21, Trump stated American Jews would be disloyal to Jewish people and Israel if they voted for a Democrat in the upcoming election, according to The New York Times. His remark was criticized for evoking an antisemitic trope that the American Jewish community have a dual loyalty and are more faithful to Israel than their own country. 
While no panelist drew an explicit connection between Trump’s statements and the rise in antisemitic hate crimes addressed at the event, they agreed there has been a recent shift in how people approach current political discourse reflected in the rhetoric of political leaders.
Unclear and careless rhetoric makes room for antisemitism and stops individuals from criticizing like-minded peers, according to Senior Fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings Institution Tamara Cofman Wittes.
“I think that our broader political discourse and the way it has degraded has created a permissive environment,” Wittes said. “The permissive environment not only may deter people from calling out those in their own camp, but it also makes it easier for the real haters to insinuate this content into the political discourse in ways that other people may be uneducated enough to fall prey to.”
Other panelists included Director of the CJC at the School of Foreign Service Jacques Berlinerblau, visiting professor of contemporary antisemitism and CJC Senior Fellow Ira Forman and Senior Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute Danielle Pletka.
The number of hate crime incidents targeting Jews and Jewish institutions in the United States rose 37% in the year following Trump’s inauguration, according to data released by the FBI. The number of hate crimes on Georgetown’s campus surged 275% in 2017. Antisemitic graffiti was found in restrooms outside Makóm, the Jewish prayer space, in May 2017, and swastikas were found spray-painted in bathrooms in LXR Hall during Rosh Hashanah the same year.
The recent rise in antisemitic hate crimes in the United States corresponds with a growing partisan divide in the country, Wittes told Tuesday’s audience. 
“If we’re talking about the situation of American Jews, what has changed is the well documented rise in antisemitic hate crimes, both violent and nonviolent,” Wittes said. “I would say that is part of a context in our American political discourse that has become more polarized, coarser, unrestrained and corrosive of some of the bonds that hold us together as a country.”
“Antisemitism is a scourge, and the politicization of it and the politicization of everything is to our detriment,” Pletka said. “We need to be able to have a conversation and a dialogue across different ideologies and across different political persuasions and religious persuasions. The more that we try to use it as a tool that we can hang around the necks of our political adversaries, the more that it becomes a problem that we neither talk about in an intelligent way nor seek solutions to.”
Politicizing topics such as antisemitism impedes effective discourse between those with varying political beliefs, Pletka said.
The Muslim and Jewish communities on Georgetown’s campus have supported each other in response to antisemitic and Islamophobic attacks. After the attack at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October 2018, the Muslim Student Association delivered handwritten letters of support to Jewish students and faculty. Members of the Jewish community responded in solidarity by chalking positive messages in Red Square.
Citizens have a duty to stand up against those who put forward antisemitic, racist and sexist sentiments, according to Pletka.
“The worst of the worst are in a category of their own,” Pletka said. “It is those who excuse them, those who create room for them in society, those that tolerate them, are the ones that enable this to spread.”

Republicans and Democrats should work together to ensure the United States and Israel maintain a mutually beneficial relationship to benefit the future success of both countries, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) said at a Nov. 20 event.
At the event “Rep. Gottheimer: The Democrats and the US-Israel Relationship,” Gottheimer discussed the current state of affairs between the United States and Israel regarding each nation’s economy and national security. Georgetown University College Democrats and Georgetown Israel Alliance co-sponsored the Wednesday event. 
Gottheimer serves as co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan coalition that seeks to address congressional dilemmas. He also co-sponsored the U.S.-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act in July, which authorizes joint research and cooperation programs between the U.S. and Israel. 
Israel has long been a U.S. ally in the Middle East since the United States was the first nation to recognize Israel as a state in 1948 and Jerusalem as its capital in 2017. Remaining allies are necessary for regional protection and the international economy in both countries, according to Gottheimer.
“This relationship is essential to our national security and important to the region,” Gottheimer said. “Part of what is so important in the U.S.-Israel relationship is the economic relationship.”
From a U.S. political perspective, Republicans and Democrats should collaborate to develop policies that effectively navigate the U.S.-Israeli relationship, according to Gottheimer.
“The U.S.-Israeli relationship has always been a bipartisan issue and we must make sure this remains bipartisan,” Gottheimer said. 
The event comes after Israeli and Islamist forces on the Gaza Strip agreed to a tentative ceasefire Nov. 14 after two days of fighting between the groups. This ceasefire was threatened two days later, however, as Hamas, a Palestinian political and militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, launched two missiles into Israeli territory that were struck down by Israeli Air Defense systems, according to The Washington Post.
Certain news outlets have mischaracterized the nature of recent violence between Israel and Hamas, according to Gottheimer. 
“I think the media, depending on the outlet, are portraying this as an attack on the Palestinian side and forgetting that Israel is responding and not being proactive in their use of force,” Gottheimer said. 
Gottheimer also addressed the recent prevalence of antisemitism across the United States. Gottheimer has witnessed antisemitic hate crimes in schools in his district and while campaigning for his House seat, he said. 
“In only the last few months, we have had six swastikas found in middle schools,” Gottheimer said. “I’m used to swastikas on my campaign signs and have faced comments questioning my loyalty to the USA as a Jew.”
After President Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017, hate crimes targeting Jews and Jewish institutions rose 37% in the United States. Several antisemitic events occurred at Georgetown in 2017, including antisemitic graffiti discovered near Makóm, the Jewish prayer space, and swastikas spray-painted in LXR Hall during Rosh Hashana the same year.
The growing trend of antisemitic sentiment in the United States has been exacerbated by social media, according to Gottheimer. 
“A simmering cauldron of anger has been unleashed because people feel they can say whatever they want and hide behind social media like cowards,” Gottheimer said. 
In a recent development in U.S.-Israeli foreign policy, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Nov. 18 that Trump’s administration determined Israeli settlements in the West Bank do not violate international law. More than 700,000 settlers reside in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, both of which are in regions claimed by Palestine. The announcement breaks with decades of preceding U.S. foreign policy, according to The Washington Post.
After Gottheimer addressed Georgetown community members, Maurice Zekaria (SFS ’21), a leader of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, led a question and answer period. A productive and impactful conversation came out of the event, according to Zekaria.
“I think it was a great event and a lot of people came out with diverse opinions,” Zekaria said in an interview with The Hoya. “It was a great exchange of ideas.” 
The event exemplified Georgetown student interest in the U.S.-Israeli relationship, Gottheimer said in an interview with The Hoya.
“There was a room full of very thoughtful students who asked many poignant questions,” Gottheimer said. “I am looking forward to coming back to Georgetown to address U.S. and Israel related issues.”

Rapid evolutions in cyberwarfare and the advent of climate change require new, sustainable methods for delivering aid to vulnerable populations, Head of Policy and Humanitarian Diplomacy of the International Committee of the Red Cross Hugo Slim said at an event Tuesday.
The Institute for the Study of International Migration, a Georgetown University research center, held the event titled “War and Humanitarian Action in the 2020s” in McGhee Library in the Intercultural Center on Feb. 11. During his talk, Slim discussed the implications of modern warfare and the evolving aid practices in his role at the ICRC. 
The ICRC organizes numerous assistance programs to support vulnerable populations affected by conflicts, according to its website. The ICRC has recently committed to integrating economic, social and environmental sustainability into their aid projects.
Developments in cybertechnology have led aid organizations like the Red Cross to reevaluate their traditional wartime policies, according to Slim. 
“I think one other thing that’s worrying us at the ICRC is, if so much warfare is going to happen in virtual space — in cyber attacks through computer systems — how can we embody and make present in that space humanitarian norms, humanitarian regulations?” Slim said. “How can we sort of flag and put a Red Cross or a Red Cross Crescent on a hospital in cyberspace?”
The anonymous nature of cyberweapons has complicated battlefield dynamics and raised concerns about accountability, according to Slim.
“We’ve always had false flags and covert operations — hidden operations — in warfare,” Slim said during the event. “Cyber seems to particularly require anonymity because you don’t want the other person knowing how you’re in or that you’re in or who’s in that system.” 
The increase in self-operating weapons has generated human desire to control the deadly technology, according to Slim. 
“We are saying that, for us, human control means that at any time, when these very sophisticated weapons are in operation across a battle space, semi-autonomously or whatever, many at the same time, there must still be the ability for human command to set the scope of their activities,” Slim said. 
Over 30 countries have defensive supervised autonomous weapons, according to The New York Times. A well-known example of the autonomous weapons, the Israel Aerospace Industries Harpy, is designed to crash into the sources of enemy radar signals without a direct human command. Such weapons can destroy their targets before a human-directed counter strike can be deployed.
Prior to joining the ICRC in 2015, Slim served as a senior research fellow at the University of Oxford, researching humanitarian ethics and civilian protection. He has also authored several books, with his most recent, “Humanitarian Ethics: A Guide to the Morality of Aid in War and Disaster,” being released in 2015.
Worsening global climate trends also necessitate a transformation in humanitarian policy, Slim said. Humanitarian organizations must pivot toward better long-term aid practices.
“We’re asked to do it in a sustainable way. We’ve got to keep that system continuity going as well so it’s not just someone giving somebody a glass of water anymore,” Slim said. “We’re gonna make things that you can go on using. This is not a ‘truck-and-chuck’ operation. We’re gonna try and create systems of water, food, health, whatever, that continue. And of course the last one is we have to adapt to climate change and green our own organization. It’s a new ethic for us, to green the ICRC.”
In the face of cyber warfare proliferation, personal interactions between war victims and aid workers must remain a central focus of humanitarian work, according to Slim. 
“What really changes what we are to one another is contact, that face-to-face contact,” Slim said. “We know from decades of humanitarian advocacy that it is the face, not the numbers, that make the difference.”

Miko Peled, a Jewish pro-Palestinian writer and activist who has been accused of posting antisemitic tweets, spoke at an event Sunday despite widespread condemnation from students and campus organizations.
Peled’s invitation to speak virtually at Georgetown University provoked backlash, resulting in a petition led by the Georgetown Israel Alliance, a campus organization promoting education and discussion about current events and issues surrounding Israel and the Middle East. The petition was signed by over 130 students and three other student organizations asking the university to cancel the event for giving a platform to a speaker with a history of antisemitism without allowing other voices to contest his beliefs.
The petition, signed by Georgetown University College Democrats, the Jewish Student Association, the fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi and GIA, as well as individual students, claimed Peled’s previous remarks constitute hate speech.
“While it is important that a variety of opinions and perspectives are represented in a discussion of the Israel-Palestine conflict, Mr. Peled’s rhetoric crosses a line into hate speech, as demonstrated by his social media accounts and speeches at past events,” the petition reads.
On a Georgetown Zoom webinar titled “Anti-Zionism vs. Anti-Semitism”, Peled spoke about the Israel-Palestine conflict and discussed how he delineates where anti-Zionism ends and antisemitism begins. Anti-Zionism is generally defined as a political ideology in opposition to the state of Israel, whereas antisemitism is prejudice against the Jewish people.
President of GU-Qatar SJP Zain Assaf (SFS ’23) moderated the conversation with Peled.
“The groups that oppose my views and wanted to silence the event at Georgetown did not act because they are Jewish. Their opposition is a result of their Zionism, a racist, violent ideology,” Peled wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The work that is being done by students for justice in Palestine is heroic.”
GU SJP and GU-Q SJP did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.
The petition said Peled’s past comments reflect antisemitism. In tweets from 2016 cited in the petition, he compared the Israel Defense Forces to Nazi Germany’s Gestapo and referred to Jewish people as “sleazy thieves” in reference to U.S. aid to Israel.
Despite the petition’s concerns, Peled did not infringe Gerogetown’s Speech and Expression policy, so administrators did not intervene, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown University is committed to the free and open exchanges of ideas, even if those ideas may be found difficult or objectionable by some,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Faculty members and student groups with access to benefits may invite any outside speaker or guest to speak on campus or at a virtual event. An appearance of any speaker or guest on campus, or at a Georgetown virtual event, is not an endorsement by Georgetown University.”
While the university is committed to the principle of free speech, it also stands against bigotry, hatred and racism, according to a university spokesperson.
“While we affirm that open discourse, discussion and debate are essential components of academic life — we also have foundational values that stand in clear opposition to bigotry, hatred, and racism, and in clear support of assuring that every student is welcomed and respected in our community,” a university spokesperson wrote.
However, the petition argued that the event does not promote free speech because of its webinar format. Although there was a Q and A portion of the event, students could not interact with Peled face-to-face.
“While in normal times we would move to condemn this event and then try to engage with the speaker/attendees regarding their antisemtic viewpoints, the use of Georgetown’s webinar function makes it impossible for attendees to directly interact with the speak or other attendees,” the petition read. 
Although the petition took the position that the format of the event should be changed, the event went forward as planned.
During the conversation with GU SJP presidents, Peled suggested antisemitism and anti-Zionism do not overlap and instead stand in opposition to one another. 
“The title could just as well have been the difference between racism and anti-racism. Antisemitism is a form of racism,” Peled said. “Anti-Zionism is a struggle against or a stance against a racist political ideology. Zionism is a racist political ideology.” 
Peled also compared the Israeli-Palestinian divide to aparthied and accused the Israeli government of genocide and ethnic cleansing.   
“If you believe in the rights of humans — rights in general — if you believe in the rights of refugees to return to their homes, and be given restitution and compensation, if you believe that people should have a right to equality, then you cannot but oppose and reject Zionism,” Peled said.
Rebecca Stekol (SFS ’21), co-president of JSA — one of the four organizations that signed the petition — said the event’s choice to only allow Peled’s definition of anti-Zionism and antisemitism to be heard is dangerous because people may think Peled’s opinion is held by all Jewish people. (Full disclosure: Stekol formerly served as a deputy opinion editor and an opinion columnist for The Hoya.)
“More than anything, it was a careless choice,” Stekol wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am disappointed in their planning of this event because it is wrong to ask one Jewish person, who espouses views that have crossed into antisemitism, to paint an umbrella definition of what is and is not antisemitism.”
Stekol added that SJP could have invited other speakers to talk about Zionism who would have better acknowledged that the intersection between anti-Zionism and antisemitism is a complex topic. 
“That is an ongoing dialogue among the entire Jewish community, and there is not just one definition that neatly fits anti-Zionism and antisemitism into separate boxes, because the line is easily blurred,” Stekol wrote. “We need to retain agency over this dialogue. In addition, there are many other progressive, pro-Palestine Jews that SJP could have reached out to who do not espouse antisemitic rhetoric.”
During the Q and A portion of the event, a student confronted Peled by accusing him of antisemitism and bringing up his past tweets, including one from 2016 and a 2019 tweet in which he called Zionism a sign of dual loyalty to the governments of the United States and Israel. Peled denied he was antisemitic and said he had never made antisemitic statements.
“The question that you have submitted, that you or somebody submitted to you to ask, is false. None of it is true. None of it happened. I did not express any form of antisemitism in any of my expressions at all, ever,” Peled said.
Stekol expressed disappointment with how the event was ultimately allowed to proceed and said inviting a speaker who uses antisemitic rhetoric devalues the important conversation about where the line between anti-Zionism and antisemitism lies.
“In my time at Georgetown I have engaged in many meaningful dialogues about Israel/Palestine with students along a wide spectrum of opinions.” Stekol wrote. “Even though Peled is Jewish, Jews can hold antisemitic beliefs, and it is tokenizing and harmful to have him as the sole representation of Jewish voices at this event.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said that the president of Georgetown University Students for Justice in Palestine moderated the event alongside the president of GU Qatar SJP, who in fact was the only person to speak with Peled. The article has been updated to reflect this information.

As a former adjunct teacher at the University of California at Irvine, I had the chance to attend one of Peled’s speaking events there years ago. He is a hot-tempered radical who has turned his back on his own country and aligned himself with those seeking to destroy the Jewish state. When he spoke at UCI, he objected to my videotaping him, which was my right in a public event in a public venue. As for his friends in the SJP, they are a bunch of brown shirts, who use disruption, bullying, and intimidation to silence their opponents. I have personally witnessed their disruptive tactics on campus. He has a strange concept of heroes.
Peled has the right of free speech. At the same time, we have the right to speak out against him.

To insult Miko Peled with the accusation of  anti-Semitism,  a man whose grandfather signed Israel’s Declaration of Independence and whose niece was killed by a Palestinian suicide bomber, is beyond the pale.  Your whole line of rhetoric is just your way of avoiding a look in the mirror he is holding up.  Easier to accuse him of anti-Semitism than address the facts.  When you find justification in the Torah for the Zionist actions against Palestinians for 74 years, maybe you will have an audience.  Until then, don’t insult a man of truth and justice with such a petulant rejection.  I guarantee you if there was a speaker who was spewing hateful Zionist rhetoric against Palestinians, you would have welcomed him or her to campus with open arms!

The Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University welcomed five new members to its advisory board to aid in efforts to reshape the school’s representation and inclusion policies.
The new members, voted onto the SFS Board of Advisors on March 25, will contribute to an ongoing review process intended to identify ways for the SFS community to represent a more diverse group of people, according to Joel Hellman, dean of the SFS. The board, including the new appointees, consists of 43 members who are SFS graduates, parents of current students or community members. The board’s role is to guide the dean’s office and the school administration in areas like fundraising and outreach across graduate and parent networks. 
The new appointments highlight an increase in representation of people from different career paths, backgrounds and identities, according to Alma Caballero (SFS ’13, GRD ’15), one of the new board members. 
“I think that this is a testament to the efforts that Dean Hellman and the university are trying to conduct in bringing much more of that diversity, and it’s not only a diversity of ethnicity but also diversity of thought and a diversity of experience and a diversity of background, so I think that’s a positive step forward,” Caballero said in a video interview with The Hoya.
Caballero, who will be the youngest member ever to serve on the board, comes from a background in global consulting with a focus on Latin America and currently serves as the regional director for northern Latin America at McLarty Associates, a global strategy advisory firm in Washington, D.C. 
“The fact that I was nominated and voted to be part of the board is a substantial change because it’s the first time that a young alumni will be part of the board,” Caballero said. 
The incoming board members were elected in part because of their commitment to the Georgetown University community and because they bring different perspectives from those who have been historically represented on the board, according to Hellman.
“We are in the process of reviewing the role of the board, and in that process, we thought it was important to bring on right away a group of more diverse voices into the board so that they can be part of that discussion,” Hellman said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. 
The process of becoming a board member includes prior engagement with the SFS for some time and in different capacities, such as participating in coffee chats or planning for the school’s centennial activities, according to Hellman. 
The board must explore why certain demographics are underrepresented in the student body of the SFS, according to Zaid Zaid (SFS ’97), one of the new board members. Zaid currently works as the lead on Facebook’s North America strategic response policy team on U.S. politics and elections and previously served in the Obama administration.
“The number of Black students that are in SFS every year is low, and part of that means that we need to do better recruitment,” Zaid said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “Part of it means that we need to think about why students at Georgetown are choosing other schools, but I’m not sure what the answer is yet.”
Across all four undergraduate schools, 6.3% of Georgetown students identify as Black, 9.5% of students identify as Hispanic or Latino and 10.4% of students identify as Asian, according to the university’s 2019-20 Campus Demographics Survey. An additional 48.8% of undergraduates identify as white. 
The board is also welcoming Nick Talwar (SFS ’95), who currently serves as the president and CEO of the technology investment platform CircleUp, and Brionne Dawson (SFS ’02), who works in diplomatic and foreign policy at the Bureau for Economic and Business Affairs at the U.S. Department of State. 
Also joining the board is Lulu Garcia-Navarro (SFS ’94), the host of “Weekend Edition Sunday” and the news podcast “Up First: at NPR. Garcia-Navarro has also worked as a foreign correspondent in Brazil, Israel, Mexico and Iraq.
A more diverse student body in the SFS will change the demographics of the next generation of foreign service officers, according to Garcia-Navarro. 
“Elite institutions need to make room at the table for different kinds of students,” Garcia-Navarro said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “The School of Foreign Service has such a very close relationship with the cadre of the State Department in this country. Because of that close relationship, it is even more incumbent on the School of Foreign Service to really open up the ranks to other types of people because that will help shape actually how the American government itself functions.”

In the pigment print titled “Okuniewicz,” a suit-clad Clark Kent, Superman’s alter ego, sits above a background of speckled matzo bread. Above Kent’s raised eyebrow and blue-toned hair is typography telling the story of a Jewish immigrant changing his last name to Kent. For artist Gail Rebhan, the piece calls attention to how American culture has obscured Jewish identity.
The print, along with nearly 70 other pieces of artwork from over 40 different artists, is part of an exhibition titled “Jewish Authenticity and Identity.” The exhibition, curated by Georgetown University professor Ori Soltes, is being presented both virtually and in person at the Adas Israel Congregation, the largest conservative synagogue in Washington, D.C., and explores the concept of identity within Jewish culture.
For Soltes, pieces such as “Okuniewicz” highlight the exhibition’s broader goal to examine Jewish culture and identity in the world.
“The backdrop is Passover matzo, that quintessential gastronomic element that is associated with remembering who you are, where you came from,” Soltes said in a Zoom interview with The Hoya. “It’s all a play on that idea of identity, and to what extent do I give up or retain my Jewish identity.”
Soltes, who teaches at the Center for Jewish Civilization, an academic program within the School of Foreign Service that aims to promote the study of Judaism as it pertains to foreign policy, religion and culture, began selecting pieces for the exhibition between January and April 2020, with hundreds of artists, nearly half of whom live near the District, submitting their work for consideration.
In addition to creating an environment to hold dialogue on Jewish identity and culture, the exhibition also examines the role of Jewish artists in the world, according to Soltes.
“The given was if you’re submitting work to be considered for this exhibit, you consider yourself Jewish, by whatever way you know. Completely secular, completely orthodox, whatever in between,” Soltes said. “So it doesn’t require for me to define how it’s Jewish, but what it requires of me is that I explore how it’s Jewish.”
The exhibition helped featured artists reflect on their own identity, according to exhibition director Robert Bettman, who originally conceived the exhibit’s concept and later asked Soltes to join as lead curator. 
“One of the things that we have all experienced is real difficulty in navigating our identities,” Bettman said in a phone interview with The Hoya. “It feels like there’s not a lot of opportunity for overtly Jewish artists. You can be a successful artist, but if you speak about your identity in any way, it feels like there’s not a lot of room there.”
Soltes said he was surprised by the range and variety of submissions to the exhibition, especially regarding the subject matter of submissions, which addressed topics of gender, civil rights and immigration policies. While some pieces included in “Authenticity and Identity” date back to the early 1970s, others are more contemporary, including photographs and collages from 2020. 
The exhibit additionally allows viewers to examine the evolution of Jewish art, including both form and style, as well as historical influences, according to the exhibit’s introductory essay, “The Issue of Jewish Art and Identity,” written by Soltes. 
With “Authenticity and Identity,” Soltes specifically sought to organize the artwork in terms of both the chronological journey of the Jewish diaspora as well as artists’ interpretation of the diffusion of Jewish identity throughout the world. 
“I kind of moved chronologically into the post-biblical diasporic world of Jews, so the history, but then also embedded in that history there were kind of two ideas,” Soltes said. “One, what are the essential sort of values and concepts that have been addressed within the Jewish tradition and, therefore, being addressed by a number of these artists. And secondly, what has been the Jewish experience in the diaspora that, into some degree, is being addressed by these artists.”
While the in-person exhibit will remain installed in the lobby of Adas Israel Congregation through May 14, the virtual presentation can be accessed online at any time. The combination of formats has allowed conversation around the exhibit to flourish, according to Bettman.
“It feels to me like the most important thing that’s occurred is that we, who have been part of this exhibit, have been brought into dialogue with each other in a way that allows us to be our identities in diverse ways, and that feels really successful. That feels really good to me,” Bettman said.
While seeing art in person is often preferable, the exhibition’s online format offered a unique opportunity to curate an intentional and meaningful viewing experience for the audience, according to Soltes.
“The nice thing about the online exhibit is it can follow the conceptual order of the catalog, and so someone can see the exhibit as I ideally would want you to see it,” Soltes said. “If you choose to go from beginning to end, you’re kind of walking along with me in the way I was thinking about it.”

The Georgetown University Graduate Student Government (GradGov) will not sponsor a trip to Israel next month following internal controversy and university intervention. 
This semester, GradGov President Jonah Klempner (GRD ’22, LAW ’22) attempted to organize a trip to Israel across all graduate schools for the first time. Klempner planned the trip through itrek, a New York-based nonprofit that coordinates and subsidizes student-led group trips to Israel. 
Itrek only provides funding for students who apply through certain programs; Klempner hoped to expand access for all students by creating a subsidy program funded by the GradGov budget. 
In early February, however, the university prohibited GradGov from funding a subsidy because Klempner had not gone through the required financial and general vetting and review, according to a university spokesperson. This ban followed pushback from Klempner’s fellow GradGov members, who expressed concerns about cost disparities among trip participants, as well as the destination of the trip itself. 
The itrek trip is still scheduled to take place during spring break but without university or GradGov support. 
Given the limited funding available through itrek, Klempner proposed to the student government’s budget committee that $30,000 of GradGov student activity funds be used to subsidize the trip for students who could not apply to itrek’s STEM and Policy subsidization program, according to an email from GradGov senator Jillian Robins (GRD ’23) to all GradGov Senators, obtained by The Hoya. 
“GradGov Senators, outside the STEM and Policy coverage will get a substantial subsidy from GradGov to help cover the $2,400 dollar cost of the trip,” according to the trip application.
While the application limited the subsidy to GradGov senators, the subsidy actually proposed in the budget would have allowed all students to apply, regardless of relationship to GradGov, Klempner said.
Still, there were concerns over the fact that the trip’s student leaders — including Klempner — would not have to pay as much while other trip participants would, according to Robins, who also represents the Arab studies program.
The four trip leaders, who were recommended by Klempner but ultimately approved by itrek, would plan and lead the trip. This meant that these leaders would receive a subsidy from itrek, according to a document obtained by The Hoya. 
Klempner denied handling GradGov funds or using GradGov funds in an unethical manner after the university pulled funding.
“I never touch money from GradGov or itrek, no GradGov funds were apportioned, and the trip can and will take place without GradGov,” Klempner wrote to The Hoya. “I volunteered and was chosen as an itrek trip leader months before I volunteered and was elected GradGov president.”
Administrators from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) made it clear to GradGov that GradGov funds could not be allocated toward the itrek trip, according to a university spokesperson.
The university ultimately has the final decision on how student organizations manage their funds, according to Alexander Sens, dean of the GSAS.
“It is therefore, just a matter of pure fact, legally, ethically and financially the university’s money, and we have a fiduciary responsibility to oversee the use of that money,” Sens said at a Feb. 18 GradGov meeting. 
The university did not specify the exact errors Klempner committed in the vetting process. 
In addition to the funding structure, students also expressed concerns about the trip’s destination, according to Robins.
“If it were solely for professional development, why does it need to go to Israel? Why does it need to go to an apartheid state?” Robins said. “Why couldn’t it be held in New York or in D.C. or on campus for that reason? There are plenty of opportunities for professional development that would be cheaper and not involving an apartheid state.”
Amnesty International, a human rights non-governmental organization, recently declared Israel to be an apartheid state. Israel commits crimes against humanity and imposes institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians, prevents travel through checkpoints and displaces Palestinians. 
Nooran Alhamdan (GRD ’22), a graduate student in the Arab studies program, said it is important for students to understand the complicated relations of the Israel-Palestine region.
“I know that we’re all students and money is short, and this is something that is normal for a person to want to go on an all-expense-paid trip, but my message to students would be to please do your research,” Alhamdan told The Hoya.
Klempner affirmed at a meeting about the trip that the students who were against the trip were not motivated by antisemitism or bigotry.  
Daniel Schoolenberg (GRD ’22), set to be a leader of the trip alongside Klempner, said that the immersive experience of the trip would be valuable for all students.
“I think everyone will gain an understanding about an extremely important and dynamic part of the world that they wouldn’t be able to get otherwise,” Schoolenberg wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The trip’s educational purposes would align with GradGov’s constitution and would aim to facilitate dialogue and learning among participants, according to Klempner.
“This educational trip which includes leaders, students, and speakers from all faiths and backgrounds, features a series of compassionate dialogues,” Klempner wrote.
This article was updated on Feb. 25 to clarify details about the trip’s application/structure and correct details about Israel’s status as an apartheid state and student concerns about the trip.

Richard Cravatts says 
March 13, 2022 at 6:50 pm
This had nothing to do with budgets and everything to do with targeted bigotry toward Israel and an effort to sever ties with the world community in the name of Palestinian solidarity.
“We, a coalition of graduate and undergraduate students at Georgetown University, are pleased to declare that we successfully blocked $30,000 of student funding from financing a trip to Israel with the pro-Israel organization, itrek, and fully cut the trip’s institutional links to Georgetown University and the university’s Graduate Student Government (GradGov), in line with BDS principles of academic boycott.”

The Muslim Law Students Association (MLSA) wrote a letter Feb. 28 to Georgetown University Law Center (GULC) administrators calling for action to address one professor’s racist and Islamophobic class conduct.  
The letter — which has garnered signatures from 286 Georgetown students, almost 30 student organizations and 24 non-GULC bar associations as of March 3 — asks for increased administrative representation and curriculum changes. The letter describes discriminatory conduct toward Muslim students by Susan Deller Ross, a tenured professor who teaches courses in international and comparative law on women’s human rights and is the director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic. 
The authors of the letter, which were a group of MLSA members, gathered information from decades of coursework in Ross’ classes, citing dozens of excerpts from the required textbook she authored and exam questions she wrote. The authors wrote that the content they gathered represents a holistic picture of Ross’ racist and Islamophobic beliefs. 
The letter requests that Ross’ course curriculum be modified and reviewed by a Muslim expert, according to Hamsa Fayed (LAW ’23), a member of MLSA.
“It is quite clear from our 17-page memo and content of our statement that Prof. Ross is not able to objectively evaluate any question relating to Muslims and their practice without injecting dangerously Islamophobic rhetoric into her teachings/examinations, thus we also ask that she refrain from the use of those topics in her class lectures and examinations,” Fayed wrote to The Hoya.
MLSA’s demands include mandating anti-Islamophobia and anti-discrimination specific training for all GULC faculty, reserving a seat for an MLSA representative on the committee that appoints GULC faculty, and creating a clear and direct internal system for students to anonymously file complaints for the administration to investigate.
Past coursework that MLSA marked as promoting islamophobic rhetoric included a 2020 exam that asked students to advocate for the Hindutva Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), an extremist right-wing party responsible for mass lynchings of Muslims in India and Kashmir. 
The exam question distressed and harmed many students, according to MLSA member Maheen Haq (LAW ’23).
“How do you expect someone like a Muslim person to take that exam?” Haq said in an interview with The Hoya. “Members of my family have died and you’d be expected to take this exam and advocate on behalf of a party that has done lynchings of your community.”
Ross said her coursework does not specifically target Muslim students and focuses on international and human rights law.
“My courses and casebook sections concerning discrimination against women in marriage,
divorce, and inheritance cover many statutes, whether they stem from the Catholic, Protestant, 
Mormon, Jewish, Muslim, or Hindu religion or from ethnic customs or from cultural beliefs that 
women should be subordinate to men,” Ross wrote to The Hoya. “I am not against any religion or ethnicity.”
Being forced to argue on behalf of Islamophobic laws and rules, as the letter states Ross encourages students to do in the clinic, could cause students to begin applying those ideas to their careers and lives, Haq said.  
“This will influence your policy choices, it’s going to influence how you do so many different things,” Haq said. “For example, she asked students to advocate against the right for women to wear a hijab, and she taught students how to use international doctrines and treaties to make that argument. That’s just sick.”
Fayed felt as though she had to act against her beliefs and morals in order to perform well in Ross’ clinic, according to a video posted on the GULC MLSA instagram page.
“This all really tore me apart after a while especially since a lot of those stances were fundamentally against my belief systems and my identity as a human rights advocate,” Fayed said in the video. “I was ashamed of myself, ashamed to call myself an advocate for social justice, ashamed to be a Muslim, ashamed that I wasn’t defending myself as a proud Muslim, ashamed of what I had enabled from being silent, ashamed that I feared speaking out because I was the only one in the room that felt this way, ashamed that those fellow students would invalidate me because I was a nobody in comparison to the decorated and accomplished professor Susan Ross.”  
Jinan Chehade (LAW ’23), another member of MLSA who raised concerns about Ross’ insensitive course content alongside Haq, said the administration did not provide an adequate response.
GULC prioritizes making classrooms inclusive environments with respectful dialogue, according to William Treanor, dean of GULC.
“We received the letter and have been in touch with the student leaders and individuals involved,” Treanor wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Georgetown Law is committed to ensuring an inclusive campus that welcomes students of all backgrounds.”
MLSA’s letter follows a series of student activism against racist conduct from faculty members at GULC. The GULC administration placed Ilya Shapiro, a prospective administrator, on administrative leave Jan. 31 pending investigation from the Law Center following racist and sexist tweets about President Biden’s pledge to nominate the first Black female Supreme Court justice. The decision followed a Jan. 28 statement released by the Georgetown Law Black Law Student Association (Georgetown BLSA), urging GULC to to rescind Shapiro’s job offer, commit to a more thorough hiring process, properly staff the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, ensure the representation of Black students when it comes to hiring decisions and fund an endowment to support Black GULC students. 
Professor Franz Werro referred to a student Feb. 10 using an anti-Asian slur, prompting the GULC Asian Pacific American Law Students Association (APALSA) and the Georgetown China Law Society (GCLS) to urge the GULC to hold mandatory implicit bias training for professors and to discipline staff and faculty. In March 2021, Black students and faculty at GULC demanded institutional change after a viral video captured professor Sandra Sellers making racist comments about Black students in her course.
In light of recent controversies at GULC, as well as Ross’ course and clinic, some members of MLSA ask that Islam be taught within accurate and objective contexts at GULC, according to Fayed.
“We want her course curriculums to be modified to be more sensitive to POC cultures and the Islamic faith through the use of a Muslim expert to review the curriculum,” Fayed wrote.
Haq said she ultimately decided to forfeit the opportunity to learn in a clinic she is interested in because of the racism she found in Ross’ curriculum. According to Haq, she is not the only Muslim student who was hesitant to participate in Ross’ course or clinic.  
Nearly 50% of Muslims living in the United States experienced some form of discrimination in the past year, including being treated with suspicion, called offensive names and singled out by law enforcement, according to 2017 data from the Pew Research Center. 
MLSA’s letter also demands that Ross’ grading systems change so that personal biases cannot influence student grades, according to Fayed.
“What we are asking for is simple: removing Prof. Ross from any student evaluation position where her biases and prejudices would negatively affect POC and Muslim students,” Fayed wrote. “The non-blinding grading system does not protect POC and Muslim students at all from Prof. Ross’s inherent prejudices and racism.”
Chehade said that the Islamophobic tactics Ross uses in her curriculum would result in further discrimination if left unchecked by the university.
“It really starts here in the classroom, when we continue to be silent about these blatant forms of racism, when we continue to be passive and say, ‘This is normal,’” Chehade said.

I happen to know Professor Ross and know she’s absolutely against bigotry & religious intolerance. When Trump was running for office and proposed the Muslim ban she was horrified. She’s against practices that subjugate & harm women. That’s her passion. Not hatred. The students go speak with her directly about what they see as bias, discuss how they see the issues, and both parties can try to better understand each other. It’s cruel to paint her in this light, as she’s spent her long career trying to better the lives of many people, Muslims included.

“Students leads charge against female professor (and director of the International Women’s Human Rights Clinic) for teaching women’s rights material” is  playing differently in the campus press than one would have imagined. 
Of course anyone who was offended by the way Professor Ross teaches her class should be heard. I hope this professor takes this feedback in good faith and reassesses whether she is presenting culturally sensitive material in a sophisticated way.
But of course, the men who run Georgetown should stand up for the right of an accomplished feminist professors to speak about women’s rights, and ignore this outrageous demand to submit her writings to the approval of religious authorities.
And, setting subjective experiences for the moment, the rest of this complaint is absurd. Any decent law student should be able to see through it.
The supposedly offensive exam questions? They’re all extremely normal legal case questions, in which students are challenged to explain how they would represent a particular client taking a particular stand on a women’s rights issue. Yes, some of these stands are controversial, like the French ban on wearing religious dress in classrooms. But don’t Georgetown Law students realize that, as aspiring lawyers, they may need to represent clients who hold controversial positions, even some they may not agree with? Don’t they understand that learning how to do that is … the point of law school? 
The answer, I think, is that they do understand, but they are trying to make mountains out of molehills to tar a professor who (understandably) rubbed them the wrong way by loudly and unapologetically standing up for women’s rights around the world. They’re entitled to their discomfort, but if they don’t recognize the regressive precedent they are trying to set, I hope Georgetown Law leadership does.

This sounds like a personal attack by Haq and Fayed. Do they really think anywhere in America that a university is going to submit a syllabus to a “Muslim expert” for review before teaching. I you think that is going to happen, then GULC or for than matter any American University is not for them. In addition to the separation of church and state there is a concept called academic freedom that allows professors to address issues that are of consequence, and that does includes religions. Religious wars have been the most heinous events in history, murdering people in untold numbers for some infraction against the belief. And its not just wars, it is the day to day religious oppression of those who choose not to comply or voice an opposition. If Haq and Fayed don’t think that is a subject they can intellectually discuss, then perhaps they either don’t have the intellectual capacity to engage in debate, or they are themselves such zealots demanding ‘their rights’ be accommodated they do not belong in the legal profession. GULC has a diversity of students wanting to become lawyers. If Haq and Fayed cannot articulate a position that shows where Ross is violating a law in her teachings, then perhaps they are not suited to the legal profession. I certainly wouldn’t want to find out a lawyer I’ve  hired to defend me would let religion or anything else stand the way of a full throated defense. 
This foolish complaint should be dismissed. And if the complainants are not satisfied, perhaps they should be as well.

No aspect of the comments in support of the professor make sense.  Here is an example of why. According to Donald Trump, those persons — especially Blacks who accused him of being a racist — were the real racists.  Those who supported him not only agreed, but also supported and defended Trump.  Who were these persons?  Many were white nationalists.
I believe the students.  First, Muslims in professional school tend to aspire to just fit in, integrate into their academic settings, and avoid virtually anything that would bring attention to them.  They usually quietly endure institutional insults and encourage other to do the same.  They endure harms. They don’t raise controversy.  Rarely will they respond with demands, sans instances when they seek to address a material harm. 
Second, the professor’s assignments are both unusual and unbalancing. A core principal of legal training is teach a student to, “argue both sides”.  This is not just the practice of law school, but also one of its mandates.  Related, for examination and papers, students are asked to weigh the merits of both side and reach a conclusion. These exercises can be fun because they stimulate debate and students’ knowledge of a subject matter. 
Never, not ever should a law professor instruct a student to argue against the religious or cultural practices of a people — especially if those persons are either Muslim or Jewish.  To do so is an abjectly racist practice.  For certain, the exercise itself is intended to cause harm.
The student’s response was moderated. They expressed their harm and, “proffered” an occasion for Susan Ross, and indeed GT Law, to make amends.  I especially applaud their efforts because, even after being harmed, they only sought that their law school fix things going forward.  
Georgetown U Law is now at a place where it can right a wrong.  It should suspend Ross from teaching.  It may seek to get her placed at a law school in Israel. There, her anti-Muslim speech and practices will be received without controversy.  Or they can encourage her affiliated research and advocacy organisations to fire her.
The law should also undergo changes in its hiring practices.  It should encourage younger Muslim lawyers to teach at the school.  This may lead to the law school fixing the racist biases threat seem to have overwhelmed its Muslim (and, likely other) student populations.  It may also result in GT law benefitting. At a minimum, its students would learn how to argue both sides.
Having evidence of Ross’ decade long patterns of harming and speaking against the cultural and religious practices of Muslims, Georgetown need only do the right thing this time around.   Have her to step down from ever teaching students again.

Ross is a bigot in many ways.  I took her clinic in 1995 before she published her book and she took her stress out on us … esp. me.  The year before she took a year to grade a paper and look up every single footnote.  I am disabled and have an invisible disability and she told me I was “faking it.”  She even shoved me in court .. I should have had her arrested.  She never finished my recommendations, then denied my entrance to a fellowship.  Ross uses feminism to advance herself only and cares nothing about individual women or students.  She’s a terror and a nightmare and it’s a shame her reign is allowed to continue.  She is, quite simply, a terrible human being.

My post was removed.  I had Deller Ross in two classes in 94 and 95 – both were still horror stories engrained on my mind, even now.  I wrote a beautiful long paper on immigration guidelines in the US based on gender persecution and Ross tried to tear it apart – after waiting to grade it for almost a year – and her incomplete – due to her inability to grade – cost me a job offer.  Then in her clinic, she drug me all year asking me to do all kinds of extra work because I was disabled – holding my grade over my head to blackmail me to do it.  She even shoved me in court, and told me my disability was something that I was “faking.”  I should have had her arrested for assault AND filed a complaint for gender/disability bias.  Don’t be fooled by her.  She uses feminism to advance her own career while she rapes the minds and spirits of students who are different than she is – and fawns over a few select favorites.  She falls back on the notion that she is “tenured.”  I am not muslim and I would characterize her as a bigot against the disabled as well as in general an intolerant person.  She is a self-aggrandizer and creates a lot of harm in her ability to broadcast her name in the supposed “help” she has done for other women.  I would guess she has done more harm than good.  I congratulate the student above for having the nerve to speak out.  Ross is a nightmare and I am sorry to hear her reign of terror continues.  She absolutely destroyed my time at Georgetown, never got my recommendations out – and then denied me a fellowship. I have gone on to practice and was even a judge, but still carry her scars.

Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) hosted their annual Israeli Apartheid Week to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine and raise awareness about the human rights abuses they face.
The event, which was held from March 14 to 18, featured events regarding advocacy for the people of Palestine, beginning with an Apartheid Week launch in Red Square. Other events included a tile painting event and a panel discussion on March 17. There was also a Palestine Gala on March 18, which featured music, food, art, dabka — a Palestinian dance style — and other performances.  
Israel has systematically discriminated against Palestinians who live under Israel’s rule in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), according to a report by human rights group Amnesty International. Israel has also forcibly displaced Palestinians through coercive measures, including home demolitions. 
Georgetown SJP planned Apartheid Week in partnership with the Georgetown Muslim Students Association (MSA), Stand with Kashmir, Gender Justice Initiative (GJI), Black Student Alliance, Black Graduate Student Alliance and Alliance of Graduate Employees. 
Last month, Amnesty International named Israel an apartheid state due to its treatment of Palestinians. Apartheid is a crime against humanity under international law. In the report, Amnesty said Israel has enacted laws that create a system of control over Palestinians.  
SJP planned Apartheid Week to increase awareness about the Palestinian freedom struggle, according to an anonymous member of MSA and SJP, who requested their name be withheld due to safety concerns.  
“We’re just hoping to change the views that people have and get more people educated about what’s really going on over there,” the MSA and SJP member told The Hoya. 
Georgetown SJP operates under Students for Justice in Palestine, a worldwide network of college activism organizations. 
GJI Director Melyssa Haffaf said that GJI chose to partner with SJP to host the event to raise awareness about what is happening in Palestine.  
“We believe it was a great educational forum for those who are not necessarily familiar with the history of this ongoing struggle and bring visibility to other movements striving for advancing justice and equity,” Haffaf wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
A SJP representative, who asked to remain anonymous due to fear of the risks of public Palestinian advocacy, said the involvement of many student clubs in the week of events signals a shift in perspectives on the issue. 
“So many organizations showed support, and that would have been unimaginable a few years ago — it really shows growth in this movement and the way that people are looking at Palestine as a smaller part of a bigger, interconnected problem that we need to solve,” the SJP representative said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Khury Petersen-Smith, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and an expert on the Middle East, spoke at the Apartheid Week panel. 
He and other panelists framed the issue in an innovative way, Petersen-Smith said. 
“In the panel, we worked to lay out why we understand this as a struggle for justice not only in terms of justice for Palestinians, but in the context of various struggles around the world,” Petersen-Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Petersen-Smith’s panel, titled “Interconnected Liberation,” focused on the links between Palestinian liberation struggles and justice and liberation struggles in the United States and elsewhere. 
Idun Hauge (GRD ’24), decided to join SJP last week after hearing about Apartheid Week from a friend on the SJP board. 
“There’s very little awareness in the U.S. about crimes against Palestinians, the really kind of horrible conditions that people live under,” Hauge said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Last week Georgetown SJP circulated posters promoting the week of events around campus, according to the MSA and SJP member, which were subsequently removed from Red Square by unknown individuals. 
“That was definitely the most unsettling thing that happened in our week, having our advertising and pretty much our freedom of speech restricted by certain students on campus,” the MSA and SJP member said.
Georgetown is committed to free and open inquiry on campus through verbal and nonverbal expression. Some areas on campus, including Red Square, are considered “public squares,” spaces available for student expression without registration requirements. 
After the investigation of the Georgetown University Police Department into the ripping down of posters, SJP was able to identify one student who ripped down posters, but the organization chose not to disclose their identity to The Hoya. 
On March 15, Interim Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Jeanne F. Lord sent an email to all students reemphasizing university free speech policy.
“On our Hilltop campus, Red Square is uniquely located as a public forum expressly designed for the impromptu and ongoing expression of ideas and viewpoints by members of our campus community,” the email reads. 
Georgetown Israel Alliance (GIA) President Daniel Rogov (COL ’23) said he and GIA condemn the removal of SJP’s posters.
“As Georgetown students, it is essential that we support and actively defend each other’s right to free speech,” Rogov wrote to The Hoya. 
Still, GIA stands against the actual messaging of Apartheid Week, according to Rogov.
“Classifying Israel as an apartheid state is not only incorrect, but dangerously misinformed,” Rogov wrote. “This misinformation is counterproductive to promoting genuine reforms in Israel, and has the potential to harm Israeli citizens of all religions and ethnicities in undermining the nation’s legitimacy.”
The MSA and SJP member said the event was a success due to high student engagement.
“We definitely did have a few people who passed by who clearly expressed some disagreement, some people secretly recording us, but for the most part it was positive responses,” the MSA and SJP member said. 
UPDATE: This article was updated March 30 to retract the identity of the source now referred to as the “MSA and SJP member.” The source requested anonymity on March 29 due to the fear of safety risks surrounding public Palestinian advocacy.

Rabbi Rachel Gartner is stepping down after serving as Director of Jewish Life at Georgetown for 11 years, a role in which she was cherished by students, community members and the campus ministry team.
Gartner will begin her new position as the rabbi of congregation Shirat HaNefesh in Chevy Chase, Md., at the end of the spring 2022 semester. She will simultaneously serve as the Senior Advisor for Spiritual Care at Georgetown’s School of Continuing Studies.
Gartner said she has cherished her time working with students and will miss spending time getting to know them.
“The thing I’m going to miss the most is working with students and just being in it with them, being in their lives, being in the classroom, enjoying their humor, relishing their wit and their intelligence,” Gartner told The Hoya. “I adore laughing with the students, I adore community building with the students and I adore accompanying students through everything that it means to be an emerging adult.”
Father Mark Bosco, vice president for mission and ministry, informed Georgetown students of Gartner’s changing positions in an April 5 email. Gartner sent a more detailed email to students in Jewish Life, the group within Georgetown’s Campus Ministry that fosters a Jewish community on campus, later that day. 
Gartner said that she is pursuing her new role as the rabbi of congregation Shirat HaNefesh because she feels a calling, but will miss the students and community at Georgetown immensely. 
“It’s not bigger, it’s not better, it’s just different. It’s just there’s a time for change in life, and that’s the time it is for me,” Gartner said. “So that’s really how I feel about this. I’m being very called into some new angles on the rabbinate.” 
While serving as director, Gartner energized Jewish Life by hosting her monthly “Makóm Midrash” bagel brunch series and initiating the GUish community organizing internship and Bayit living-learning community designed to celebrate and engage in Jewish culture. 
Alex Cywes (SFS ’23), a Jewish Life intern, met Gartner his first week on campus and said she consistently ensured that Jewish Life at Georgetown was inclusive and open to people from all backgrounds, which he hopes her successor will continue.
“That was something that I was really proud of and was one reason why I wanted to be a Jewish intern coming from not the most intense Jewish background,” Cywes said. “I really hope they’re able to replicate that because there are a lot of fracture lines along what it means to be Jewish, whether it’s questions of Israel or questions of spiritual practice, and Rabbi did an amazing job of making sure that everyone had a place in the Jewish community at Georgetown.”
The university is currently working to ensure that there is a smooth transition of leadership within Jewish Life, according to a university spokesperson. 
“The Office of Mission and Ministry is working to arrange interim leadership for Jewish Life while it prepares to undertake a formal search process for Rabbi Gartner’s successor,” the spokesperson wrote. “This search will include input and participation from the Georgetown Community, including faculty, staff and students. The Office will share updates when they are available.”
Rev. Ebony Grisom, Interim Director of Protestant Christian Ministry at Georgetown, said Gartner exemplifies faith in action. 
“I’ve appreciated the way that Rabbi articulates her sense of justice as one rooted in her faith,” Grisom wrote to The Hoya. “She models for students and colleagues a way to integrate one’s faith commitments into daily life. She embodies a faith that does justice, and how contemplation can lead to action.”
Chloe Schneider (COL ’24), Social Justice Chair of the Jewish Student Association (JSA) board and president of the Campus Ministry student forum, has known Gartner since her being a first-year and found her to be someone who was easy to build a connection with from the beginning.
“She’s definitely been a big part of my Georgetown experience — I probably see her at least once a week,” Schneider said in an interview with The Hoya. “She’s so personal, and you really don’t feel that staff barrier that you feel with a lot of people at Georgetown.”
Schneider also took one of Gartner’s courses, titled “Death, Sex and Tattoos: Jewish Perspectives on Taboo Subjects,” which had students look at real world issues through a rabbinical lens.
“It was my favorite class I’ve taken at Georgetown — it was so interesting,” Schneider said. “What I took away from that class is that Judaism addresses people, not problems.”
Hannah Kosc (SFS ’23), Jewish Life intern and JSA co-president, said that Gartner played a role in her decision to commit to Georgetown after initially meeting her during her senior year of high school at the GAAP admitted students weekend. 
[Kosc previously served on The Hoya’s Editorial Board.]
Kosc said Gartner has been a major part of her support system on campus and will be missed by many students.
“Rabbi has always just been like a Georgetown mom,” Kosc told The Hoya. “I know a lot of people in Jewish life feel that way about Rabbi. She’s a very loving person, and before her professional identity comes that love, and I think that’s really special. We’re all going to miss her a lot.”
Gartner said that she looks forward to serving the larger Jewish community in her new role.  
“I feel very called to serve Jewish communities at this moment in time,” Gartner said. “I’m really excited about just being in a very vibrant Jewish community at this moment in history and focusing in a depthfull way in Jewish life in the broader community.”

The School of Foreign Service (SFS) awarded the annual J. Raymond “Jit” Trainor Award to William J. Burns, a former U.S. ambassador and the current director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in a Feb. 2 ceremony. 
The Trainor Award, named after a former SFS registrar, is handed out on a yearly basis to an exemplar of excellent conduct in diplomacy. Burns won the award in 2022, but he could not attend a ceremony in-person until now because of ongoing commitments with the federal response to the war in Ukraine. 
Burns served as a diplomat for 33 years before retiring in 2014. Throughout his career in diplomacy, Burns served as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs during the September 11 terrorist attacks, Senior Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs at the National Security Council, U.S. Ambassador to Russia, U.S. Ambassador to Jordan and Deputy Secretary of State. 
After receiving the award, Burns offered remarks responding to global threats and engaged in a conversation with Ambassador Barbara K. Bodine, a professor in the practice of diplomacy and director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, a Georgetown University center dedicated to exploring diplomacy and global issues..
Burns said encouragement from his father and his father’s service in the military first sparked Burns’ decision to enter a career in diplomacy.
“Public service has shaped my whole life. When I was a graduate student many years ago, trying to figure out what to do with my life, I got a letter that proved to inspire me,” Burns said at the event. “It was from my father, a remarkable career army officer and a fine man who died recently. ‘Nothing will make you prouder,’ my dad wrote, ‘than to serve your country with honor.’”
Burns said this advice served as his inspiration over his decades-long career in foreign service in countries across the globe. 
Looking to the future, Iran should be a central focus for American policymakers approaching the often-murky relationship between the United States and the Middle East, according to Burns.
“The Middle East has emerged as a particularly complicated set of challenges for American policymakers as well,” Burns said, “Part of that is about the Iranian regime that I think is increasingly unsettled about what’s going on inside Iran.”
Burns said that instability in Iran can be attributed to protests in the country speaking out against the current regime.
“The remarkable courage of demonstrators over the last few months, especially young Iranian women, who in many respects are fed up with economic decay, corruption, political oppression and social restrictions, I think that unsettled view of what is going on internally is leading to more aggressive behavior externally toward the Iranian regime,” Burns said.
After the September 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman who died while in police detention, protests swept Iran with demands for increased freedom in the country. While similar protests occurred in Iran in 2009, 2017 and 2019, the ongoing movement is the most widespread in recent memory.
Burns said addressing ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, including conflict in the Israel-Palestine region, will be an engaging task to take on in his work as CIA director.
Recent developments in the region, including a shift to the right in Israeli elections and clashes between Israelis and Palestinians, have sparked fears that conflict could spiral. In a recent visit to Jerusalem, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged both sides to remain calm and begin to work toward restabilization.
“We see it across the Middle East,” Burns said. “Part of the responsibility of my agency is to work as closely as we can with Palestinian security services and Israeli security services to prevent the kind of exposure to violence that we have seen in recent weeks as well. That is going to be a good challenge.”
Burns said his personal experiences in public service have prepared him for his current position leading a national intelligence agency.
“Today, I am still in the arena, very proud to have been a career diplomat and equally proud now to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, leading another incredibly dedicated group of women and men at a moment of profound transformation on the international landscape,” Burns said.

The Georgetown University Master of Science in Foreign Service program hosted former U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker on Feb. 22 for a discussion on a career in diplomacy and current events in global affairs.
The event was moderated by Paul Miller, a School of Foreign Service professor of the practice of international affairs. Crocker, a decorated career foreign service officer who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009, discussed his experience as U.S. ambassador to six Middle Eastern countries under former U.S. Presidents George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
Crocker served as U.S. ambassador to Lebanon from 1990 to 1993; ambassador to Kuwait from 1994 to 1997; ambassador to Syria from 1999 to 2001; ambassador to Pakistan from 2004 to 2007; ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009; and ambassador to Afghanistan from 2011 to 2012. 
Crocker spent his childhood traveling around the world as the son of a career officer of the U.S. Air Force. Crocker’s experiences visiting the Middle East inspired him to join the foreign service in 1972.
“I had the opportunity to visit Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, with my parents and just fell in love with it. Just something about it. It just grabbed me,” Crocker said. “Fascinating part of the world. I’ve gotta figure out a way to get back to it at some point.” 
Crocker served mainly in the Middle East after joining the foreign service — including as a staffer in Lebanon when jihadi militants set off a suicide car bomb outside the U.S. embassy in 1983, killing 63 — and said he adapted quickly to these wartime environments.
“Danger, per se, was never that big of an issue for me,” Crocker said. “You do responsible things, of course, not to get gratuitously killed. Creates a lot of paperwork, but beyond that, I discovered I actually liked it.”
“Time would seem to slow down. Things would become much clearer than they would without the artillery in the background,” Crocker added. “Either you have that gene or you don’t, and I guess I had it.”
Crocker said life as a foreign service officer has changed substantially since he joined, with families of officers often now unable to join them in posts abroad. 
“Back in the olden days, an individual joined the foreign service who could have a reasonable expectation that she or he would travel to interesting places with family, the kids would have a wonderful educational experience studying in international schools and so forth,” Crocker said at the event. “That foreign service has changed a lot.”
Crocker said a knowledge of regional history and the perception of that history by locals is crucial for any aspiring foreign service officer to understand the countries in which they serve. 
“I didn’t really know much history. Most of us don’t in America. We’re not about yesterday, and we’re about today and tomorrow. That’s how we build our country,” Crocker said. 
Although the United States has typically been active politically and militarily in the Middle East and Central Asia, recent years have seen U.S. presidents take a more passive role in Middle Eastern and Central Asian affairs — culminating in President Joe Biden’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.
“I would say that acceptance and assertion of a global leadership role by the United States has now been increasingly called into question, not so much by potential international rivals, but by our own population and our own leaders,” Crocker said.
As a veteran diplomat and expert on Middle East affairs, Crocker said U.S. leaders need to readopt a more active policy toward the region. 
“My view of the Middle East and where it was and where it’s going has a lot to do with, frankly, what we decide to do as Americans, whether we are still ready and able to play the principal external role in the Middle East, which is what we have done since the end of World War II,” Crocker said.
Crocker said Biden’s foreign policy choices regarding the war in Ukraine set an example for strategies that the United States should be pursuing in the Middle East. 
“He’s pretty much got it as right as you could ever hope,” Crocker said. “Hours and hours and hours spent with the European Union, with NATO, with others, doing whatever it took to send the signal that the U.S. is, in fact, back. We are ready and able to stand up for global peace of security, and we can still rally a very strong alliance to support us in this.”
Crocker said there is a long-term need for U.S. leaders to exercise careful judgment in every decision in an age of foreign policy insecurity.
“Your major actions, whether to intervene or to disengage, carry with them not just third and fourth order consequences, but 40th and 50th order consequences that you cannot maybe even imagine,” Crocker said.

Members of the Georgetown, Divest! coalition brought their case to the Georgetown University Student Association Senate meeting Sunday night, spurring discussion about potential changes to the university’s investment process.
Five members of Georgetown, Divest! met with Georgetown administrators on April 9, but were unable to make headway with the university.
The coalition lectured on what it called a dearth of transparency in current university investment protocol that inhibits student access to information in the Investment Office.
Jackson Perry (COL ’12), vice president of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), told the senate that Georgetown did not engage in “socially responsible investing.” This was due, he said, to the Georgetown University Investment Office’s policy to not make public the details of its investment decisions.
Perry showed the council a screen photo of the Investment Office Web site from April 9, 2010, which displayed a paragraph stating that a Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility would “[review] all shareholder proposals on social responsibility” with the shareholders including the students at Georgetown University, according to Perry.
Perry claimed that when meeting with university administrators, “They claimed that the information on the Web site was out of date, even though it was only put up a year ago.”
He then showed another screen photo, from April 12, which showed the same passage mentioned had been deleted.
Citing a speech delivered by University President John J. DeGioia on Feb. 4, 2007, Perry said the perceived shortfalls in communication violated Georgetown policy.
Three years ago, DeGioia said, “Our heritage requires that social justice issues are never consigned to the shadows of our consciousness.”
GUSA President Calen Angert (MSB ’11) asked how many companies the coalition was examining.
Angert also asked about the feasibility of the project, saying, “These are huge funds that we’re invested in, and I doubt that all of our endowment [$1 billion] is invested in just one of them.”
SJP President Elise Garofalo (COL ’12) added that even without the approval of the Investment Office, students could write letters to the managers of the funds voicing their concern.
Senator Nick Troiano (COL ’11) was more defensive of the Investment Office.
“There are trade secrets and other rules and regulations that prevent information from being divulged,” Troiano said.
Troiano also questioned the ability of the university to reform the system, saying, “At the end of the day, you want the university to be able to say to the [investment] companies that they don’t want to invest in those companies. How do you get to that point?”
Perry responded, “Student involvement should be encouraged. As long as there is sufficient evidence, there should be a process to protest. There needs to be a way to make sure [the investment companies and the Investment Office] are telling the truth.”
Ultimately, Perry said, “We’re envisioning a resolution calling on the university to establish a process on how it does socially responsible justice. The mechanism by which students can voice concerns about the investments would be very important.”
Senator Clara Gustafson (SFS ’13) expressed her view that GUSA should become the overseer of complaints about socially responsible investments, saying, “Any student concerns [about investments] should be brought to GUSA, a resolution drafted and then a vote held.”
Troiano discussed the possibility of a resolution at the meeting the following week.
“We should support effort[s] for the mechanism to protest, but I am not so enthused that we try to force the university to say yes or no on specific companies or countries as investment choices,” Troiano said.
In other matters, Senator Colton Malkerson (COL ’13) reported that the Performing Arts Advisory Council signed an agreement with GUSA, vowing to open the election of PAAC leaders to member organizations. Now, the groups comprising PAAC will be able to veto applicants, as long as a simple majority votes against them.

From advocating for wage increases for the Department of Public Safety officers to protesting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, this year has been marked by a surge of student activism on campus, with many choosing to hold public rallies or demonstrations to draw attention to their causes.
According to James Reardon-Anderson, senior associate dean and director of undergraduate programs in the School of Foreign Service, peaceful protest and the ensuing dialogue is a large part of being a student at a university.
“When students care enough to get active about something, generally speaking, it’s a good sign. Sometimes it gets a little bit excessive, but that is just the way people are. This is a democracy and you have to allow for a certain amount of give and take,” Reardon-Anderson said.
One particularly highly public demonstration was the protest organized by Plan A: Students for Reproductive Justice during one of the Georgetown Admissions Ambassador Program Open House Weekend in March. Supporters chained themselves to the statue of John Carroll in Healy Circle, shouted chants and passed out fliers to current members of the Georgetown community as well as many prospective students. While some prospective families said they did not support the protest, many said they viewed it as a sign that Georgetown students are active on campus.
“It gives a perspective to a potential student as to how their voices will be heard, given that there is an opportunity to protest. It feels good that groups are comfortable expressing themselves to the administration,” prospective parent Lesli Adams of Anaheim, Calif., said to THE HOYA on March 27.
Bryan Woll (COL ’12), president of Georgetown University College Democrats, agreed. He said that the expression of a diversity of opinions is integral to a democratic society and an academic community.
“There seems to be the general aversion to all things [similar to] public disturbance, things not common place, people making their voices heard in a loud way. The fact that people are uncomfortable about that is something we should get beyond,” Woll said.
The student activism may indicate that Georgetown students, in particular, have a heightened awareness of issues within the community.
“Georgetown students have a very strong sense of social responsibility. That’s part of what we work to imbed in our students. That is something we find to be a very attractive quality,” Scott Fleming, associate vice president for federal relations, said.
But there are many who believe that there is a careful line between productive discussion and disrespect. According to Reardon-Anderson, protest goes too far if there is ever violence or the threat of violence. Others believe that activism takes an adverse form when it infringes on others’ right to free speech.
“Students are not only allowed to express their views but also encouraged to do so,” Will Downes (COL ’11) said. “As a general rule, you have the right of freedom of expression and protest, but not at the expense of others’ right to free speech.”
Those who protested at Gen. David Petraeus’ address in Gaston Hall on Jan. 21 were criticized along these lines by many members of the Georgetown community.
A groups of students, led by Jon Askonas (SFS ’13), organized to form Students for Respectful Dialogue and co-hosted a counterprotest in reaction to the anti-war protests.
“Our issue wasn’t with their message. Our message to them was, You are hurting yourself if you are attacking someone else’s free speech to promote your own,” Askonas said. “It makes yourself look bad.”
Chessa Gross (SFS ’10), a participant in the counterprotest, ultimately deemed the demonstration
successful because they were able to effectively convey their message.
“I think the issue with the negative reaction to the Petraeus protests was the assumption that this speech was intended to be dialogue. Petraeus’ `strategic engagement’ speech to promote the U.S. occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan was not planned as a dialogue,” Gross said. “This was planned as a propaganda event with canned responses to audience questions – by no means is that a `dialogue.'”
any of the protests this year, including the call for a wage raise for DPS officers to improve student safety and Georgetown Divest!, a coalition seeking to persuade the university to divest from companies that violate human rights in Israel and Palestine, demanded response and action from the university administration.
“The university supports the right of everyone in our community to make their views known in a dignified manner,” Director of Media Relations Andy Pino said. “To that end, we offer numerous avenues where our students and members of our faculty and staff can provide insight and input on decisions that affect nearly every aspect of university life.”
In that sense, many of the campaigns have been successful. Plan A was granted a meeting with administrators and continues to engage in productive discussion with the university. And while a compromise has not been reached, LaMarr Billups, assistant vice president for business policy planning, has responded to the concerns of the Divest! coalition.
“To a certain degree, a campus has to tolerate some space there,” Reardon-Anderson said. “[A university] can certainly impose its rules and so forth, but it doesn’t want to be too draconian,” he said.
The push for a DPS wage raise also had real, tangible results. According to Gross, a member of Georgetown Solidarity Committee, new officers were being paid about $15 per hour – lower than any other university safety officer in the District, who largely receive about $18 or $19 per hour. When their contract came up for negotiation, the university offered them a raise of 40 cents.
“They came to us because they were in a bind,” Gross said. “They were under a university gag order against publicly advocating for themselves. In the end, it was students and officers fighting together that made a wage raise possible.”
After writing to the administration, hosting a rally on campus, and engaging in a silent protest during negotiations, the supporters were able to publicize their opinions. In the end, the officers were ultimately granted a raise of $2.50.
While the lasting impact of these campaigns and the future of this trend of student activism is uncertain, the demonstrations have captured the attention of the Georgetown community, fulfilling the ultimate goal of the student participants.
“I am actually attracted to protest,” Reardon-Anderson said, “just to see what students think about and are concerned about.”

The administration dealt a blow to Georgetown, Divest!, a coalition of students on campus that wants the university to divest from companies that may profit from human rights abuses in Israel and Palestine, on Tuesday.
Assistant Vice President for Business Policy and Planning LaMarr Billups wrote a letter to Georgetown, Divest! stating that the administration would not modify its investment practices.
Referencing the coalition’s April 9 meeting with a senior team of administrators, Billups wrote, “At that meeting you asked if Georgetown University would divest from managed funds that own stocks in certain companies that do business with Israel. The answer to that question is no.”
The question of divestment is a difficult one, since the university does not invest directly in companies, but rather in managed funds. The Investment Office does not make its investments public.
“Georgetown’s investment practices do not include the selection of individual securities,” Director of Media Relations Andy Pino said. “As a result, the question of divestment does not apply.”
Still, Georgetown, Divest! member and Vice President of Students for Justice in Palestine Jackson Perry (COL ’12) said he knows Georgetown, Divest!’s struggles are not for nothing.
“First of all, [Chief Investment Officer Larry Kochard] told us that he believed we were invested in Caterpillar,” Perry said. Caterpillar is one of the companies that Georgetown, Divest! has asked the university to divest from.
Perry added, “Condoms and cohabitation are not permitted on campus because they are not in keeping with the Jesuit values of the institution, yet the administration thinks our Jesuit values shouldn’t play a role in investment decisions at all? This is hypocrisy.”
Other schools around the country are also pushing university administrations to divest.
According to a press release from the chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine at University of California, Berkeley, students have been working to pass a bill through the UC Berkeley Student Senate on divestment since March.
On Wednesday, the UC Berkeley Student Senate met to vote on a bill that would urge the university to divest from two companies that profit from the manufacture of weapons for the Israeli Army. The student senate failed to override the veto on the bill, falling short by just one vote.
Other American universities that have called for divestment include the University of Michigan Dearborn, Hampshire College and the University of Wisconsin.
“Changing the status quo is one of the hardest things for anyone to do,” Perry said. “However, we are optimistic that the right amount of pressure from various directions, including especially the constant reminder of the moral values of our university itself, will break through the bureaucratic inertia and amoral mindset that is currently dominating the way the university has responded.”
**Correction:** This article stated that the GUSA Senate met to vote on a bill that would urge the university to divest from two companies. The UC Berkeley Student Senate met to vote on such a bill.

With recently revived Israeli-Palestinian peace talks at risk of languishing due to ongoing Jewish settlement building in the West Bank, student groups at Georgetown have joined the contentious debate, calling for strong ties between the United States and Israel.
In a document released this fall, the Georgetown-Israel Alliance, College Democrats and College Republicans affirmed their agreement on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict despite their varying political affiliations.
“The statement covers three broad topics: recognition of Israel, support for a two-state solution, and opposition to Iran’s nuclear program,” Sam Blank (COL ’12), vice president of Political Affairs of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, said.
The document addresses issues that have been a source of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians since the establishment of Israel as a Jewish State in 1948, and advocates for a two-state solution under which “a democratic, viable Palestinian state dedicated to living in peace and security side by side with the Jewish state of Israel, mutual respect and diplomatic relations between the two states, and protection of and respect for human rights of all peoples,” exists.
Despite the bipartisan nature of the document which was drafted last spring, not all campus groups are pleased with the statement.
“Any statement on the conflict that doesn’t address at all the crucial points of the status of Jerusalem, the settlements, or Palestinian refugees does not merit praise or attention,” said Jackson Perry (COL’ 12), treasurer of Students for Justice in Palestine, a student advocacy group that educates about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“They are vaguely restating boilerplate U.S. foreign policy,” Perry added. “Nothing more.”
The Georgetown Israel Alliance is a student-run organization that handles both political and cultural issues relating to Israel. As the only pro-Israel group on campus, the organization views its mission as two-fold – for education and advocacy.
“We seek to educate the Georgetown community on Israel’s culture and society, as well as promote dialogue and discussion on the various dimensions of the Middle East conflict,” Blank said. “We advocate for the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish, democratic state that grants human and civil rights to all her citizens, regardless of race, class, religion or upbringing.”
Blank said that the GIA, like Israel itself, has a diverse range of political opinions among its constituency.
“We have members who are right, left and center, as well as Jewish and non-Jewish. Our members hold a wide range of views on the conflict and how best to solve it,” Blank said. “However, we all equally yearn to see the day when Israelis and Palestinians can live together in peace and security.”
College Democrats President Bryan Woll (COL ’12) and Communications Director William Vogt (SFS ’12) issued a statement to THE HOYA regarding their organization’s involvement in the collaboration.
“Our membership represents the diverse body of opinions that makes up Georgetown’s community,” Woll and Vogt said in the statement.
“Our leadership had the privilege to work with GIA last semester on this statement, which reflects the sentiment of most of our members, but certainly not all of them. We pride ourselves in having and embracing a diversity of opinions within our organization, and this issue is no different.”
Kevin Preskenis (COL ’12), chief of staff for the College Republicans, was extensively involved in the preparation of this statement. He said that he looks forward to working with the GIA on what he believes to be a significant foreign policy issue.
“By signing on to the Georgetown Israel Alliance’s joint statement, we are expressing our broader foreign policy position on Israel, namely, its right to exist as a democratic, Jewish state, and our support of a strong alliance with the United States,” Preskenis said. “We also are hopeful of a two-state solution, in which the Palestinian authority recognizes Israel’s right to exist peacefully, which is a proposal the GIA statement addresses.”

Campus discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may be stuck in the past, according to experts who visited Georgetown this week to transform talk of Middle East issues into a cooperative effort.
In Copley Formal Lounge, Middle East policy analysts Ghaith al-Omari, a Georgetown graduate, and David Makovsky presented their views about a cooperative two-state solution to Israeli-Palestinian woes, as part of “The Dialogue Initiative,” sponsored by the International Relations Club and the Georgetown Israel Alliance and nationally by the Israel on Campus Coalition.
According to both al-Omari and Makovsky, campus discussions across the country about the conflict are rooted too far in the past, not keeping pace with progress in the Middle East.
“The campus discourse, we thought, was too much about recriminations,” Makovsky said. “Usually the campuses are ahead of the curve on issues, but on this one issue across the country, we felt the campuses are behind the curve. While people are talking to each other in the Middle East, why can’t they talk to each other in the Northeast?”
Rather than forming factions, students should recognize that the interests of Israel and Palestine are not diametrically opposed, al-Omari said.
“You can be a pro-Palestine advocate without being anti-Israel,” he said.
He illustrated the way in which campus dialogue seems focused on the “zero-sum approach,” which states that what is good for one nation is bad for the other and the “tribal approach,” which delves into the history of both nations to justify conflict. Neither of these viewpoints, he argued, leaves room for objectivity or potential consensus.
“It’s very easy to point out the bad side of the other,” al-Omari said. “It is easy to get angry.”
He noted that as far back as the mid-1990s, both sides expressed willingness to settle for a two-state solution, even if media coverage has tended to highlight areas of conflict.
“The loudest voices that we hear are the extreme voices on both sides,” al-Omari explained. “Those who want to get along, get along quietly.”
Centrist activists tend to remain quiet about their activities, Makovsky explained, in part because they do not want to upset or embarrass other members of their nation.
“The reality on the ground is far more complex than you read in the newspapers,” Makovsky said. “It is based on the two sides working together. [There is] a de facto alliance that neither side talks about.”
Shifting collegiate dialogue to a more centrist approach could eventually overpower extremists who now stand in the way of unity. This approach motivates al-Omari and Makovsky in their efforts to campaign across campuses.
“If we are serious people for a two-state solution, then we have to build up both sides of the two-state solution,” Makovsky said. “We found that the faculty was not attuned to these developments on the ground, that their thinking was stuck in a very confrontational age. What we want to do is bring the message to the students that you’ve got to be forces for coexistence.”
The end goal for students is to find a viable solution to the conflict, and students are keen on using dialogue now so that policy implementation can occur later on.
“For us, we hope to change the topics of the dialogue,” Daphna Katz (COL ’12), co-president of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, said. “We are students on college campuses, so we aren’t going to be establishing peace in the Middle East here. What we can do is not go back to 1948, but have dialogue about how we can move forward.”

Combining comedy with social commentary, award-winning Arab-American comedian Dean Obeidallah spoke Friday about his mission to counter stereotypes with humor Friday.
“In America, we have a great tradition of using comedy to raise social and political issues,” he said.
Half-Palestinian, half-Sicilian and New Jersey-raised, Obeidallah has an unconventional background. He said that the Sept. 11 attacks gave him a new perspective on his own upbringing and how it relates to the world around him.
“My life changed with 9/11,” Obeidallah said. “I was a white guy before 9/11, and after, I was an Arab.”
Along with this revelation came a new take on comedy. Perceiving a growth of “Islamophobia,” or anti-Muslim sentiment, Obeidallah said he uses his shows to try to promote understanding.
“I don’t like calling it ‘Islamophobia’ — it sounds like a cute disease,” Obeidallah said. “It’s a hate movement. We have to go out and counter that hate.”
By touring the United States and the Middle East, Obeidallah said he has reached out to people of all cultural and ethnic backgrounds.
“I think what makes Dean stand out is how he takes away that veil of ignorance through a very humanizing approach,” said Cynthia Schneider, professor in the School of Foreign Service and moderator of the Q-and-A session.
Attendee Julia Tanaka (SFS ’15) said she appreciated Obeidallah’s unique take on social issues.
“Often, politicians are afraid to say what’s right because of the political capital at stake, and this is a fantastic way to truly address what needs to be addressed,” she said.
Benjamin Nickl, a graduate student pursuing his Ph.D. with the SFS and the McDonough School of Business, said Obeidallah’s talk related well to his budding dissertation on ethnic comedy.
“We have the same kind of conflict going on in Germany and all over the globe,” said Nickl.
Obeidallah has taken his brand of comedy to countries including Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon, Oman, Israel, Qatar and Dubai. After performing shows for audiences in these countries, he always conducted free comedy workshops to help local comics.
Though Obeidallah recognizes the importance of countering the anti-Muslim sentiment, he also finds it difficult to quantify his success.
“People always ask if I’m making a change, and I say ‘I don’t know,'” Obeidallah said. “But I would rather take a chance and try to change something than sit back and not try at all.”
“I think with Dean, you see the combination of creativity, intelligence and humor that goes with comedy,” Schneider said. “And you see why in some ways, comedy is uniquely positioned to take on issues of anti-Muslim sentiment. I think that’s the humanizing element.”
Obeidallah said he continues his work in hope that his comedic approach encourages people from all around the world to become increasingly tolerant and willing to learn about each other.
“Some people I met in my southern tours had never met a Muslim in their lives,” Obeidallah said. “Teaching you something without trivializing it — that’s the type of comedy I aspire to.”

Congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) spoke about human rights and the stability of Israeli democracy in Copley Formal Lounge Monday night.
Frank has represented Massachussetts’ fourth congressional district since 1980 and is the first openly gay member of Congress. His speech was the first event in Israel Week, which is sponsored by the College Democrats and J Street U Georgetown. The talk was also sponsored by the Georgetown Israel Alliance and GU Pride.
Frank underscored his support for a sustainable peace process for Israel and Palestine and the importance of a continued friendship between the United States and Israel.
“[From] every value that I have gone into politics to pursue and protect … out of any state in the Middle East, Israel comes closest to that.”
Frank also said he recognized the need for better treatment of Arab settlers and citizens within the Israeli state.
“It is entirely legitimate to say Israel has made mistakes, but the obstacle to peace right now is not Israel, it is Hamas,” he said.
Calling Israel the most open democracy in the Middle East, Frank pointed to the country’s support for women’s and gay rights. He said that Israel’s democratic success countered the notion that democracy is only sustainable in safe regions.
“Israel has spent its entire existence at war and is one of the most important democracies in the world,” he said.

Congressman Jared Polis (D-Colo.) discussed the current Arab-Israeli conflict and potential solutions to the problem Tuesday.
The event was sponsored by the Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown Israel Alliance, GU Pride and J Street U Georgetown. As a part of Israel Issues Week, the discussion was designed to increase awareness about the situation in the Middle East.
In his talk, Polis stressed the need for a peaceful two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. He proposed the restoration of Israel’s 1967 borders and a series of land swaps to formally establish boundaries between Israel and Palestine.
“The land is really one of the easy impediments,” Polis said.
According to the congressman, the more serious barriers are irresolvable claims to power within the region, because both Palestine and Israel feel entitled to the land.
Polis also discussed the need to continue providing American aid to Israel.
“This would be a very dangerous time to zero out foreign aid,” Polis said. “It’s the job of many of us Democrats in the room to hold the Republican’s feet to the fire on their sensibly pro-Israel policies when they talk about zeroing out foreign aid to Israel.”
He added that the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran, which would further disrupt the unstable forces in the area and threaten international security, is a primary concern for the United States and Israel.
The lecture was also an opportunity to raise awareness about Georgetown’s recently established chapter of J Street U, a national organization that seeks to increase understanding of Israeli issues and promote a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Jason Gerson (SFS ’14), chapter co-president, believes that support for this organization is particularly important for Georgetown.
“I think that particularly Georgetown has a very strong interest and investment in what happens in regions outside of our own, which include the Middle East,” he said. “[There is a general] consensus that concessions on both sides are needed and that a peaceful resolution in this conflict isimperative.”

Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dennis Ross spoke about the Arab Spring and its implications for the Middle East in an event sponsored by the Program for Jewish Civilization on Thursday.
Ross, who has served as an advisor to Presidents Bush, Clinton and Obama, joked about his bipartisan career.
“I spent a long time working with Arabs and Israelis; I figured I might as well work with Republicans and Democrats,” he said.
His lecture, titled “The Arab Awakening and Its Implications,” focused on the events in the Middle East, describing them as an ongoing awakening rather than a fleeting spring, and the future of Iran and Israeli-Palestinian relations.
“It may not have been easily predictable when this would take place, but it was predictable that if change came, Islamists were going to have all the advantages in the early going,” he said.
Ross explained that the environment created by rulers like Hosni Mubarak, former Egyptian politician and military leader, resulted in all organized resistance occurring in mosques, separate from the secular arena.
Ross also discussed steps that Israel and Palestine both must take in order to achieve peace, relating the conflict to events in the broader Arab world.
“Both on the Arab Awakening and the issue of peace, the circumstances are dramatically different than they have been, but there is always something to be done. And only when you decide there is nothing to be done do you make that a self-fulfilling prophecy,” he said.
Students who attended the lecture were pleased by Ross’s foreign policy expertise.
“I’m a total standard SFS nerd and I followed Ross before I came here, so I was very excited,” CharlyJaffe (SFS ’13) said.
Ross currently teaches a course entitled “Statecraft and Negotiation” in the International Affairs program.

After months of researching topics, writing briefs, establishing committees and determining logistics, the Georgetown International Relations Association held the 50th North American Invitational Model United Nations this weekend.
The three-day conference marks the culmination of more than 11 months of Georgetown students’ hard work.
“I never would’ve imagined the amount of work that goes into it,” Director of Media and TechnologyOmika Jikaria (SFS ’15), a former special writer for The Hoya said. “We’ve been planning since last March.”
Putting on a conference for thousands of students requires extensive preparation, organization and manpower. There is a 21-person secretariat and nearly 200 student volunteers that compromise the general staff.
“Before NAIMUN starts, we all have very distinct roles,” Jikaria said. “But during the conference, our roles really overlap.”
This year marks the 50thanniversary of the conference, which has been hosted annually by GIRA since 1963. The high school students gather in the Washington Hilton for the largest independent student-run conference of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.
“There are a lot of Model UN conferences out there, but there are a couple of things that separate NAIMUN,” Secretary-General of NAIMUN 50 Theresa Lou (SFS ’14) said, referencing Georgetown’s expertise in international affairs and location in Washington, D.C.
While GIRA is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the conference benefits from its relationship with Georgetown. NAIMUN is staffed entirely by Georgetown students — primarily International Relations Club members — and Georgetown professors have long given the event’s keynote address. Many of the Georgetown student staffers attended the conference in high school.
“At our fall interest meeting, I’d say over 80 percent of those in attendance raised their hands when we asked who had attended NAIMUN as a high schooler,” Executive Director Cody Cowan (SFS ’14) said.
Former delegates said staffing the conference is rewarding.
“As a delegate, I didn’t really think about how many people it took to run NAIMUN or that they were all full-time students,” Director General Luke Young (MSB ’15) said. “Being on the other side is almost more fun. When you’ve invested so many years into an activity like Model UN, you constantly look for ways to make it new.”
Many of the staffers have forgone classes this week, despite looming midterms, in order to ensure that everything is ready for the weekend.
“I’ve spent almost an entire year doing this, and I don’t think I’ve regretted a minute of it,” Cowan said. “Except maybe when the 18-wheeler pulled up to my townhouse with over 3,500 pounds of NAIMUN merchandise to unload.”
Secretariat members said NAIMUN is as relevant now as it was when it was founded 50 years ago.
“We live in an interconnected world whether we like it or not,” Lou said. “I feel like as a global citizen, we have a duty to know what is going on around us. In 20 years, we’re going to be the people who have to deal with the legality of drones, with Palestine, and incur all of the mess. Model UN might not be realistic, but because there is no actual constraint of reality, you can do anything in MUN, and that’s when the best ideas are formed.”
To celebrate its anniversary, NAIMUN is introducing new features to the conference, including the NAIMUN smartphone app, which is designed to streamline the conference and give students and moderators easy access to important information, such as the conference schedule. Students have also already begun using the new NAIMUN social network to connect with their peers both before and after the conference.
“Many students come in taking [NAIMUN] as a competition,” Jikaria said. “This is just a way for delegates to get to know each other before hand and keep in touch afterwards.”
Young agreed and said that Model UN builds important and useful skills that may not necessarily be honed in a university classroom.
“MUN is an opportunity for high schoolers to reach out of their box and become more confident speaking in a public setting,” he said. “When you have to leave the committee room and work with a group of total strangers to get a document passed by the body — it is one of the most interactive and multifaceted versions of debate you can take part in.”
Though Cowan did not participate in Model UN in high school, he appreciates the “NAIMUN love” espoused by the high school delegates.
“I lovewhen we get a tweet from a delegate saying, ‘I can’t wait!’ and they tag all the friends throughout the country they’ve met through NAIMUN that they’ve only known for four days,” he said. “NAIMUN is only going to make for better diplomats, businessmen and representatives in the Peace Corps. Learning to stand in front of a room of 300 people you’ve never met and argue something you may not even believe — it’s a whole ecosystem that I can’t even begin to comprehend.”
For many high school delegates, their experience at NAIMUN stirs interest in attending Georgetown later on.
“As a delegate my senior year, I fell in love with the conference,” Chief of Staff Tommy Larson (SFS ’13) said. “Seeing 200 good-looking, smart, talented, and engaged college students — I became completely addicted to that. I was so enamored of Georgetown — it just became my dream school and what I wanted to do.”
Larson said that staffers also influence the students about their university decisions.
“When I was in high school, it was almost like hero worship — Georgetown kids were complete gods,” he said. “Some kids really look up to us, and the majority just want to get to know us.”
Just as staffers influence high school students, students influence NAIMUN staffers.
“As you go through Georgetown, you become a little jaded, a little less idealistic,” Lou said. “This rejuvenates me to take on the next step. It’s a tiring process, but our dedication comes from this — whether we know it or not we seek some sort of inspiration from these kids.”

This week, students will take a break from studying to learn Greek dancing, play cricket and cook African food as part of iWeek, a celebration of international students’ cultures sponsored by the Office of International Programs, despite several funding hurdles this year.
Student groups, including the African Society of Georgetown, Students for Justice in Palestine, the Georgetown Cricket Club and Ballet Folklorico Mexicano de Georgetown, will hold events representing their interests and cultures.
OIP grants $150 to each student group that sponsors an event, and student groups must find alternative resources for supplementary funding.
“This year we had some difficulty getting funding for the organizations so that was definitely a struggle,” International Students Sector Program Assistant Katie Mangialardi (COL ’16) said.
Mangialardi also said that cultural groups participating iniWeek have encountered trouble generating adequate publicity for their events this week, as the main outlet is a single Facebook page.
“Getting the word out is always a big thing for us,” she said.
However, campus-wide emails have encouraged some students to attend iWeek events, which run from Monday to Friday. Events kicked off with a half-hour meditation Monday night sponsored by the Buddhist Meditation Sangha, which Veronica Tovia (MSB ’16) attended.
“I’m very interested in Buddhism lately and tried it recently with a yoga instructor in Mexico,” Tovia said. “I saw it in an email for iWeek and I decided to come.”
Mangialardi said that she is most excited for the language exchange partner coffee hour Tuesday, which will promote the Language Exchange Program, a service that matches individuals who wish to practice foreign languages.  She also highlighted an art show in the Intercultural Center Galleria, run by the Georgetown University Student Association senate Subcommittee on the Arts. This art show is one of the subcommittee’s first actions since its formation in November.
GUSA senator and Subcommittee on the Arts Chair Lizzy Oh (SFS ’15) said that iWeek provides an opportunity to foster appreciation for student artwork at Georgetown.
“When GUSA established the arts subcommittee in the first place, we really wanted to bring artwork to campus — because it seems to be trapped in Walsh — and make it visible through an arts display,” Oh said.
Oh also aligned the goals of the Subcommittee on the Arts with the purpose of iWeek.
“We felt like the international students should be more involved with GUSA, and this is GUSA’s way of trying to recognize how international Georgetown is. Art is existent in every person and the subcommittee wanted to help foster creative expression on campus.”
She said hopes that the art show will help emphasize the important presence that foreign students have on campus.
“Our school is known for being internationally focused, but we don’t really see that outside [of] the classroom,” Oh said. “iWeek can really bridge the gaps between those who are international and those who are not international.”

To increase dialogue about the Arab-Israeli conflict, a group of Georgetown students revived J Street U, a pro-Israel, pro-peace advocacy group, this semester.
Although a chapter of J Street U was established at Georgetown in the fall of 2011, the group became inactive this fall after many of its members graduated. Scott Stirrett (SFS ’13) said that he hopes to re-establish the organization’s presence on campus before graduating in May.
According to Stirrett, J Street seeks to expand nationwide conversation about what it means to be pro-Israel in the United States and supports the two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16), who grew up surrounded by heavily pro-Israel relatives and felt conflicted upon learning about the actions of the Israeli government, said that the unique message of J Street U appealed to her.
“J Street says that you can be pro-Israel in that it has the right to exist without being pro-Israel in the sense that you agree with what its government is doing,” Wartenberg said.
When current President Jake Sorrells (COL ’16) approached Wartenberg earlier this year about the idea of reviving J Street U at Georgetown, she was instantly interested in the organization.
“As he was telling me more about what J Street does, I became very excited because I didn’t realize that there was an organization out there like this, that I wasn’t an outlier and [that] other people felt the same way,” Wartenberg said.
Although members of J Street U have reached out to other campus organizations, including Students for Justice in Palestine and the Georgetown Israel Alliance, they say the organization’s message is distinct.
“I feel like you have two polar sides, with Georgetown Israel Alliance and Students for Justice in Palestine,” Wartenberg said. “I don’t think there’s much dialogue and common ground. I see J Street as a good, moderate place for discussion about the conflict without disrespecting other people’s views.”
Sorrells agreed that his organization has a narrower focus than GIA.
Stirrett said that although J Street U’s work is consistent with GIA’s, J Street’s distinct status as a separate group allows it to focus on a two-state solution.
“We definitely have a very positive working relationship with GIA. GIA is a great organization, and we very much think that we have complementary goals,” Stirrett said. “They do some political advocacy in terms of pro-Israel, but J Street U has a more specific focus on ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a two-state solution, which is probably something GIA advocates for as well, but it’s not [its] main burning issue.”
“Both J Street and GIA are very much about supporting and celebrating Israel,” Sorrells added.
However, GIA Co-Vice President Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16), an Israeli-American who served in the Israel Defense Forces, disagreed with the strategies J Street uses to achieve its goals.
“The main idea of J Street is that it just has its own specific premise on social issues within Israel and social justice within Israeli society, solving all of the inequalities and problems that exist right now in Israel, and [it wants] to do that through lobbying and pressure from U.S. government officials,” Gabaisaid. “While I definitely want those changes that J Street is talking about to happen, I just believe that they should come from within the country, from within our own sovereign government.”
Despite the groups’ differences, Stirrett said that J Street U has a solid foundation to build on.
“I think it’s encouraging now that we have about two years of programming history,” he said. “I think we’ve been able to prove that this is not just a one-semester organization but something that can last longer.”
J Street U has held one general interest meeting so far that drew approximately 20 attendees. The group’s leaders hope to focus on building personal connections with other members of the organization.
“The first time around, we didn’t really focus too much on establishing a real community and building relationships with individuals … to really foment that group so we have a launching pad in the fall,”Sorrells said.
Georgetown J Street U also played host to the national organization’s regional workshop for the southeastern United States in February and sent several students to the J Street U national student conference in Washington, D.C., earlier this year.
Stirrett is confident that the future of J Street U is bright.
“I think that J Street U will continue to grow in size,” he said. “It provides a really important and valuable voice in the Georgetown community.”

Students for Justice in Palestine withdrew its co-sponsorship of a film screening with the Georgetown Israel Alliance and J Street U, an event that was supposed to herald an unprecedented collaboration between the historically contentious organizations.
The SJP board made the last-minute decision Tuesday to officially disassociate the organization from the event, after determining that it did not align with their national organization’s platform, which opposes normalization — treating Israelis and Palestinians as equals instead of the oppressor and oppressed, respectively — of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
After SJP’s withdrawal, GIA and J Street U, which advocates for a two-state solution, also withdrew their co-sponsorships, instead attending as individuals rather than representatives of their respective organizations. The screening of “The Other Son,” a French film about an Israeli and a Palestinian switched at birth, still attracted more than 100 people.
“I guess from the beginning of the time that the event was conceived I knew myself and a few others always felt a little bit uncomfortable with the event, but we continued,” SJP President Albert Doumar (SFS ’15) said. “As we began to have more reservations about it, we had to decide among ourselves how to frame the event to be suitable to our cause or an event. … There was no way to structure the event to do that.”
Doumar maintains that the Georgetown SJP chapter did not receive explicit pressure from outside groups to withdraw. While SJP leaders were apologetic for the late hour of withdrawal, they reached the conclusion that participating in an event contradictory to their ideals would have been detrimental.
“Discussions were taking place on campus between our members and we were receiving word from different groups,” he said. “It wasn’t so much backlash as [the groups] trying to explain more about normalization and trying to understand from us why we were undertaking the event.”
As publicity for the event spread, the Georgetown chapter of SJP received messages from chapters at Rutgers, Cornell and the University of Maryland College Park, among others.
“There’s a recognition that all of us are allies in the same struggle, so it was important we presented a unified front to make sure the decisions of any one SJP did not jeopardize the goals of the greater organization,” Doumar said.
Though GIA and J Street U understood SJP’s obligation to its national organization, student leaders were disappointed.
“With their withdrawal, it was a very unfavorable action because it undermined the very purpose of the event,” GIA President Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16) said. “To facilitate discussion not only on campus but beyond, we needed to use organizations that were bigger than campus.”
In October, GIA held an event with both Israeli and Palestinian guests that was designed to inspire campus discussion. Gabai hoped for the screening to be an event that would have extended the possibility of discussion beyond campus and felt that opportunity was lost when the organizations withdrew their sponsorship in favor of individual leadership.
“The minute we changed it to an individual-based event, the agenda was marginalized to an on-campus conversation,” he said. “All in all, we still have to look at the glass half-full and go on with the event.”
J Street U organizers felt that the universal decision to attend as individuals was the best way to promote dialogue, despite the sudden developments.
“In some ways it would have been a stronger collective message to show this organizational partnership to other campuses across the nation, but at the same time, we were stripped of that luxury by the sticky situation the leaders of SJP were put in,” J Street U President Jake Sorrells (SFS ’16) said. “I think that was outside our control, and we responded in a way that would allow us to capitalize on that opportunity. There was really nothing else we can do. It inadvertently strengthened our message.”
However, Sorrells maintained that SJP’s withdrawal represented the reasons why dialogue was necessary.
“I think the situation that unravelled emboldened our resolve to conduct this program,” Sorrells said. “It was sort of a microcosm of the very challenges that have typically hindered [progress].”
Gabai said he had hoped that SJP members would have broken out of the constraints of the larger national organization.
“Georgetown students are trendsetters,” Gabai said. “I was very saddened, because I thought that the board of the SJP would be able to set the trend.”
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner delivered remarks after the screening, in addition to a videotaped message from Director of Muslim Chaplaincy Imam Yahya Hendi, both university officials.
“What happened at GU does not happen elsewhere. It did happen and let’s build on that,” Hendi wrote in an email. “I am so proud of our kids, all of them, for they made it happen. [It’s] going beyond borders to build bridges.”
Gartner encouraged participating students and said that she was proud of the way the organizers handled the event.
“It would break my heart if this minor snafu derailed the process that began when they were planning this,” she said. “My prayer is that students build on the relationships they’ve made in preparing for this event, and build on what they’ve learned about themselves and one another, both in the planning stages and at the film showing itself and find a way to move forward.”
J Street U Treasurer Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16), who conceived the idea of the event, said that despite the last-minute challenges, he is hopeful for future cooperation.
“I really want to stress that we view this event as absolutely not a failure,” Jatovsky said. “We will look back on this as an evening that kickstarted the development of dialogue.”
 
Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated Imam Yahya Hendi’s title as director of Jewish chaplaincy. He is director of Muslim chaplaincy.

	A week and a half after Students for Justice in Palestine withdrew from a film screening meant to foster dialogue with pro-Israel student groups, the Jewish and Muslim Chaplaincies held Amplified Voices, a concert aiming to increase dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis through music, in Gaston Hall on Sunday.	Presented as a joint effort by the Jewish Chaplaincy, the Muslim Chaplaincy and the department of government’s master’s program in conflict resolution, the concert attracted Jewish and Arab residents, with approximately 500 attendees.	Not all students involved in last week’s screening through SJP, the Georgetown Israel Alliance or J Street U, a group that advocates for a two-state solution, were involved in the planning of this concert, despite the two events’ similar goals.	J Street U Treasurer Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16), however, did marketing for the concert and was also responsible for planning last Wednesday’s screening of “The Other Son,” a French film about a Palestinian and Israeli switched at birth, which saw the withdrawal of official sponsorship from J Street U and the Georgetown Israel Alliance in solidarity with SJP. The screening continued without official sponsorship from any Israeli or Palestinian group.	“[The concert] really was a very important event in that it played to a lot of similar themes and goals … that we believe the movie event was ultimately successful in achieving in terms of kicking off this dialogue,” he said.	He also attributed success to the formats of both events, noting the eschewal of explicit politics, despite the fact that SJP withdrew because of reluctance to appear in opposition to their organization’s national stance, which sees Israelis as oppressors and Palestinians as the oppressed.	The SJP said that treating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict purely through a cultural lens contributed to the normalization of the issue to which they are opposed.	“This kind of an event stresses these two cultures that haven’t been getting along … can come together,” SJP President Albert Doumar (SFS ’15) said. “This is the kind of idea that SJP rejects because of what it implies about the occupation. When you have an event that’s just cultural or mutual understanding, you imply that those sides have long-running grievances against the other side and those need to be solved.”	Peacebuilding Connections, a group that uses art for cross-cultural initiatives, helped plan Sunday’s concert.	“This event is here to bring together people who believe that we need to act collectively in order to solve our problems, and that peace will only come when that is the first desire on both sides,” concert producer Bob Schlehuber said.	The concert’s first act, “Heartbeat,” usually consists of more than 25 artists funded by the Israeli-Palestinian Youth Music Project. Only five of these musicians performed at this particular concert, but they had the audience on its feet for much of the time and sang in English, Hebrew and Arabic.	“I’ve grown up with this barrier wall around my country, Israel. I’ve always been afraid of the people on the other side that would hurt us if there was no wall,” Heartbeat guitarist Guy Gefen said to the audience. “But now I know that our two peoples can truly be brothers, if we wish to.”	Recording artist David Broza played part of his new album via Skype with vocalist Muhammad Mughrabi, a Palestinian rapper and East Jerusalem resident.	Broza, an Israeli, recorded his entire album in the Palestinian sector of the city and collaborated with Palestinian artists on the project, which stresses the need for peace and understanding. Haitian rapper Wyclef Jean will also appear on the album.	Andy Shallal, an Iraqi-American peace advocate who announced his candidacy for mayor of D.C. on Nov. 8, served as the event’s emcee.	“There has to be a place for peaceful dialogue in music and in politics,” Shallal said. “And that place should be front and center, because it is what the silent majority of Palestinians and Israelis really want – peace.”	Jordanian vocalist Faraj Siraj took the stage after Shallal’s speech, singing traditional Arab folk songs in Arabic, English and Spanish.	Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner spoke briefly following Siraj’s performance and cited the Muslim holy text.	“The Quran says that God made [Jews and Muslims] different not so that we will hate one another, but so that we may come to know and see each other in brotherhood,” Gartner said.	Soon after, folksinger and political peace activist Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary took the stage with his guitar to perform with his daughter Bethany, who sang with cellist Rufus Cappadocia.	Students saw these performances as a sign of the concert’s success in promoting its message.	“I think the fact that it interested these famous musicians is all the more testament for the recognition of the need to improve dialogue around campus and the creation of peaceful resolution between these two groups,” Jatovsky said.	After the concert, attendees browsed booths in Healy Hall with information about the performers and other groups involved in advocating for peace through music, including the YMCA Jerusalem Youth Chorus and the Voices of Peace Choir.	“Many people have become cynical as a result of how long the peace process is taking. But hope is free, anyone can have it, and if both sides work together to accept each other and move toward peace, then we can really accomplish something,” Schlehuber said.

After Patrick Gage (SFS ’17) arrived at Georgetown and realized that, unlike the College Democrats’ and their publication “The Progressive,” the College Republicans had no official publication, he decided to fill that void with one of his own.
In November, he began to talk to board members about spearheading one for the club, and, on Jan. 13, “The Right Way” was born.
Gage ran his own political blog in high school and felt that the experience qualified him for the job.
“It was something that they had thought of, so I figured, ‘Why don’t I just take this and run with it?’” he said. “I think it was really important also for the club, because the [Georgetown University College] Democrats have been doing it for a couple of years, and I felt that it was important that we not only match that, but try to even do better.”
On any given week, the blog will feature four posts from individual staff writers, including Gage, and one member of the GUCR board. The blog aims to publish well-researched conservative opinions on a wide range of timely issues from women’s rights to anti-abortion stances.
“We’re not aiming to be a news site,” Gage said. “We’re going for an informed editorial, is what I would call it.”
Gage has no requirements for his writers and allows them to choose their own topics.
“From my experience, if you’re told to write about something that you don’t want to write about, you’re not going to write it well. … I think that giving them freedom also really gives us a great diversity of topics other than me just choosing,” he said.
The blog values differences in opinions, including those that may not be traditionally Republican.
“There’s a diversity of opinions in the party, and that’s something you don’t really get from the media,” Gage said. “We’re showing students that Republicans do think differently. We’re not all just machines thinking exactly the same thing at the same time.”
Staff writers have published posts about support for both Israel and Palestine and legalizing marijuana, while Gage has written about opposing the death penalty and supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants.
Staff writer Alex Robledo (COL ’17) also has written about some of these more contentious viewpoints.
“It’s a mixture of what I am personally passionate about, so at least for me I’m really passionate about individual liberty, freedom, so my past articles have been about legalizing marijuana, about being more open and tolerant of gay Americans,” he said.
For Robledo, this is important because he believes college campuses are not always friendly to Republicans.
“I feel like the caricature of Republicans, at least amongst college campuses, is that we’re all of the same mold, and we all agree on the same things,” he said. “Being able to disagree over policy issues, especially within the party, and being able to do that freely, and other people being okay with that, really makes me happy, and I feel like we can learn from each other when we’re able to disagree like that.”
As of Tuesday night, “The Right Way”had received 6,667 page views, with 2,000 unique viewers. These came from 22 countries, with viewers from Jordan composing the second-largest readership after the United States.
“The Right Way” also provides a place for Republicans to express their opinions, which Gage thinks is one of the blog’s most important features.
“We really want to provide Georgetown Republicans a place to share their opinions where we can openly discuss it. It’s a way for students to almost test their opinions also, to kind of put it out there and see what people have to say about it,” he said.
“The Progressive,” which represents GUCD, acts as a platform for liberal and progressive principles, and holds more of a focus on news and current events.
“It’s largely the online newspaper for the College Dems,” Editor-in-Chief Matt Sarge (COL ’14) said. “However, it’s also meant to be a form for all progressive groups on campus, so potentially groups like H*yas for Choice or, in a very broad sense, any progressive leaning group on campus … to write and express their views.”
The online publication, which has 95 pages of articles on its website, has a staff of 12 members, many of whom both write and edit. The site also prioritizes having a steady stream of articles over having a set rotation of writers. They aim to post one to two articles per day, and writers choose their own topics, although the staff also brainstorms ideas at GUCD meetings.
“It gives me an excuse to do a little research into something that interests me during the school week,” staff writer Hayden Frye (COL ’17) said.
Last week, Frye wrote one of the website’s most popular articles, which got about 600 views, on Clay Aiken running for Congress in North Carolina. The daily views on the site range from 100 to a few hundred per day.
“It’s not all opinion and blog. It’s more of an online newspaper than a blog in a sense,” Sarge said. “A lot of articles are well-researched and link to news sites and things.”
In general, the publication supports the mission of the GUCD and follows party policy closely.
“The website speaks both to provide publicity for the College Dems and the things that they’re trying to accomplish and just to espouse the same general principles that the Democratic Party stands for,” Sarge said.
Gage believes “The Right Way” differs from “The Progressive,” in the extent to which each agrees with its respective party’s policy.
“I think ‘The Progressive,’ from what I’ve seen, does a lot to toe the party line,” he said. “I’ve never seen a “Progressive” article that says that opposes gay marriage, for example, or a “Progressive” article that is pro-life.”
Sarge feels his publication’s policy alignment stems naturally from GUCD member’s beliefs.
“We don’t necessarily go extensively out of our way to cater to [a conservative viewpoint] just because, in terms of the staff that we have, they naturally have a certain viewpoint,” Sarge said. “But occasionally they’ll have deviating viewpoints on specific policies, and we don’t in any way try to prevent them from expressing that.”
Occasionally, however, Progressive staff writers do represent dissenting viewpoints, although these are generally on less bipartisan issues.
“Typically when we’ve had people write things that are more dissenting is when there’s not a clear party line on it. We’ve had articles that oppose what President Obama did, in areas like national security issues or drone strikes,” Sarge said.
Sarge also believes that the addition of “The Right Way” to Georgetown’s media and political landscape will help increase dialogue, despite the large difference in size between the two websites.
“The College Dems are a much larger group in comparison. I don’t know how large of a site or a staff they’ll have, but in general I think the more dialogue the better,” Sarge said. “There’s obviously going to be a rivalry in the sense that [GUCD and GUCR] have somewhat opposing missions, but I think having dialogue on the other side can only serve to strengthen the arguments that we make in favor of democratic policy.”
Frye reads “The Right Way” occasionally and also welcomes the competition.
“Their articles are well written. It looks good. It looks professional, and I think it’s important to have both blogs on campus,” he said. “I’m glad that they do because without that you don’t want to have one-sided blogs coming up. You want to have both sides of any issue being represented.”
For Robledo, the size of GUCD is somewhat intimidating, but he hopes that students can still appreciate the views of “The Progressive.”
“Obviously the College Dems are the biggest organization on campus. That’s good for them, but we want to provide Hoyas with a different set of opinions that maybe they haven’t heard or maybe they aren’t really used to hearing,” he said. “We hope that this blog is a way for other people to latch onto our ideas, be exposed to them, maybe they agree with our ideas, maybe they just don’t know it, really just to create a dialogue and to try and make our ideas open to everybody.”

The Georgetown University chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine held numerous events this week, including an exhibit in the Intercultural Center Galleria and a documentary screening to raise awareness for Israeli Apartheid Week.
The events aim to raise awareness of the conditions in the region and to educate college students about the issues facing Palestinian citizens and refugees in Israel and elsewhere.
“What makes it so important is that it is an opportunity for the Palestinian voice to be heard and for us to express the simple truth about their situation without the conversation being shifted away from Palestinians under the guise of ‘balance,’ which really values the needs and desires of their colonizer,” SJP President Leila Shebaro (SFS ’15) said. “When we talk about peace and resolution, we are always talking about it on their terms, never on balanced terms and certainly never on Palestinian terms.”
As the name of the week implies, the group aims to draw attention to Israeli apartheid.
“If you look at U.N.’s definition of apartheid, what Israel is doing fits that completely,” Shebaro said.
“Twenty percent of the population of Israel proper is Palestinian, but they still face discrimination and are second class citizens.” SJP member John Flanagan (SFS ’14) said.
The week’s events featured talks with American Studies Association member Steven Salaita and journalist David Sheen, as well as a screening of the documentary “Five Broken Cameras,” a film about Palestinian non-violent resistance in the West Bank.
The Salaita lecture discussed and supported a boycott of products made in Israel or its settlements.
“As with any boycott, it’s not about the economic facets. It’s more about the symbolic power and empowering the Palestinian people and raising awareness for their situation,” Flanagan said.
The group also built an exhibit in the ICC Galleria to make students aware of the week. The exhibit features a wall, which serves as a representation of the Israeli West Bank Barrier, which has been under construction since 2003.
“It provides a barrier for the permanent, illegal settlements and essentially makes them permanent.” Flanagan said.“It’s a blatant land grab, so we wanted to expose the wall and give people a sense of its symbolic power and also its material power.”
The week’s events elicited responses from other campus groups.
“The oppression that the SJP is seeking to highlight with this week is legitimate and is the same suffering that J-Street is seeking to end,” J Street U Georgetown co-president Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ‘16) said. “The conditions in the West Bank are oppressive and brutal, and the ongoing conditions ought to offend anybody who believes in democratic principals.”
However, Jatovsky said that J Street advocates for a two-state solution, which is not generally accepted by members of the SJP, according to Shebaro. Additionally, Jatovsky expressed concerns regarding the choice of the word “apartheid” to describe the situation in Israel.
“While there may be some commonalities, to apply the word ‘apartheid’ to Israel misuses and cheapens the term.” Jatovsky said. “We believe it oversimplifies a very complex issue into zero-sum, good versus bad issue.”
Some Jewish students on campus also expressed dismay over the presentation.
“It’s very personal for me, the way that my country is being portrayed,” Georgetown Israel Alliance Vice President Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16), who formerly served as president of the organization, said.
Gabai is also an Israeli citizen who served in the Israeli Defense Force from 2008 to 2011.
“Completely negating Israel’s existence is counterproductive and completely polarizes the entire hope for peace in the region,” Gabai said. “Both sides have a stake in this, both sides should have a seat at the negotiating table, and both sides should have a right to exist. It’s not all or nothing.”
SJP, J Street U and GIA previously attempted a collaborative movie event in November but withdrew organizational support after SJP backed out, citing differences irreconcilable with their platform. Members from all three organizations still attended the program as individuals.

With Monday’s announcement of its Myriad Voices, a cross-cultural festival spanning more than two years, the Laboratory of Global Performance and Politics continues its goal of bringing together performance and theater with international affairs.
The dual vision of Cynthia Schneider, professor of diplomacy in the School of Foreign Service, and Derek Goldman, professor of theater and performance studies and artistic director of the Davis Performing Arts Center, saw the founding of the Lab, as it is commonly known, almost a year ago.
Schneider outlined a three-pronged approach to achieving the Lab’s goals of examining the intersection of theater and politics. The approach began by holding policy conversations about performances from abroad.
“We also are creating new work with our students here and having them engage with students and other people of their age in other parts of the world,” Schneider said.
The second step of the approach includes student work on the subjects presented, culminating with courses taught jointly by the two professors, attended by both students from the School of Foreign Service and the department of theater and performance studies.
The Lab’s inception stemmed from Schneider and Goldman’s commonalities. Both felt a need for the Lab when they hosted a conference in the summer of 2012 with the use of a Reflective Engagement in the Public Interest grant, bringing together people interested in the topics of theater and international affairs.
“We saw from that gathering that there was a tremendous interest and need,” Schneider said. “There are many, many other people interested in this intersection, and they had nowhere else to go. I do believe our program is unique, and so we attract a lot of interest from outside.”
The specific focus of the Lab positions it as a leader and resource in the field.
“It was out of these conversations that this vision for this partnership between theater and performance studies and the School of Foreign Service came, being a resource center for the field, being a convening space for our students in the curriculum and in programming, and really trying to bring the arts and policy world together in deeper dialogue,” Goldman said.
Goldman pointed to the energy at Georgetown with its commitment to politics, social justice and cura personalis as the perfect breeding ground for the initiative.
Over the past year, the Lab hosted theater groups from abroad for performances aiming to explore politics more deeply. Schneider highlighted the Freedom Theatre, a group from a refugee camp in Palestine who adapted the play “The Island,” a South African piece about apartheid, as a perfect example of the benefits of the Lab. The group performed at Georgetown in September.
“If it was just presented as a lecture, maybe nobody would have believed him. But instead what they saw was the story of two people in prison — and saw what that was like, their hopes, their fears, their dreams,” she said. “You learn through someone’s stories. … The most effective way — and this is just a neurological fact — to impact someone is through a story. So presenting this material in the context of play was such a powerful way to do it.”
Students who attended the event were awed by its intensely personal nature.
“Seeing ‘The Island’ taken out of its South African context and dropped into the Israeli-Palestinian situation was pretty powerful and pretty provocative, and that it was happening in the U.S. capital raised the intensity of the conversation taking place,” Ben Card (COL ’17) said. “Being in the same space as a performance humanizes politics in a way that rarely happens.”
In addition to the performances themselves, Schneider referenced policy discussions after the theatrical display as critical to the Lab, pointing to an example of Madeleine Albright speaking on her experience with Václav Havel, the first president of the Czech Republic, after “Anticodes,” a performance based on Havel’s poetry, in December.
Both professors noted that the end goal of the Lab is to use the performances to humanize and expand traditional understandings of politics, which often just focus on issues.
“Theater, because of its narrative dimensions, because of its live, interpersonal dimensions, has a real and human contact. It’s much harder in that context to dismiss the human dimensions of stories,” Goldman said.
Schneider combatted any skepticism of the medium of theater by highlighting the performance’s allowance for greater integration.
“I recognize that we’re at the School of Foreign Service. We’re not at the London School of Drama,” Schneider added. “I want the information that the people get through the performances then to be integrated into the knowledge they have already and will gain going forward about the particular subject.”
With positive feedback received from both Georgetown and the broader community thus far, the Laboratory will progress with Myriad Voices, a project involving a number of events aimed to increase understanding of majority-Muslim populations around the world.

A panel of leading Middle East experts spoke about the current Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in the Reiss Science Building on Wednesday. The panel included Ambassador Dennis Ross, Ghaith Al-Omari and Jeremy Ben-Ami.
The event was sponsored by J Street U Georgetown, the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, Georgetown College Democrats and the Georgetown Program for Jewish Civilization.
“[The] panel was a strong step in advancing constructive conversations at Georgetown surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” J Street U Treasurer Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16), who moderated the panel, wrote in an email. “It is the nuanced insight like that provided at the panel that can bridge gaps and lead to meaningful progression.”
Executive Director of the American Task Force on Palestine Al-Omari spoke out against the costs of the conflict.
“This is not a conflict we can afford to keep dragging on,” Al-Omari said. “We have seen many lives shattered by this conflict.”
Ambassador Ross, who is currently a professor in the School of Foreign Service, played a leading role in shaping U.S. involvement in the Middle East peace process under the Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations. Ross explained the personal nature of the peace process.
“In an abstract way, you contribute to something called stability, but it’s completely abstract,” Ross said. “When I began to negotiate in the Middle East, I went from dealing with issues that were abstract to issues that were highly personal.”
Ben-Ami is founder and president of J Street, a pro-peace organization that advocates a two-state solution as the means for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ben-Ami expressed a need for third-party involvement in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
“There has to be two states for two people, or else Israel loses fundamental character,” Ben-Ami said. “That simply isn’t going to happen without American involvement.”
Al-Omari echoed Ben-Ami’s commentary.
“Without a responsible third party, the two parties cannot get to it,” Al-Omari said. “They are unable to step back and do what they need to do to get out of the conflict.”
With an American-brokered peace framework soon to be presented to Israeli and Palestinian leaders, each panelist weighed in on the prospective two-state solution.
“I don’t believe if you miss this moment, it’s the end,” Ross said. “But I don’t think if you miss this moment, it’s a good thing.”
Ben-Ami and Al-Omari agreed that there is no viable alternative to a two-state solution.
“I do not see any other solution,” Al-Omari said. “One of the biggest concerns that I have is, those of us who would be in favor of a two-state solution … we will not be motivated, but the others who are against it will be very motivated.”
Although the panelists represented a varied array of backgrounds, they all agreed on the importance of a two-state solution.
“The fact that these three leading Middle East experts, despite their diverse backgrounds, found so much agreement demonstrates the wide-spread support for and recognition that the two-state solution is the key to this conflict’s resolution,” Jatovsky said.
The panelists discussed whether Secretary of State John Kerry, who is currently in Jordan brokering a peace between Israel and Palestine, could achieve a successful solution.
“Even if Kerry produces a breakthrough, I think unless a breakthrough is accompanied by immediate steps by both sides to address the sources of disbelief, a breakthrough won’t happen right now any case,” Ross said.
Al-Omari argued that Israeli and Palestinian governments are perpetuating cynicism in the region.
“Yes, there is a lot they can do and no they are not doing it,” Al-Omari said.“Part of it is saying this is a good thing and part of it is distancing themselves.”
Al-Omari predicted that a watered-down document will be a consequence of this incompetence.
“The trick of what needs to be done is how do you get the parties — the leaders themselves — to accept this, own it and to identify this success as their success in political terms and the failure as their failure,” Al-Omari said.
Ultimately, the panelists were not optimistic about the current peace negotiations.
“I think one of the great risks of this round of talks is that one of the few strands of progress can collapse,” Ben-Ami said. “The odds are that this doesn’t move forward.”
Ross explained that the regional culture and environment are important factors that need to change in order for an agreement to become more realistic.
“We do need to be doing things on the ground to change the climate so, when we buy the time, people have room to say, ‘Maybe there’s something going on in Israel,’” Ross said. “That’s the challenge we have right now.
Al-Omari disagreed with the other panelists about whether either party needs to desert its narrative in order to facilitate an agreement.
“I do not believe you should negotiate identity,” Al-Omari said. “Both sides need to show sensitivity.”
The panelists concluded on a positive note — a solution is possible regardless of whether the current talks are successful.
“[In the Middle East], what can go wrong usually goes wrong so I can’t sit up here and say, ‘I know it’s going to happen,’” Ross said.“But I can say, when all three sides don’t want a collapse, usually they find a way to manage.”

Nearly 100 Georgetown students, professors and community members gathered by the front gates Saturday, posters in hand, and began their march down M Street toward the White House, chanting, “Obama, escucha, estamos en lucha!” or “Obama, listen, we are fighting!” and “What do we want? Justice!” in protest of the record numbers of deportations that have occurred during President Obama’s time in office.
The rally, protesting the nearly 2 million deportations that have occurred under the Obama administration, was part of a National Day of Action that occurred in over 40 cities across the United States. Protesters demanded that the president use his executive power to end deportations.
“We’re asking the president to put a moratorium on deportation, because he claims that he’s the champion of immigration reform, but in the process, it doesn’t seem like immigration reform is actually going to happen anytime soon. And while this is happening there are thousands of people getting deported every day,” President for Hoyas for Immigrants Rights Citllalli Alvarez (COL ’16) said.
En route to the White House, Georgetown protesters rallied with fellow advocates marching from Mt. Pleasant in northwestern D.C. The group included a large number of local immigrants.
“It was one of the most beautiful parts of the march when both sides came together, it was very loud, it was very emotional,” said Salvador Sarmiento, National Campaign Coordinator at the National Day Labor Organizing Network, who marched with the Mt. Pleasant group.
Hoyas for Immigrant Rights board member Martin De Leon (SFS ’16) described the meeting of the two groups as one of his proudest moments as a Georgetown student.
“I think my absolute favorite part of the rally and the climax was joining the other activists in D.C at that collision point where we joined their march, and they received us with cheers, and we were cheering also. I had not felt prouder to be a Hoya until that moment. It was just amazing,” De Leon said.
Once the combined group arrived at the White House, the march joined hundreds of protesters and listened to musical performances and speakers offering personal testimonials related to immigration law and reform.
“I’m sure that they heard our cries, I’m sure they knew that we were out there. They are aware that people are very frustrated with the president, that people are sick of hearing excuses and they want to see action,” Community Organizer for D.C. Immigrants Rights Coalition Anna Duncan said.
Among the speakers was a woman who stood up to speak about her husband being deported shortly after learning she was pregnant.
“We have a broken immigration system and we can’t allow that to continue. We need to move forward,” she said. “Obama had a dream and his dream was to be president. … Now it is time to make our dreams come true.”
While led and organized by campus immigration advocacy organizations Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and the Georgetown University Immigration Coalition, the march was characterized by the participation of numerous on-campus groups including the Black House, Students for Justice in Palestine, Moviemiento Estudiantil Chican@ de Aztlán and the College Democrats.
“We’ve definitely thought that the struggle for rights for undocumented workers is something that’s really essential to the democratic cause, and it’s something a lot of Georgetown students and our members are really interested in, so that’s our main motivation for sponsoring it,” College Democrats President Chandini Jha (COL ’16) said.
De Leon also stressed the universality of this issue as one that affects everyone in D.C.
“It’s not solely Hoyas for Immigrant Rights as much as it’s also Caribbean Culture Club, it’s also College Democrats, NAACP, BSA. We’ve gotten support from all types of cultural groups, it’s not so much a restrictive issue, it’s a universal issue,” De Leon said.
Rally attendee and President of Students for Justice in Palestine Leila Shebaro (SFS ’15) addressed the similarities between the struggles of undocumented Latino immigrants in America and those of the Palestinians.
“We feel that we have a responsibility to show solidarity with these people not only because, historically, there’s a very strong tradition of solidarity between Latino communities with Palestinians,” Shebaro said. “Many of the same structures of oppression that are faced by undocumented immigrants in the U.S. are very similar to those faced by Palestinians. The same kind of cycles of economic disenfranchisement, criminalization that you see down to the point where they’re not just coincidentally similar. For example, the same companies that helped build the West Bank barrier are helping to construct the border fence.”
SJP member John Flanagan (SFS ’14) compared the criminalization and lack of basic human rights he said both groups face because of the belief held by some that they are not citizens or are unworthy of citizenship.
“I think that there’s a lot of intersections in the way that the law is used to oppress people and to deny them their basic human rights,” Flanagan said. Georgetown students who attended the march from campus and the rally praised the high levels of support from the Georgetown community.
“It’s something that very directly affects our community and it is viewed as a very separate issue a lot of the time. There is a very human dimension to it and there are families that are separated because of it,” Coordinator for the Kalmanovitz Initative’s Day Laborer Exchange Program Sophia Sepp (SFS ’14) said. “They are just trying to find a job, and they face a lot of injustice and obstacles because of their legal status. We’re all kind of interconnected.”
“As students we have a lot of power to help these people and we have a voice,” said Araceli Vazquez (COL ‘14), a member of Hoyas for Immigrant Rights and Students Stopping the Trafficking of People. “A lot of these people are barely coming out of the shadows and it’s important to push along immigration reform.”

AMMAN, Jordan — As tensions mounted in the Levant this summer, 14 Georgetown students participated in the Office of Global Education’s inaugural Summer in Amman, Jordan, program.
Shortly after the program’s start on June 6, turmoil began to escalate dramatically in the neighboring countries of Iraq and Israel and in the nearby Gaza Strip.
 
The Looming Threat of ISIS
Less than a week after Georgetown students arrived in Amman, jihadists from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria began their campaign in Iraq by seizing the northern city of Mosul.
The extremist group is currently active in Iraq and Syria but has identified Jordan as a future target. Despite public threats made by ISIS leaders in mid-June to invade Jordan and “slaughter” King Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein (MSFS ’87), students said that they did not feel a sense of imminent danger in Amman.
“I have never felt that the situation in Jordan could drastically and quickly change and become dangerous because of any personal experience or the things that I saw or the people that I met,” Amin Gharad (COL ’16) said. “At the end of the day, it was only the news I would hear about things going on all around that would cause me to fear things going down here.”
Although many Georgetown students were startled by reports of the group’s advances in Iraq, such as when it briefly gained control of the border crossing between Iraq and Jordan, locals seemed to be less concerned about ISIS’s potential military impact in Jordan. Amman is separated from the Iraqi border by nearly 200 miles of desert.
“The locals constantly talk about what’s going on, but whenever they talk about ISIS, they might talk about it in a sort of … matter of fact way, or they would even joke about it,” Rabia Mirza (COL ’16) said.
An ideology that is compatible with that of ISIS has not emerged on a large scale in Jordan, even as the group makes gains in Syria and Iraq.
“Right now, [Jordanians] are trying to be moderate in their approach. Everyone is trying to avoid being connected to ISIS in any way. … They don’t want it to come into Jordan, so there is an emphasis on the fact that Jordan is the only country right now that has stability in the region,” Yasmine Abu Tarboush, an Amman resident, said.
According to Abu Tarboush, 26, many Jordanians feel that the ideological threat posed by ISIS has the potential to be much more dangerous in Jordan than any military threat.
“People fear that it is going to become a mentality. They don’t fear that it’s going to be a security-related issue, because they realize that the intellectual aspect is what matters,” Abu Tarboush said.
Jordan plays host to hundreds of thousands of registered refugees from Syria and Iraq.
 
Turmoil in Gaza 
A much more palpable shift in morale occurred in Jordan in mid-June as tensions rose between Israel and Gaza following the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers and the subsequent murder of a Palestinian teenager. Today marks the 29th day of Israel’s Operation Protective Edge, a series of air strikes couples with a ground offensive into Gaza.
Jordan entered into a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 but popular opinion within the country generally favors Palestine. More than half of Jordan’s population of roughly 8 million identifies as Palestinian, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency estimates that there are 2 million registered Palestinian refugees within the borders of the Hashemite kingdom.
“What’s going on in Gaza has heavily impacted the citizens here, considering most of Amman’s population is of Palestinian descent. Whether they’re from Gaza or not, they express strong support and grieve for what’s going on, especially during Ramadan,” Mirza said. “A lot of people here could not properly, joyfully celebrate Eid in the way that they would have liked to.”
Although they are physically separated from the ongoing violence, many Jordanians have experienced a personal impact from Israel’s attacks on Gaza.
“I know people in Gaza and everyone in Jordan at least knows someone who knows someone in Gaza. To them, it feels personal. It doesn’t feel like it’s another country or that we should remain calm and stay out of it,” Abu Tarboush said.
Thousands of Jordanians attended a number of protests in Amman and other Jordanian cities throughout the second half of July, expressing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and calling for Hamas to strengthen its offensive against Israel.
Georgetown students are not permitted to take part in political demonstrations under the conditions of the study abroad program.
“I personally will stay away from protests. I know that there are certain mosques that you shouldn’t go to on Fridays because after Friday prayer, people stay outside and protest,” Zaynab Malik (COL ’16) said. “Being at the right place at the right time is very important here. Things can get out of hand.”
Many protestors also condemned the U.S. government for its continued support of Israel.
Although public opinion in Jordan is largely opposed to the U.S. government’s pro-Israel stance, students said that they do not feel that their status as Americans has affected their interactions with Jordanians.
“In Arab culture, they do not reflect their views about the government against the people, so it’s not like I’ve had any issues, but [Jordanians] will openly express their disapproval of the American government’s policies,” Mirza said.
 
Stability Amid Unrest
The summer program in Amman, which incorporates intensive Modern Standard Arabic studies at the second and third levels, replaced a similar summer program in Alexandria, Egypt, that was cancelled last April due to increasing political unrest within the country.
Jordan’s continued political stability in the face of mounting tensions in the region has deterred any significant security concerns comparable to those that spurred the cancellation of the Alexandria program. Georgetown students are prohibited from leaving Jordan and travelling around the region throughout the nine-week program.
“Last summer, I was upset when they cancelled the Egypt program, but I know that they did it for the right reasons and in retrospect it was the right choice,” Malik, who had planned to attend the Alexandria program last year, said. “Because I’ve had experience with that, I know that Georgetown is taking everything here seriously and if we were threatened even in the slightest way, I know that we would be evacuated.”
Although Jordan has remained stable and secure until this point, the tensions surrounding the country raise concerns about the future for many Jordanians.
“[In Jordan], we are just waiting. We expect that something horrible is going to happen, but we don’t know what it is,” Abu Tarboush said. “The threats are too many.”

After receiving 13 professors’ signatures, Georgetown has become the most-represented university involved in the American Studies Association’s boycott of Israeli academic institutions since the petition’s creation last month.
Georgetown professors who signed the boycott petition include Center for Contemporary Arab Studies Director Osama Abi-Mershed, Founding Director of the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding John Esposito, Yvonne Haddad and Judith Tucker, among other signatories.
The boycott is a part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, which aims to aid Palestinian civil society by increasing economic and political pressure on Israel. The academic petition came as a response to recent turmoil regarding the Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
Columbia University, New York University and the University of California at Berkeley follow Georgetown in representation, with 11, nine and nine signatures, respectively.
“Israeli academic institutions function as a central part of a system that has denied Palestinians their basic rights. Palestinian students face ongoing discrimination, including the suppression of Palestinian cultural events, and there is sanctioning and ongoing surveillance of Palestinian students and faculty who protest Israeli policies,” ASA’s website states.
The petition’s signatories pledge that they will not publish in Israeli academic journals, teach at Israeli institutions, attend conferences at Israeli universities or work on any projects with Israeli academic institutions.
Haddad said she signed the petition in order to expand universal academic freedom and push for peace in the region.
“I signed it because the war was promoted as Israel defending itself when in fact it was defending the longest occupation and degradation of the Palestinian population. I signed it in the hope that it would bring pressure on Israeli institutions in order to provide space for academic freedom for Israeli and Palestinian academics who are not allowed to deviate from the hasbara [public diplomacy] of the state,” Haddad wrote in an email. “[The petition]  aimed to endorse the few Israelis and the growing number of Jewish American voices that have called for a peaceful resolution of the conflict and the respect for the human rights of Palestinians whose academic institutions are raided by the Israeli military and whose classes are suspended at the whim of the occupation authorities.”
Esposito said he believed the boycott could help prevent violations of Palestinian rights.
“[I hope] to put pressure on and to boycott institutions that violate international law and as a result violate the rights of Palestinians,” Esposito wrote in an email. “There can be no excuse for the cycle of violence that has taken so many lives in Palestine/Israel over the years, and terrorized both Palestinians and Israelis, and most recently in Gaza, the slaughter of so many innocent civilians, especially women and children must be stopped.”
Tucker, who has visited the area many times since the 1980s, said she has seen the problems that Palestinian students and professors face firsthand.
“I’ve seen the situation on the ground, particularly from the vantage point of colleagues, Palestinian academics, who really have suffered enormously over the years,” Tucker said. “They can’t get books, their students can’t get to campus. These have been ongoing endemic conditions under which they live. Of course, it sometimes becomes much more critical than that when there is an active period of bombing or attacks.”
Tucker, a history professor who specializes in the Middle East, said that she believes that pledging her signature is one of the best ways she can contribute to a cause in which she believes.
“The idea is that after this long period of time, there’s been virtually no movement on getting any closer to a resolution of this conflict. How can people abroad like myself make some kind of contribution to the cause of getting a just resolution? It’s not going to come about, it would seem, through negotiations on the ground, which have stalled for many, many years,” Tucker said.
Tucker, Haddad and Esposito said that their involvement in the boycott will in no way affect their roles as professors at the university.
“Signing the petition was a personal choice and has nothing to do with my professional activity at the university,” wrote Haddad, who teaches the history of Islam and Christian-Muslim relations. “I did not speak for the university, its faculty or its administration. I will continue to teach both the Palestinian and Israeli positions. Being censored and forced to teach exclusively the Israeli position as the only truth would shortchange our students, who are being trained to be the future leaders of America.”
“They’re very separate,” Tucker said about her personal views and her professional life. “I’ve been teaching Middle East history at Georgetown for many years, and my personal views have absolutely no purchase in the classroom. For me, it’s a non-issue. I would never feel that my students should think like I do or take positions like I do on any issue.”
Georgetown professors signed similar boycott petitions in December 2013 and in 2007. University President John J. DeGioia commented on both previous boycotts, but has yet to comment on this boycott. In 2013, DeGioia expressed opposition to the boycott, but support for academic freedom of speech.
“The recent resolution of the American Studies Association endorsing a boycott of Israeli universities undermines the academic freedom that is essential to the mission of the Academy. … I recognize these are matters on which colleagues can disagree,” DeGioia wrote in a statement last year. “While the position of our university remains opposed to any boycott, we will certainly defend the rights of those who disagree.”
Nitzan Gabai (SFS ’16), Israeli student and former Georgetown Israel Alliance president, said that he agreed with DeGioia’s statement and now worries about a lack of academic freedom and discussion between opposing sides.
“I am very concerned by what would happen with the void that would be left after pushing out Israeli scholars and universities from the conversation,” Gabai said. “Without someone on the other side to ever give counterarguments or to ever check and balance the accusations that are made on one side or the other, there’s just so much room to go with extreme opinions and go with actions that lose every proportion possible.”

Counterterrorism expert Jonathan Schanzer said Palestinian politics are overlooked in the field of Middle Eastern studies in a lecture in White-Gravenor Hall on Wednesday.
The event was co-sponsored by the Georgetown Journal of International Affairs and the Georgetown Israel Alliance.
During his talk, Schanzer emphasized the fact that many people who study the Israel-Palestine conflict do so in a one-sided manner.
“Most people study the Middle East by the Israeli perspective, or the perspective of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some people might have studied the Palestinian system, but that is extremely rare,” Schanzer said.
GIA Co-President Jessica Tannenbaum (COL ’16), a staff writer for The Guide, said that she appreciated Schanzer’s perspective. 
“I think it was important for him to shift the focus just from looking at the Israeli perspective, to looking at the Palestinian perspective as well, because in order to understand this conflict, we need to look at both sides,” Tannenbaum said.
Schanzer also said he believes that having an understanding of the Palestinian political system is crucial to developing an understanding of the region, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the Israel-Palestine conflict and other major issues ongoing in the Middle East.
“The term that is used right now, a derisive term, is called linkage. If you just solved the Israel-Palestinian conflict you might be able to prevent Iran from going nuclear, the civil war in Syria and the tumult from the Arab Spring,” Schanzer said. “You might be able to prevent many things by just getting down to the core of providing the Palestinians with the state that they so desire and have been agitating for since the 1940s.”
Schanzer noted the division of the Palestinian government and how the two-state solution, which proposes the creation of two separate and autonomous states of Israel and Palestine, ignores that the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are two distinct entities separated by a barrier that Palestinians are virtually unable to cross.
“You have the Gaza strip being controlled by the Hamas and the West Bank by Fatah,” Schanzer said. “These are two separate governments, two separate funding sources, two separate police and security apparatus. These two states have not been able to agree on anything, and yet, all we have been talking about in Washington is a two-state solution.”
Event attendee Sydney Jean Gottfried (COL ’17) said that she felt like this distinction cleared up a misconception that many Americans have about Palestine.
“I thought that it was really interesting to bring to light how in Palestine there are two sides, with the Hamas and the Fatah and I think that most people don’t see that,” Gottfried said. “They just see Israel and Palestine and it can be hard to understand that within Palestine there is not a united front.”
Ian Philbrick (COL ’17), GJIA’s undergraduate online executive editor, said he agrees that there is a problem with how we narratively frame the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“The way that it is depicted in the media and the way we understand the situation as policymakers or even students is not necessary true to the situation on the ground,” Philbrick said. “There is a very dangerous disconnect between what is actually happening and the policy that we recommend.”
Schanzer called for the opening up of the Palestinian political system in order to make room for innovative leaders.
“The bottom line is that Palestinians across the board don’t like their leadership and there does not appear to be any leaders in the making,” Schanzer said. “Even if there were elections tomorrow, it is impossible to tell who would be the next layer of leadership. We are looking for the next Martin Luther King or the next Mahatma Gandhi. We need to open up the political space, and this is something that we continue to ignore.”
During a question and answer session that followed the lecture, Schanzer addressed the issues of terrorism and the threat of the Islamic State group.
“There is a common denominator across ISIS, Hamas and al-Qaida, which is a radical brand of Islam,” Schanzer said. “This is not Islam itself, it is an interpretation of Islam, which the majority of Muslims reject. I believe that the biggest fight that we are all going to face is this ideology, the fact that ISIS is drawing numbers of people and has such an allure.”
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), who attended the event, said he was satisfied with the objective view that Schanzer presented in his lecture.
“So much of the narrative around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is driven by biased and emotional content in the mainstream media and so, hearing from an objective, experienced, research fellow like Dr. Schanzer gives a greater degree of legitimacy to the discussion and allows us to focus on what is really important,” Goldstein said.

In commemoration of the lives lost during this summer’s conflict between Israel and Hamas, J Street U Georgetown hosted an apolitical candlelight vigil in Red Square in an attempt to humanize the usually politicized debate.
With the media coverage of the violence filled with statistics, J Street U wanted to focus on empathy for the human loss.
“Now many of us here, myself included, found this simple and human idea of empathy and compassion incredibly difficult to express this summer. The intense polarization of an already highly political and politicized issue often prohibited any sense of sympathy for the other side and perpetuated the idea that any such sympathy was a sign of wavering loyalty and betrayal,” J Street U Co-President Katelyn McNelis (SFS ’15) said. “Tonight we recognize that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while inherently political, transcends politics.”
Although J Street U, which promotes a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, does have a political stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they found it important that the event eschewed a political nature.
“We also do have strong political stances that we are not scared to take, but for this event we wanted to kind of put that aside and show that there was a human aspect to this that wasn’t really being shown this summer,” McNelis said. “All that was being shown was destruction and rockets but they weren’t showing the actual humanity behind what happened after and before the destruction.”
The event included narrative accounts of life for people affected by the violence. One story included that of a family bombed whose father was worried about the overwhelming fear of his children.
“‘I have learned from past experience not to let the kids see the damage that the rockets cause because it can be very traumatic,’” Noah Buyon (COL ’17), a member of the organization’s board of directors, said as a narrator.
The event was also an attempt to show that even in a polarized debate, it is possible to rise above politics to a focus on the human aspect.
“People tend to see this conflict in black and white terms and there’s a good side and a bad side and this event kind of marks a transcendence of that worldview in my mind. The way I see it, if even one person dies, it’s one person too many and so this is a very nice way of building off of that sentiment,” Buyon said.
The inability to empathize with the conflict on a more human level was in large part due to the media coverage.
“When I could see myself following the news, it was just so hard to really put it in a human perspective because after a while all you saw was numbers and all you saw was the amount of rocket attacks and the number of people killed and you kind of lost the idea that that number was a person,” McNelis said.
Mitchel Hochberg (SFS ’15), who attended the vigil, said that is gave him an opportunity to reflect on the events of the summer.
“Discussion of last summer’s conflict became incredibly polarized,” Hochberg wrote in an email. “Having a safe space to set that aside helped me remember that humanity and compassion should drive our response to needless violence.”

Are people who support Hamas akin to people who supported the Nazis?
Seems to me they are.  
Nazis destroyed all the Jews of Europe.  Hamas never stops talking about destroying Jews.  
Nazis depicted Jews as beneath contempt just as Hamas does.  Nazis blamed Jews for all their problems and so does Hamas.
Seems to me the only difference is Hamas does not have the military required to really kill off all the Jews of Israel.  If they did have these weapons everyone knows they would use them as indiscriminately as the Nazis did.
I wonder what sort of person supports an organization that is today’s Nazis.  What moral and intellectual blindness do these Nazi worshippers suffer from?

A group of protesters gathered outside the Sabra Hummus House pop-up shop on Wisconsin Avenue NW Monday evening to protest the company owners’ support of the Golani brigade of the Israeli army, in a demonstration organized by the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation.
In the intermittent rain, protesters gathered in front of the store around 6:30 p.m. carrying a large Palestinian flag and signs denouncing the store for supporting human rights violations in Palestine.
“Sabra supports the Gaza siege: let Gaza live … let Gaza breathe,” protestors chanted.
According to its website, Sabra is owned by PepsiCo, based in the U.S., and by the Strauss Group, an Israeli food company that has provided for the Golani Brigade, a fraction of Israel’s military. In addition to the Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the protesters also said that they were protesting the brigade’s “racist” T-shirts, one depicting a pregnant Muslim woman in cross hairs that read “1 shot, 2 kills,” according to the protest’s event description.
A spokesperson for the company told The New York Times in 2010 that Sabra had never contributed “hummus or anything else” to the Israeli military. Sabra faced similar pushback in 2010, when Palestinian students at Princeton and DePaul Universities protested the sale of Sabra hummus on their campuses.
“The company has no political positions or affiliations,” Sabra wrote in a comment.
In response to the protest, one customer showed his support for Israel by wearing an Israeli flag like a cape as he walked past the protesters on his way inside of the store. Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), a board member of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, said that the organization deliberately did not take any action to respond to the protest.
“GIA made a conscious decision not to stage a counter-protest on Tuesday because we are a proactive, not reactive, organization,” Goldstein said.
However, Goldstein disagreed with the aims of the protest and characterized it as divisive.
“I think the protest was short-sighted. It framed a complex conflict in black-and-white terms in which only Israel is at fault, which is neither a fair nor constructive assessment,” Goldstein said. “Not to mention the fact that boycotting a business just because it’s Israeli gets us nowhere closer to peace, mutual understanding or a two-state solution — it merely divides and antagonizes.”
Sarah Mink said that the demonstration was protesting against actions of the Israeli army and did not denounce the entire country or population.
“This isn’t anti-Israel, anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish. That’s a really common misconception that people have,” Mink said. “As a Jew, I’m really uncomfortable with Israel’s actions against human rights violations in Palestinian territories.”
GIA board member Josh Goldberg (COL ’17) also was uncomfortable with the protest, asking for students to support peaceful solutions instead.
“Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle East and therefore is an important strategic ally to the United States. Students should be aware of the current situation in the Middle East and do what they can to support a peaceful resolution,” Goldberg said.
Though Mink acknowledged the importance of peace talks, she noted that such solutions had failed in the past, requiring actions such as the protest.
“We’re of the mindset that all of the peace talks and negotiations don’t really work in diplomacy. Although we really believe in it, it is not necessarily what is going to bring about peace and end human rights violations,” Mink said.
Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine could not be reached for comment by press time.
The Sabra Hummus House will be open through Oct. 26.

While Muslims have killed up to one million in Sudan, and counting, we devote our anger on Israel for we are really just anti-Semites pretending we are humanitarians.
While Muslims in Mali have forced 500,000 (and counting) people into refugee status – as they have done in the past year – we devote our anger on Israel for we are anti-Semites pretending to be for social justice.
While Muslims kill off what remains of the ancient Hindu population in-and-around Pakistan we devote our anger on Israel for we are like the Germans during the 1930s – people who needed a convenient scapegoat to escape their own feelings of frustration.
While Muslims have wiped out all the Buddhists from their ancient homeland in Afghanistan we devote our anger on Israel for it’s easy to pick on Jews and we are shameless hypocrites engaging in man’s oldest prejudice, anti-Semitism, while pretending to be holier-than-thou.

In order to clarify my concerns, let’s take a look back in history to 1933 when Hitler rose to power and became Chancellor of Germany and the Nazis won a large number of seats in the German parliament. What followed was the notorious nationwide Nazi boycott targeting Jewish businesses and professionals directed by Nazi storm-troopers posting signs everywhere saying “Do not buy from Jews!” Widespread anti-Semitism mounted with the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 depriving Jews of their basic rights as citizens and banning them from all professional jobs in education, politics, academia and industry which escalated in severity ultimately concluding in the “Final Solution.”

“Israeli military occupation of the Gaza Strip”. The Hoya really needs to be more careful in fact checking, especially when dealing with such a sensitive issue.

Ruth Gavison, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a founding member of the Israel Association for Civil Rights, spoke about the Jewishness of Israel and its implications Wednesday in Copley Formal Lounge.
The event, sponsored by the Program for Jewish Civilization and School of Foreign Service, is the seventh PJC event of the semester.
In this lecture, Gavison focused on what Israel’s Jewish tradition means to both the Arab and Jewish citizens in Israel, as well as to Jews throughout the world.
Gavison offered a brief account of history in order to give a base for her argument. In 1947 the United Nations General Assembly made a resolution that the British Mandate for Palestine would be separated into two states, an Arab one and a Jewish one, and that each must make a commitment to respect the rights of the other group living in their territory. However, this resolution was not a conclusive solution to the tensions of the Jewish and Palestinian conflict.
“What was obvious in 1947, ’48, ’49 is not so obvious at all anymore and this is the challenge of the time and why I have to come here and talk to you about what is the meaning of the Jewishness of the state, what is the justification for that, is it okay for there to be a Jewish state and what are the implications of this identity,” Gavison said.
According to Gavison, Jews living within Israel and abroad have a political and ideological internal debate over the Jewishness of Israel.
“Among Jews in Israel there is a general acceptance that Israel is and should be a Jewish state, but there is a debate on the implication and meaning of the Jewishness of the state,” Gavison said. “Some people say the state must be governed by Jewish law. Others say most of the Jews in Israel are not religious and not observant and the Jewishness of Israel is about the right of Jews … and this is not about religion.”
Gavison spoke about the definition of the Jewishness of a state and its nuances.
“It is an ongoing conversation and the meaning of the Jewishness of the State is that the State is in part designed to allow Jews to continue to have this discussion and conversation on an ongoing basis,” Gavison said. “[It is not] to decide it once and for all, but to have the conversation within a political community, which has a territorial base on their ancient homeland in the only place in the world in which they were politically independent and the majority.”
Aditya Pande (SFS ’18) attended the lecture and was pleased that Gavison was able to make clear the core of the problem of the Jewishness of Israel.
“[There are] two states for two people, a Jewish majority state and a Palestinian majority state,” Pande said. “The only obstacle here is what is the Israeli proposal for right of return is, because if they let the Palestinians back into Israel that reduces the Jewish majority which they don’t want so that’s the solution.”
Pande said that he enjoyed the clarity of the speech.
“It was very clear,” Pande said. “She distilled her argument to one very simple point and that is that Israel should have a Jewish majority and should have self-determination. That’s why they were created. That’s why they exist.”
Also in attendance was Jonathan Morrow (COL ’18), who had attended previous lectures sponsored by PJC and was impressed with Gavison’s approach to the topic.
“It’s not just about external diplomacy. It’s not just about high level political discussions. It’s very much a grass roots discussion of what Jewishness means and what a Jewish society and government looks like,” Morrow said.

Students from Birzeit University in the West Bank spoke about violations of the right to education under Israeli occupation in an event sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine on Tuesday.
The students visited Georgetown as a stop on their U.S. Right to Education Tour, a two week trip to U.S. college campuses during which they have discussed their experiences as students in the West Bank.
The students emphasized that the conflict between Israel and Palestine affected them due to Israeli occupation.
“It’s not the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it’s the occupation. They are occupying us, our lands,” Hala Khalil, one of the students on the tour, said.
Ahmad Shwieki, another Birzeit student, said that one major violation of the right to education comes as a result of roadblocks that make it difficult for students to travel to school.
“Israel’s consistent policy is building road blocks, checkpoints, which are almost 600 by the U.N. stats,” Shwieki said. “So this consistent cutting of Palestine areas also affect Palestine students’ ability to get mobility and to reach their schools and universities.”
According to Shwieki, roadblocks restrict the schools that students can attend, and often make it difficult for particularly promising students to attend the best schools. He also claimed that the long travel times that result from the roadblocks impact students’ ability to spend a full day at school.
“Parents should be allowed to decide what school their kids go to, until the age of 15, by the international law,” Shwieki said. “We see that Palestinians don’t get to choose their school. They only find it possible to go to the nearby school because they cannot go to further schools.”
The speakers also discussed how the Israeli army’s break-ins at the university impact their quality of life.
“Occupation violates Birzeit University by breaking into the university,” Khalil said. “By breaking in, they made the campus empty by 2. Students go home at 2. The campus closes at 4. So we can’t stay on campus after 4. The library closes at 4 o’clock too so we can’t have a social life, we can’t see our friends after 4.”
Shwieki added that Israeli censorship of books permitted in Palestinian schools harms his education.
“We see that Israel controls the kind of books that get in Palestine,” Shwieki said. “Israel does not allow any book from Lebanon, does not allow any book from Syria, almost does not allow any philosophy books in Palestine.As a person who’s interested in philosophy, I rarely find books in Palestine that talk about philosophy.”
After giving their first hand accounts of experience, the students asked the audience to assist in boycotting Israel.
“Just know that supporting the oppressors is kind of being an oppressor with them,” Shwieki said.
Students for Justice in Palestine Treasurer Matt Martin (COL ’16) noted the large discrepancy between life as a Georgetown student and one at Birzeit.
“Beyond their front gates of their school are checkpoints and armored trucks. Beyond our front gates here is Washington, D.C. and everything it stands for,” Martin said.
Attendee Kathleen Bouzis (GRD ’15) felt that the right to education should be seen as a universal necessity.
“I think just the right to education is universal, no matter what your citizenship is and that no matter what the political situation is, people should have the right to be educated,” Bouzis said.

GU Fossil Free successfully scheduled a meeting with University President John J. DeGioia to discuss divestment options for the university after a  meeting with DeGioia’s Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara (GRD ’96) Thursday and a rally Friday.
At the meeting with Ferrara, GU Fossil Free demanded to meet with the DeGioia within the next week in order to have its proposal put forward to the university’s board of directors during their February 2015 meeting.
Although Ferrara was unable to schedule a meeting with DeGioia by next week since DeGioia will be in Tokyo for most of the week, he was able to secure a meeting for GU Fossil Free for Nov. 25.
Despite Ferrara’s agreement, GU Fossil Free followed through with a rally in Red Square and a march to DeGioia’s office in Healy Hall on Friday, demanding to meet with DeGioia. At the office, the students were again greeted by Ferrara who informed them that DeGioia was not on campus at that time.
Around 20 students attended the rally, including those from other campus groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine and Hoyas United for Free Speech. The students carried signs that said “Say Yes To Divest” and“1,700 Hoyas for Divestment.”
The group requested photographic proof that they had indeed stormed the office. DeGioia’s secretary obliged, and snapped a panoramic photo of the protesters and their signage.
During Thursday’s meeting with Ferrara, GU Fossil Free member Patricia Cipollitti (SFS ’15) expressed her frustration with the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility’s decision to not meet again until next semester, therefore delaying the process. She added that this contributes to GU Fossil Free’s need to speak with DeGioia.
“It’s clear that [CISR] won’t vote on it in time, so we wanted to speak to the president to convince him of the urgency of this issue and why time is of the essence for us to get on the board of directors meeting in February because we think that the CISR is unresponsive to that urgency,” Cipollitti said.
GU Fossil Free member Theo Montgomery (SFS ’17) said divestment would benefit the endowment.
“We do think that it will actually give us more [money] than traditional oil and coal investments in the future,” Montgomery said. “We think that it will actually perform better.”
Once the group reached the office, Ferrara passed on a letter that DeGioia addressed to GU Fossil Free, lauding the group’s efforts and agreeing to meet with them.
“I will be working with my colleagues on the days ahead to determine the most efficient and appropriate way to bring this matter before our board of directors,” DeGioia wrote.
Ferrara emphasized DeGioia’s intentions of cooperating with GU Fossil Free in future meetings.
“He definitely wants to meet with you. He wants to have a conversation. He wants to talk about the best and most appropriate way to get [the proposal] in front of the board of directors,” Ferrara told GU Fossil Free members.
GU Fossil Free member Mandy Lee (SFS ’17) said she felt GU Fossil Free was at a tipping point for completing its objectives, and that divestment would be a political statement for the university.
“Divestment essentially is withdrawing our investments in the top 200 fossil fuel companies,” Lee said. “What it would do is express our commitment to social responsibility in a really important way. … In a way our investments in these companies are very small. We’re a drop in the bucket, but what this does is make a huge political statement.”
Cippolliti said that she counted the day as a win for divestment and expected future success.
“I think it went well and that we made the right decision to continue on with the action because the administration responded to our requests after we had met with them but they did so because we expressed to them there was going to be a demonstration,” Cipolliti said.

The University of California, Los Angeles’ undergraduate student government voted Tuesday night to pass a resolution calling the university to divest from American companies profiting from human rights violations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to the Daily Bruin, prompting mixed reactions from Georgetown student groups.
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), a member of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, voiced his disappointment with the results of UCLA’s divestment resolution.
“I was very saddened and frustrated to hear the news of what happened at UCLA. I think it’s far outside the scope of any student government jurisdiction to work on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Goldstein said.
Mathieu Wiener (MSB ’16) decided to form a chapter of the national organization Students Supporting Israel at Georgetown on Nov. 22, partly in response to the UCLA resolution, expressing his disappointment as well.
“Speaking on behalf of SSI, as an organization that stands for pluralism and justice and public discourse, we are appalled and disgusted by the resolution that passed. The resolution only adds fuel to the fire because it demonizes and de-legitimizes the world’s sole Jewish state and alienates Israeli moderates who support peace with the Palestinians,” Wiener said.
Matt Martin (COL ’16), a member of Students for Justice in Palestine, however, expressed his support for UCLA’s decision and for the student government’s initiative.
“What’s great about UCLA’s student government voting to pressure the university to divest, is that it’s an example of students internalizing the responsibility we all have to hold groups contributing to human rights violations accountable,” Martin wrote in an email.
UCLA has now joined the six other universities to pass similar divestment resolutions, including University of California campuses at Santa Cruz, Irvine, San Diego, Riverside and Berkeley.
“It is the University of California, Los Angeles’ duty to uphold the True Bruin values of integrity, excellence, accountability and ethicality, respect for the rights and dignity of others, and promote public service that makes a positive impact in our global community, which includes the promotion of human rights, equality, and dignity for all people without distinction,” the resolution reads.
The resolution condemned companies said to violate human rights in Palestine, such as Hewlett-Packard Company for supplying Israeli military checkpoints with biometric identification which “restricted the freedom of movement of Palestinians,” General Electric for building engines for helicopters which are “systematically used in attacks on Palestinian civilians,” Caterpillar for “continually providing engineering tools and bulldozers routinely used in the demolition of Palestinian homes, as well as Cement Roadstone Holdings and Cemex for providing building materials toward means used to violate human rights.
Martin praised the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Campaign for calling for an end to these supposed human rights violations.
“The Boycott, Divestment, Sanction Campaign, is a direct call from the Palestinian Civil Society to pressure Israel to comply with international law and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” Martin wrote in an email.
Goldstein noted that although other countries have seen violence, Israel seems to be unfairly targeted in the media.
“And understandably, that makes Jewish and Israeli students feel they’re targeted, when their country is the only one in the world that’s attacked by groups, like the media,” he said.
He criticized the UCLA student government’s decision as divisive and unproductive.
“I think there are many legitimate views on how to best solve the [Israeli-Palestinian] conflict, but boycotting companies just because they’re Israeli is not one of them. It just serves to divide and destruct,” Goldstein said.
Chloe Lazarus (COL ’16), a member of GU Fossil Free, a group that urges Georgetown to divest from fossil fuel companies, said that GU Fossil Free supports divestment from companies who violate human rights.
“As a fellow social justice campaign seeking to combat the injustices associated with fossil fuel companies, GU Fossil Free supports the tactic of divesting from companies that profit at the expense of human welfare. It is clear that human rights violations are taking place and we support divestment as a means of placing pressures on amoral corporate actors as well as a way to draw public attention to overlooked instances of injustice,” Lazarus wrote in an email.
Also a member of GU Fossil Free, Goldstein said that the goals of the two groups, although both pushing for divestment, are fundamentally different in nature.
“Fossil flow divestment is a zero-sum situation, but the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is far from zero-sum,” Goldstein said.
In 2010, the Georgetown Solidarity Committee and Students for Justice in Palestine formed Georgetown, Divest!, a coalition of students calling for the university to divest from companies that are said to profit from human rights violations in Israel and Palestine.
LaMarr Billups, the Assistant Vice President for Business Policy and Planning at the time, rejected Georgetown, Divest!’s call for reform.
“At that meeting you asked if Georgetown University would divest from managed funds that own stocks in certain companies that do business with Israel. The answer to that question is no,” Billups wrote in April 2010.
Georgetown, Divest! has since been dissolved.
Georgetown University gained notoriety this fall for becoming the most-represented university in the American Studies Association’s boycott of Israeli institutions, with 13 Georgetown professors signing the boycott petition.
Part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, a global campaign aiming to end Israeli occupation and colonization of Palestinian land, establish equal rights for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel and permit the return of Palestinian refugees, the boycott petition called for signatories to not publish in Israeli academic journals, teach at Israeli institutions, attend any conferences at Israeli universities or collaborate on projects with Israeli universities.
President John J. DeGioia denounced an earlier American Studies Association boycott in a statement issued in December 2013.
“The recent resolution of the American Studies Association endorsing a boycott of Israeli universities undermines the academic freedom that is essential to the mission of the Academy,” DeGioia said in a statement. “As an academic institution, it is Georgetown’s responsibility to deepen engagement and foster dialogue between scholars and societies to enhance the entire global academic community.”
More recently, pro-Palestinian demonstrators gathered outside the Sabra Hummus House pop-up shop on Wisconsin Avenue to protest the company owners’ support of the Golani brigade of the Israeli army last month.
The U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation organized the demonstration to protest Sabra’s relationship with the Strauss Group, an Israeli food company that has served the Golani Brigade of the Israeli army, which co-owns the hummus company.

Rabbi Dr. Abraham Skorka, who co-wrote “Sobre el Cielo y la Tierra” (On Heaven and Earth) with Pope Francis, spoke about Jewish-Catholic relations as well as the need for limits on freedom of speech regarding religion in a discussion. The event was organized by the Office of the President, the Embassy of Argentina and Masorti Olami (also known as The World Council of Conservative/Masorti Synagogues) in Riggs Library Tuesday afternoon.
Skorka accompanied the pontiff as part of the papal entourage in the Middle East in May 2014. Since then the two have been working closely together in an attempt to develop meaningful dialogue between Jews and Catholics.
For Skorka, “real dialogue” involves active planning and commitment to future events as opposed to talk for the sake of talk.
“We approach each other knowing that both of us are very, very committed with the idea of real dialogue, not just tea and sympathy, but the real dialogue,” Skorka said.
Skorka then turned his focus to the role of the Catholic Church under Pope Pius XII during the Holocaust. Skorka said that that some critics say that the Pope had the opportunity to save Jews, but his silence instead permitted the death of more Jews.
Skorka also discussed the current Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the connection between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, largely due to the role of the media. For Skorka, the media have distorted the meaning of the word Zionism.
“As all of you know, the word Zionism was transformed by the media into a bad word, a bad term. And the image of the Jews in the Diaspora was distorted by the misuse and misinterpretation of the word Zionism,” Skorka said.
Program for Jewish Civilization Director Jacques Berlinerblau moderated the discussion, and said he recognized this shift from anti-Zionism into anti-Semitism.
“I see an equation that we are very familiar with in Washington that anti-Zionism degrades easily into anti-Semitism,” Berlinerblau said.
This shift towards anti-Semitism has had lethal effects, most recently with the recent terrorist attack in Paris, which targeted Jews.
“Nowadays Zionism is a kind of anti-Semitism. Think about what occurred in Paris,” Skorka said.“Okay, the conflict is in the Middle East, it is between Israel and Palestine. Why did they attack a kosher supermarket? They didn’t know exactly if the clients in the supermarket are more Zionist, against the idea of a Jewish state in Israel — they knew nothing. … The only thing they knew is ‘We must attack Jews.’ And the ideology of them is anti-Zionist.”
The question of freedom of speech that has arisen in the context of the Charlie Hebdo attack brought up a debate about the depth of media criticism. Skorka said that today’s media and public fail to evaluate information as critically and deeply as those living a generation ago. Historically, Jewish intellectuals have been strong supporters of freedom of speech.
“Here in the United States, freedom of speech has traditionally been a Jewish issue,” Berlinerblau said. “Some of the greatest defenders of the right of American freedom of speech, especially in the 1960s, were Jewish intellectuals.”
However, Skorka said he supports limited freedom of speech in cases where the speech is meant only to degrade others. Skorka said that this type of speech is only an abuse of the freedom.
Trixia Apiado (SFS ’18), who attended the event, applauded the common ground that Pope Francis and Jewish leaders have been able to reach in their dialogue.
“I’m from the Philippines and I followed Pope Francis’ visit in the Philippines this past week, so it’s nice to see another religious denomination speaking about the same thing,” Apiado said. “It’s just [about] helping the poorest no matter what their identities are and no matter what their religions are.”

The Georgetown Israel Alliance presented endorsement criteria to the Georgetown University Student Association executive candidates over the past few weeks, including language that advocated for Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish democratic state and the opposition of any Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions resolution at Georgetown.
Although all candidates eventually refused to sign an agreement, Tim Rosenberger (COL ’16) and Reno Varghese (SFS ’16) agreed to revised criteria supporting free and open discussion, a decision which received GIA’s endorsement yesterday.
At midnight today, Rosenberger and Varghese, Chris Wadibia (COL ’16) and Meredith Cheney (COL ’16), and Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Connor Rohan (COL ’16) signed a different petition written by Elijah Jatovsky (SFS ’16), co-founder and former co-president of J Street U Georgetown, which encourages campus-wide debate and discussion.
The BDS movement, which advocates for the boycott of and divestment from Israeli businesses internationally, as well as the sanctioning of the Israeli government for alleged human rights violations against Palestinians, serves as a major point of contention between Israeli and Palestinian advocacy groups on college campuses nationwide, including at Georgetown.
GIA’s initial endorsement criteria, reformulated in January, asked candidates to agree to oppose any BDS resolution.
“We affirm our support for students and student groups that advocate for Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state,” the endorsement criteria read. “We will firmly oppose any Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) resolution at Georgetown University, standing instead for positive campus dialogue that brings different Georgetown communities together around a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”
GIA Marketing and External Secretary Ari Goldstein (COL ’18) and GIA President Harper Weissburg emphasized the need to make certain student groups on campus feel intellectually and emotionally safe and secure as justification for including BDS language in the original criteria.
“We need to keep in mind those students whose intellectual and emotional security are jeopardized every time an inflammatory, degrading and anti-Israel symbol, comment or activity comes to campus,” Weissburg said.
Weissburg also emphasized when speaking to GUSA candidates that it is every student’s right to talk about BDS on campus and that it is the obligation of GUSA to always allow the conversation to occur.
“We prefaced [talks with GUSA candidates] by saying it is every students right, if they so wish, to bring BDS to campus; obviously, we are a pro-Israel organization so we don’t want it to pass, but it is every student’s right to bring it if they so wish,” Weissburg said.
Weissburg said that the GIA reached out to GUSA candidates because they want to support an open dialogue on campus. Weissburg cited Students for Justice in Palestine’s policy of anti-normalization, which prevents the group from collaborating or co-sponsoring with any campus group that support Israel.
“Thus, moving forward the possibility of co-sponsorships on an organizational level is no longer a possibility, and as a consequence of that fact, Georgetown Israel Alliance felt the only way to continue fostering a safe space for open dialogue on campus, in light of anti-normalization, was to ask for help,” Weissburg wrote in an email. “We, as GIA, can no longer ask SJP to work with us in any official capacity, therefore, we needed GUSA’s help to broker dialogue moving forward because we are no longer in a position to do so.”
The revised statement, agreed to by Rosenberger and Varghese, encourages campus dialogue and a push toward ending conflict but does not include mention of BDS.
“We affirm our support for students and student groups that advocate for Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state. We will always stand for positive campus dialogue that brings different Georgetown communities together around a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” the GIA statement signed by the Rosenberger-Varghese campaign reads.
Students for Justice in Palestine President Leila Shebaro (SFS ’15) said that BDS serves to support the rights of those in Palestine.
“The BDS call is fundamentally about supporting human rights,” Shebaro wrote in an email. “Specifically, it delineates the non-violent tactics of boycott, divestment and sanctions designed to hold governments and corporations accountable for their roles in human rights violations against Palestinians.”
However, according to the GIA, BDS movements across the country serve as hate speech, stifling the conversation of Israeli-Palestinian peace on college campuses nationwide.
“We originally chose to include language opposing a BDS resolution in the firm belief that, as hate speech, BDS has no place at Georgetown,” GIA wrote in a statement endorsing Rosenberger and Varghese. “On every campus at which a BDS resolution has been presented to student government, it has ultimately served to shut down dialogue and divide the very communities that need to come together.”
GIA presented their initial endorsement criteria to four campaigns: Sara Margolis (COL ’16) and Ryan Shymansky (COL ’16), Abbey McNaughton (COL ’16) and Will Simons (COL ’16), Wadibia and Cheney, and Rosenberger and Varghese. Margolis and Shymansky, Wadibia and Cheney, and Rosenberger and Varghese agreed to the initial wording of the group’s endorsement request, citing the inclusion of preemptively opposing a BDS resolution as stifling free expression on campus, as well as overstepping GUSA’s jurisdictional boundaries. Both tickets later retracted their support, citing initial confusion and later realization of possible repercussions of signing the statement.
“We firmly believe in the rights of all students and student groups to advocate for their beliefs in a respectful manner; however, we do not believe it is appropriate for GUSA to take a stance on international issues,” Margolis and Shymansky wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Wadibia-Cheney ticket agreed and said that GUSA was not a platform for such political agreements.
“GUSA isn’t the platform to express political views and we condemn behavior of student groups on campus attempting to corner and politicize GUSA campaigns,” Wadibia and Cheney wrote in a public statement.
The McNaughton-Simons campaign, which initially discussed supporting the leadership resolution with GIA, came to an eventual decision to not support the endorsement criteria. According to Weissburg, GIA leadership approached McNaughton and Simons three weeks ago, and their campaign manager affirmed their agreement to GIA’s original petition Jan. 22. Weissburg said that last week, McNaughton and Simons spoke with her and denied ever agreeing to the statement.
“I began the conversation by thanking them for being the first to affirm our leadership statement,” Weissburg wrote in an email. “To the shock of both Ari and I, Abbey claimed she had never actually read the leadership statement, and Will  in response looked incredulous because he as well though this had become a moot point weeks ago. The Abbey/Will campaign only came out saying they had never explicitly affirmed the statement after rumors were circulating about the possibility of other campaigns pulling out as well. Regardless of their motivation, GIA firmly believes the Abbey/Will campaign was the first to affirm our statement with its original wording. In short, this was a horrible miscommunication.”
McNaughton and Simons deny that they ever reached a full consensus on the issue, although they did participate in discussions with GIA.
“Our staff was engaged in supportive conversations with GIA leadership regarding the language for the past few weeks. In our continued conversations with GIA we did not explicitly sign on to the agreement,” McNaughton and Simons wrote in an email to The Hoya.
GUSA executive candidates Joe Luther (COL ’16) and Connor Rohan (COL ’16), who were not approached initially, as GIA assumed they were a joke ticket, affirmed in Wednesday’s vice presidential debate that they met with the GIA this week and decided against signing on to the leadership statement.
“As soon as we found out that the Joe and Connor ticket was a serious ticket, we went to them straight away,” Weissburg said.
“We received an email, we asked them to elaborate — we decided to go against it — then we met with them and we still decided to go against it,” Rohan said.
In a statement sent to candidates and campus media on Wednesday, Jatovsky called upon GUSA campaigns to sign a new leadership statement as a first step to reconciling differences and moving forward in confronting divisive issues. The Rosenberger-Varghese, Wadibia-Cheney and Luther-Rohan tickets signed this petition today at midnight. Margolis and Shymansky decided to remain in agreement with their original statement.
Jatovsky’s statement reads: “We affirm our support for students and student groups that advocate for what they believe is a constructive resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We will always stand for positive, safe and constructive campus conversations and activism that brings different Georgetown communities together around a peaceful and just resolution to this conflict.”
McNaughton and Simons did not sign Jatovsky’s petition, but instead released a statement stating their support of free discussion.
“In light of recent events, we would like to affirm our complete support for free expression and open dialogue regarding any issue on campus,” McNaughton and Simons wrote. “As individuals, we will always support positive, safe and constructive conversations and activism at Georgetown. Furthermore, we support constructive dialogue between all students and student groups that seek a peaceful and just solutions to current local, national and international issues.”
Jatovsky said he is pleased that all candidates, regardless of their decision to sign any petitions, have stated a desire to encourage free and open speech on campus.
“I believe all the candidates have addressed the issues I raised in my essay head on and have demonstrated leadership in building a campus environment that fosters constructive dialogue,” Jatovsky wrote in an email to The Hoya.
When the language of the GIA’s initial endorsement criteria was leaked to the Georgetown student body early this week, including their opposition of any BDS resolution, students turned to social media platforms and other facets of mass mobilization in opposition.
Nabeel Zewail (SFS ’15), Ziad Saqr (NHS ’15) and Aziz Saqr (NHS ’16) co-wrote an opinion piece on Facebook titled “GIA silences transparency on Israeli-Palestinian Issue in GUSA Campaign” and created a Facebook event encouraging students to attend Wednesday’s GUSA vice presidential debate to ask candidates about this particular issue.
According to Zewail, opposing the GIA endorsement criteria was fundamentally important as including a provision on preemptively opposing a BDS resolution suppressed free expression on campus.
“When I heard about this, we realized this is no way for Georgetown to operate in terms of restricting free speech on an important issue,” Zewail said.
Zewail also emphasized the need for GUSA executives to distance themselves from taking sides on international political issues. However, he advocated for GUSA executives to focus on how such issues are relevant to tangible Georgetown institutions.
“Our position is not that we want the GUSA executive to be involved in international political issues, but rather the very narrow issue of how Georgetown spends its endowment and whether it is consistent with our social justice mission,” Zewail said.
Goldstein and Weissburg said that including BDS dialogue in their endorsement statement did not serve the purpose they intended.
“We came to the realization in conversations with the campaigns and with community members, that despite our inclusion of BDS in the name of dialogue and free speech, it ended up alienating many students, alienating many students that we are hopeful to engage in dialogue with,” Goldstein said.
Jatovsky cited the BDS movement as extremely contentious, a movement that needs to be addressed cautiously because of its polarizing nature.
“What is viewed by many in the Jewish community as a movement that undermines dialogue and establishes insecurity is viewed by many in the Arab-American community as a legitimate — even necessary — political expression that addresses their frustration over the continued Israeli occupation of the West Bank and lack of diplomatic successes in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Jatovsky said.
Shebaro also emphasized the importance of GUSA serving as a venue where free speech can be expressed on campus without repercussion.
“We believe that it is GUSA’s responsibility to protect and encourage free speech, particularly about politically charged and sometimes confusing issues such as BDS, which often make for the most productive discussions,” Shebaro said. “Without creating a space to discuss BDS, we make it impossible for us as a community to educate ourselves and take an informed stance on the subject.”
While both students for and against the GIA’s endorsement criteria acknowledge that there is a ways to go in regards to fostering greater communication between groups on campus, Goldstein acknowledged that this conflict serves as a foundation to inspire future conversation and to improve Israeli-Palestinian dialogue at Georgetown in the future.
“I hope that the Palestinian and Arab community on campus can take our efforts over the past few days in good faith and the goals that we share of promoting dialogue and coming together on this issue,” Goldstein said. “I hope that the negative and positive experiences this week will build more of a ground for engagement and communication in the future.”
 
Correction: An original article stated that Margolis and Shymansky and Wadibia and Cheney agreed to the initial wording of the group’s endorsement request. In fact, Rosenberger and Varghese also agreed to the initial wording. All groups later retracted their support.

Mr. Goldstein hopes that other communities on campus will believe that GIA’s efforts were in good faith? Well, they probably won’t. Not when GIA wants to limit free debate on campus. Not when their argument is that they might feel  intellectually and emotionally insecure if someone takes a different stance and approach than theirs. Political debate is always contentious and usually rancorous. That’s a good thing; rigorous debate is the anvil on which policy is tested and refined. When the leaders of a political club try to exempt their pet cause from that process by pretending emotional fragility, it’s difficult to believe they are acting in good faith.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington, D.C., to speak to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday sparked a national debate about the politicization of Israel’s relationship with the United States and drew criticism from student organizations at Georgetown.
In his speech, which comes in advance of Israeli legislative elections March 17, Netanyahu will address the ongoing negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, urging the United States to take a stronger position in the talks. Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner (R-Ohio) invited Netanyahu to speak in an unprecedented move, as it is customary for the president to invite foreign leaders to make speeches before Congress.
Accordingly, Netanyahu’s visit has been criticized for dragging Israel into U.S. partisan divides, particularly as the relationship between the United States and Israel has largely remained a bipartisan priority despite increased polarization in Congress.
“From a bipartisan perspective, Israel is one of the few issues that has bipartisan support in Congress and by accepting a predominantly right-wing based offer — as an individual not representing Georgetown Israel Alliance, my greatest fear is turning Israel into a partisan issue,” GIA President Harper Weissburg (SFS ’17) said.
President Barack Obama will not be attending the speech and has declined to meet with the prime minister during his visit. Forty-one congressional Democrats and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are reportedly planning to boycott the speech because of the politicization of the meeting.
J Street, a national organization describing itself as “pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, pro-peace,” published a full-page advertisement in The New York Times that called for Netanyahu’s speech to be postponed until after the Iranian negotiations and the Israeli elections, which will both occur in the middle of March. Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16), co-president of Georgetown’s J Street U chapter, the student arm of J Street, noted the fraught timing of the speech.
“We would be happy for Netanyahu to come to Congress and present before them and speak to them but this moment in time it’s just not extremely appropriate essentially because there are these really sensitive negotiations occurring between U.S. officials and Iranian officials. Additionally, Israeli elections are around the corner,” Wartenberg said.
Netanyahu, however, addressed these contentions during a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on Monday, maintaining that his speech does not aim to specifically aid any Republican agenda.
“As prime minister of Israel, I have a moral obligation to speak up in the face of these threats while there is time to avert them,” Netanyahu said. “My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to Obama or the esteemed office that he holds. I have great respect for both.”
Ari Goldstein (COL ’18), who serves as marketing and external secretary for GIA but did not speak on behalf of the organization, attended Netanyahu’s speech at the AIPAC policy conference. He said that the speech did not reflect partisan issues.
“I think it sent a really strong message of unity and bipartisanship around the core interest and values which are so fundamental to the U.S.-Israel relationship, and that’s what he should have done,” Goldstein said.
Netanyahu’s speech coincides with the Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine’s Israel Apartheid Week, an annual event held at universities around the United States that protests the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip through the construction of an apartheid wall in the Intercultural Center Galleria. The week at Georgetown will run from March 2 to March 6.
SJP President Leila Shebaro (SFS ’15) also expressed discontent with Netanyahu’s invitation to Congress, although she was dissatisfied by the close relationship between the Israeli leader and the United States rather than the politicization of the partnership.
“I don’t know if you could find another leader with the same kind of record of human rights violations that consistently gets such a warm reception from American politicians,” Shebaro said.
As part of the week’s events, SJP members will gather on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol Building to protest Tuesday’s speech.
However, the SJP has faced criticism that the week, and especially the apartheid wall, is polarizing for the use of the word “apartheid” and its perceived accusatory nature.
“When an apartheid wall goes up on campus, it is an inflammatory symbol that polarizes the conversation, and it saddens me that it puts my club in a position to seem like we’re diametrically opposed to Students for Justice in Palestine, when we’re not,” Weissburg said. “We don’t get to say, ‘Oh, and I personally believe this about Netanyahu’s speech.’ We do not have the privilege of being nuanced.”
Shebaro emphasized that any open discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would bring up strongly opposing viewpoints but said the week would encourage honest reflection.
“I think that there is a difference between being antagonistic and simply being honest and being willing to have the physical conversations,” Shebaro said. “There’s nothing about what we do that we want to be unwelcoming to anyone. Our goal is really just to open up the dialogue so people feel they can have an honest conversation about the reality of the situation.”
Despite the national polarization of Netanyahu’s visit, J Street U Co-President Natalie Magioncalda (COL ’16) hoped that the university would be a place for finding common ground.
“There is so much rhetoric on both sides, and we are trying to find that space where people on all sides of the spectrum can find that common ground because there is a lot of common ground,” Magioncalda said. “It’s just very hard to see through it when you have these polarizing aspects.”

A microcosm of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict reached the Georgetown campus this week as the Georgetown branch of Students for Justice in Palestine hosted events for Israeli Apartheid Week.
The week, which is taking place this year at universities in over 55 cities and 19 countries, includes events that protest the Israeli occupation of Gaza and support the Boycotts, Divestments and Sanctions movement. According to the event’s Facebook, the week is meant “to spark reflection on the injustices inflicted upon Palestinians, raise awareness about the historical and ongoing causes of injustice and promote dialogue about these issues in a respectful … manner.”
The week included a Monday screening of “Roadmap to Apartheid,” a documentary film produced by a Jewish Israeli and a white South African. Students participated in a protest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Tuesday speech to the United States Congress. Wednesday featured a screening of “The Promise,” a film series that compares current Israel to 1940s Palestine.
“I’m excited about Wednesday’s event because I think something that often gets overlooked is the historical reality of the issue,” SJP President Leila Shebaro (SFS ’15) said. “I think it helps to frame the modern Israeli state, the Zionist project, the Palestinian experience, all of it, in the context of the different structural controls that have existed since the opening of the century, and I think it helps people understand where Palestinians are coming from.”
On Thursday, the group hosted a discussion about the BDS movement, which advocates for the boycott of and divestment from Israeli businesses, cultural and academic institutions and sanctions on the Israeli government.
SJP contends that Israel is an apartheid state discriminates against Palestinians by limiting civil rights, restricting access to roads and water and demolishing homes. The organization constructed a wall representing the Israeli West Bank Barrier in the Intercultural Center Galleria.
“We mean a lot more than the wall,” Shebaro said. “There are a lot of structural aspects of Israeli policies and institutions that are even more the reality of apartheid than the wall itself.”
Due to its national policy of anti-normalization, SJP does not collaborate or co-sponsor events with any campus group that supports Israel.
“The policy of anti-normalization is that we’ll only engage with organizations that essentially come at the situation recognizing explicitly that Israel is an occupying state and that occupation is the cause of the conflict and the violence,” Shebaro said. “We’re not going to work with an organization that is not committed to justice for all people including Palestinians.”
In response to this policy, student groups including the Georgetown Israel Alliance and J Street U Georgetown hosted their own events to share varying perspectives.
GIA created a discussion table in the ICC on Thursday to speak to students with questions about Israeli Apartheid Week. GIA President Harper Weissburg (SFS ’17) said that she would have liked to work with SJP to encourage discussion.
“We are not in a position to co-sponsor with SJP, which kills us,” Weissburg said. “We’d love to have that discussion, but because of this [anti-normalization] policy that is not in the cards.”
GIA disagrees with SJP’s claim that Israel is an apartheid state and adamantly opposes BDS.
“Israel is not an apartheid state, blanket statement,” Weissburg said. “It is a misrepresentation of the horrific apartheid in South Africa and although GIA is first to admit that Israel, like all states, is not a perfect state and yes, racism exists in Israel as it exists in all states, apartheid is the de jure institutionalization of racism, the creation of a second-class citizenry if you will. And that is not the case in Israel.”
Also due to its anti-normalization policy, SJP has refused to work with J Street U, although the organization does acknowledge Palestinian oppression and Israeli human rights violations.
“We get a lot of questions about why we don’t work with J Street in particular, because they are the more moderate organization,” Shebaro said. “I think my problem, and the institutional problem with J Street, is that they have a tendency to portray the treatment of Palestinians … as unfortunate necessities or consequences of [Palestinians] being violent or [Israelis] being provoked.”
J Street U Co-President Natalie Magioncalda (COL ’16) said that the organization opposes BDS but wants to encourage an open dialogue.
“J Street unequivocally opposes the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement,” Magioncalda said. “We are open to open dialogue around BDS, but we don’t support BDS, because we feel that illustrates the conflict in black-and-white terms.”
Co-President Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16) agreed with Magioncalda and added that she does not think BDS proposes any viable solution.
“Instead of trying to sit down and have those conversations with people on the other side … it is saying let’s reject Israel, let’s reject their institutions, let’s reject their industries and in doing this, draw attention to it. I think the only way to move forward is to have more conversations between people,” Wartenberg said.
J Street hosted its own discussion on Wednesday to discuss the SJP’s classification of Israel as an apartheid state, and even invited SJP to the event, despite the anti-normalization policy.
Wartenberg explained that J Street U’s more neutral approach to the issue and purpose of its event aimed to stimulate dialogue.
“We got involved in this week because we felt that … the rhetoric surrounding Israeli Apartheid Week hurt our cause to find peace and coexistence between the two peoples and work towards that two state solution. We felt that using words like ‘apartheid’ and ‘genocide’ made it a one-sided conversation, and polarized the conflict, delegitimized Israel in a way,” Wartenberg said. “We wanted to open up a place for discussion rather than leading the week to become more polarizing.”

Since he founded the Preparing Global Leaders Foundation, a nonprofit organization aimed at teaching leadership skills to students and young professionals three years ago, President Sam Potolicchio (COL ’02, GRD ’11) has expanded the foundation’s programs worldwide to engage hundreds of aspiring global leaders.
The foundation organizes conferences that consist of short courses and workshops on diplomatic affairs, conflict resolution, social justice and leadership skills. The conferences, which are held in Russia, Jordan and Macedonia, last one to two weeks and include around 50 participants from 40 different countries.
Currently, there are already approximately 20 Georgetown student volunteers involved in promotion, research and other duties.
Although the courses are mainly taught by professors from around the world, the conferences have hosted numerous public figures in the past few years, including Editor of Politico Magazine Garrett Graff and the former Press Secretary for the Prince of Wales Colleen Harris. In addition to lectures, participants take part in simulations, such as mock interviews and mock parliaments.
Potolicchio said that the goal of the conference is to bring together young leaders from different backgrounds.
“I believe that if you have this approach and utilize different perspectives, particularly differences of nationality, religion, race and gender, then you can cultivate a different type of mindset in aspiring public servants and leaders,” Potolicchio said.
In particular, Potolicchio said that the conferences are a platform for young leaders from conflict zones around the world to engage in dialogue with one another.
“Friendships are formed here between students from conflict zones: Serbia, Kosovo, Russia, Ukraine, Palestine, Lebanon, Israel and more. We’re really advancing some important issues here and creating a dialogue instead of just a monologue between countries that have difficulties with each other,” Potolicchio said.
Several Georgetown students and faculty have participated in previous conferences. For instance, government professor Clyde Wilcox taught a course on public speaking at the Jordan program.
PGLF Chief of Staff Danny Aherne (COL ’16) said that professors at the conferences offer their guidance even outside of the classroom.
“We try to find professors that are not only the top in their field, but that are dynamic and engaging and care about their students,” Aherne said. “At the end of the day, you want people who are not only going to engage students in class, but also outside of the class.”
Government professor Marc Morjé Howard taught a mini-course on democracy in the Moscow program and serves on the board of PGLF.
“Even though the PGLF programs are often quite, they leave a tremendous and lasting impact on the students, both personally and professionally,” Howard said. “PGLF students come away with deep and lasting cross-national friendships, along with skills that prepare them for leadership positions in their home countries and the world.”
According to Aherne, participants form close relationships with professors at the conferences.
“Our professors will eat all their meals with the students,” Aherne said. “They build sort of a family to the point where people are crying at the end just because they don’t want to see everyone go, because then they scatter back to the corners of the earth.”
Dylan Kaplan (COL ’15), who attended the program at Moscow last summer, said that he developed his leadership skills at the conference.
“One of the most important things I learned was how to improve my ability to connect with the audience when public speaking,” Kaplan said. “Dr. Potolicchio also convinced me that leadership isn’t just something you are born with, but is something you can learn and leadership can be taught.”
Additionally, Kaplan said that he formed numerous friendships with other participants.
“The program had some of the smartest students from around the world,” Kaplan said. “My favorite part was spending time with the other participants. We explored Moscow together, went out at night together and really became great friends. The participants came from the Middle East, Europe and almost every stretch of the globe. … The program was one of the most memorable weeks of my life.”
Executive Director of PGLF in Skopje and Struga, Macedonia, Angela Velkova, said that the participants, who came from various backgrounds, were able to share their culture with one another. Velkova cited the Country Presentation Night as an example, during which participants present the folklore, culture and food of their countries.
“This is a night of revelations,” Velkova said. “One cannot choose words to describe the emotions when we see unfolding in front of our eyes scenes of Iraqi participants waiving an American flag, Georgian, Russians and Ukrainians dancing ‘Casatchok,’ Serbs and Kosovars singing ‘Gjurgjevdan.’ It is a unique experience.”
This summer, the conferences will take place in Jordan and Macedonia from May 23 to 30 and August 11 to 23, respectively. In previous years, PGLF has received approximately 1,000 applications for around 50 spots.
Additionally, the foundation offers financial aid for admitted participants. According to Aherne, one of their goals is to shift to a tuition free model, which would require a significant amount of fundraising in the future.
In addition to the prospect of becoming tuition free, Potolicchio said that he hopes to expand the program to all regions of the world.
“We are progressively expanding, so we’d like to kind of have a signature school in every single region in the world, and it’s catching on,” Potolicchio said. “Almost every single delegate that comes to this program comes to me and says, ‘I want to start this program in my country.’”

As students rushed to and from their classes in the Edmund A. Walsh Memorial building this week, they passed by a nondescript gold shipping container on N Street — unaware that, inside, unprecedented conversations were taking place.
Participants who stepped into the box, titled the “Portal to Afghanistan,” were digitally transported thousands of miles away to have a full-body video chat with a complete stranger in Herat, Afghanistan.
This interactive box studio uses multimedia technology to create accessible, secure and meaningful encounters between people in Washington, D.C., and those in Afghanistan. Developed by emerging artist Amar Bakshi, Portal to Afghanistan is on display at 3622 N St. from April 7 to 18 and offers a unique experience for those interested in exploring how creative use of technology could empower cross-cultural communication. Shared Studios entirely manages and organizes each private session, and interested community members can sign up for a 15-minute session on Shared Studio’s website
“Technology really allows people to talk to one another, but too often new tools are not used to connect people who likely would not otherwise meet,” Bakshi said. “Portals grounds these technologies in a particular context and community that creates room for de-instrumentalized encounters between strangers. Often we use the tools at our disposal online to strengthen our own networks rather than reaching out to strangers across various divides. Portals provide a different avenue to create encounters between people.”
Shared Portals, which includes Portal to Afghanistan, is a major initiative under Shared Studios, a multidisciplinary arts, design and technology collective focused on connecting people from diverse populations and carving wormholes throughout the world. Inside the portals, which are modified from shipping containers and equipped with audio-visual technology, one comes face-to-face with someone in another container anywhere in the world. The two subjects then engage in a conversation as if in the same room.
Since the launch of Shared Portals in December 2014, more than a thousand people in Iran and the United States have carried on private, 15-minute conversations with strangers from the other country. In the past few months, Shared Portals placed exhibits at Yale University and the Lu Magnus Art Gallery in New York City. This time, due to a new partnership with professors at the University of Herat, Shared Portals is bringing its real-time correspondence to Afghanistan for the first time.
The Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics at Georgetown is hosting the Portal Project after reaching out to Bakshi expressing interest in collaboration. Lab Co-Founder and Co-Director Cynthia Schneider, distinguished professor in the practice of diplomacy, said that Georgetown thought the art installation would complement a larger initiative and performance by the Lab in partnership with the Georgetown Department of Performing Arts entitled “Generation (Wh)Y.” The “theatrical experience,” which will incorporate multimedia aspects, was created after Georgetown students experienced video interactions with students from Egypt, Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Qatar and Iraq, among other countries. According to the Department of Performing Arts’ website, the project will run April 17 and 18 in the Davis Performing Arts Center.
“We used intimate live performances and web-based technology and social media platforms to allow viewers to move through multiple spaces exploring real experiences from global voices and the poetry of everyday life,” DPAC Artistic Director Derek Goldman, the Lab co-founder and co-director, said. “It celebrates different encounters that people are having with folks around the world.”
Schneider said she believes that Georgetown’s portal is an invaluable chance to foster deeper cross-cultural understanding.
“In the wake of President [Mohammad Ashraf] Ghani’s visit, we have heard a hopeful message for Afghanistan’s future and for the ongoing positive cooperation between our two countries,” Schneider said. “But against that backdrop come reports of continued violence, endemic poverty, and other challenges. The Portal provides the chance to understand how ordinary Afghans view their lives and their future.”
Bakshi said he envisions that the use of technology could transform the way people communicate and shape their ideas of group identity. He also indicated that he chose shipping containers as a medium to unite participants in a common space with deep symbolism.
“Using shipping containers also has symbolic value, by making a mundane artifact more meaningful and creating a moment around it,” Bakshi said. “Shipping containers are a symbol of global commerce and a trade-centric culture. Here I want to re-purpose these containers  in a consistent way and to facilitate de-instrumentalized encounters. The myriad associations enhance this context.”
Those participating in the exchange are expected to respond to the same prompt: “What would make today a good day for you?” Bakshi said the question encourages participants to speak about details of their daily lives and touch on the small things that make a long-lasting memory for them.
During one of the 15-minute conversations that took place on Wednesday, two participants shared insights about their lives, college experiences and personal viewpoints on philosophy and religion. Afghan college student Mohammad Yones said he taught his partner on the other side of the screen greeting phrases in Persian, which carry the meaning of “I wish you happiness.”
After leaving the Portal, participants write about their experiences in a gold book, which are then published on the project’s website.
Besides the 15 minute individual appointments, the Portal can also be used for off-hours reservations for longer stretches of time, enabling artists, students or academics to converse or collaborate.
In the future, Bakshi anticipates the Portal to expand to more countries and more diverse populations. Potential future destinations include Iraq, Monrovia, Liberia and China. Shared Portals hopes to create a portal installation in a different location each month for the next six months.
“The conversation pair does not need to be super-charged,” Bakshi said. “One day you might have Moscow and Ukraine, but it could also be two parts of D.C. The idea is having two groups engage across varying forms of distance.”
“Through the Portal, I gained a friend who reminds me that education, electricity and the economy are not things to take for granted,” Ramjit said.

Five students in the Masters of Arab Studies program course “Refugees in the Arab World” began a fundraiser for Syrian and Iraqi refugees in coordination with the Collateral Repair Project this month.
The students, with help from a program graduate, are raising money by selling T-shirts featuring calligraphy designed by Syrian artist Mouneer Alshaarani. Each shirt, priced at $20, reads, “Love is my Religion.”
The group has raised $2,200 since beginning sales in Red Square April 18, and will continue to sell shirts until it reach es its goal of $6,000.
Associate Professor of cultural anthropology Rochelle Davis began teaching “Refugees in the Arab World” in 2006. The course focuses on displaced communities in the Arab world, using Sudan, Palestine and Iraq as case studies. It covers issues of humanitarianism, agency, citizenship, rights and history, with the aim of furthering an understanding of the experiences of displaced peoples.
CRP is a nonprofit based in Amman, Jordan, where thousands of Iraqi and Syrian refugees have relocated. The grassroots organization seeks to assist refugees and other victims of conflict through community-building workshops and the provision of emergency services including food vouchers, medical support and clothing.
Davis has conducted research with refugees in Jordan in conjunction with students, including Will Todman (SFS ’16). After visiting CRP, Todman decided to fundraise for the organization as a part of the course requirement to complete an action-based project.
“What we’re doing is relatively small scale,” Todman said. “But we’ve added two extra families to our food voucher scheme as a part of this fundraising, so we’re making an impact already.”
The fundraiser is also a component of CRP’s campaign “Community Grows Here,” which began April 14 and aims to raise $20,000 to support the organization’s emergency assistance and community programs.
Todman emphasized the community-based work of CRP as a component of the nonprofit that sets it apart from other organizations seeking to assist refugees.
“They’re nearly entirely operated by refugees now,” Todman said. “They’re really trying to create a sense of community within the refugee population, and they’re training refugees to be able to teach these classes themselves. So they’re not only recipients of aid, they’re also giving back to their own communities.”
Abbie Taylor (SFS ’12), another participant and former student in Davis’s course, currently works at the university’s Institute for the Study of International Migration and serves on the CRP board. Taylor highlighted the CRP’s work in assisting communities that can often be overlooked by larger non-governmental organizations.
“CRP aims to serve people who often fall through the cracks in terms of assistance, to provide the basics they need to carry on and survive,” Taylor said. “I think for this particular organization the emphasis is really on refugees as the ones who should really take the lead. It’s very much a way for them to find a new sense of community while living in a country that’s foreign to them.”
Casey Bahr (SFS ’15), one of the core fundraiser group members, stressed the pressing nature of the Syrian and Iraqi refugee crisis and the urgent need to alleviate it.
“The conflict has been going on for longer and longer, and there’s been a huge increase in donor apathy, especially in the United States,” Bahr said.
“You have a lot of these organizations that are really trying to provide assistance to these communities and unfortunately there’s been such a lack of funding. So this is really just trying to help bring these issues back to light and do what we can.”
Taylor added that in the face of the numerous ongoing crises around the world, including those in Libya, Yemen, Iraq and the Central African Republic, the situation of refugees in Jordan is often neglected.
“It’s important not to forget people who have been living as refugees for many years,” Taylor said. “A lot of the people that CRP serves have been living as refugees in Amman since 2006 and 2007, so it’s really important to remember that these people’s lives are still in such limbo.”
Additionally, Todman spoke about how the CRP is attempting to take a different approach to refugee assistance by placing a larger focus on community building.
“I think people view refugees through a humanitarian lens, that they need to be sent aid and given shelter, which is true,” Todman said. “But I also think that we need to appreciate that people want to be part of a community and rebuild social ties, to feel like they’re important and have a purpose.”

Anglican priest Naim Ateek and Mandela Institute for Palestinian Prisoners co-founder Jonathan Kuttab discussed several issues faced by the Christian minority in Israel and Palestine in a panel discussion in Copley Formal Lounge on Friday.
The event, which was titled “Christians in the Holy Land,” was organized by the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. Around 10 attendees joined Ateek and Kuttab in the discussion.
Ateek, who is a native of Palestine and a former canon of St. George’s Cathedral in Jerusalem, is the co-founder of the Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Center, an organization dedicated to overcoming denominational barriers to peace in Israel and Palestine.
Kuttab, who serves on the board of SELTC, is a practicing lawyer in Washington, D.C. and Israel, where he specializes in human rights violations and social justice in Palestine.
According to Ateek, he founded SELTC with the intention of joining Muslims and Christians together through dialogue.
“SELTC took on itself that responsibility of trying to really bring the Muslims and the Christians together,” Ateek said. “This interfaith ministry is trying to bring down any prejudices between our communities, yet there is still so much more to be done.”
As the discussion progressed, Ateek highlighted the achievements of Palestinian Christians in establishing interfaith networks and community-building institutions. He also discussed particular instances in which the Christian minority continues to be victims of racism and violence.
“[The Christian community] has a number of organizations — not only schools, but clinics, hospitals, guest houses — and we make sure there is no discrimination on any basis, including religion,” Ateek said. “Yet Israel is an apartheid state — a racist state — and racism is spiraling. Many of the outside settlers coming into Palestine are burning churches, and there is no action on the part of Israel.”
Over the course of the discussion, audience member Kathy Aquilina, the program director of local nonprofit Initiatives of Change, commented on Ateek’s views of Zionist settlers in Palestine and the violence they influence.
“One of the scourges against Palestinians are some Americans who have become stridently religious settlers who exhibit violence and racism against them,” Aquilina said. “[Palestinians] feel that the United States has continually disappointed them by not standing up for justice in the area.”
Ateek recalled his own experience with early Zionist settlers during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The conflict broke out as a result of tension between Zionists and Arabs as a result of the negative feedback to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, which displaced more than 700,000 native Palestinians.
“Israel has never treated Christians in any special way,” Ateek said. “I recall that I was a boy in 1948 when the Zionists came and occupied our town. There were Christians and Muslims living in it, and the Zionists drove us out and we had nothing. To them we were just Palestinians, and they wanted to occupy the land and everything we owned was confiscated. The discrimination going on today has continued and is against Christians and Muslims.”
Kuttab then turned the conversation toward questions on the implementation and practice of international law and human rights as a way to protect the Christian minority.
“The battle for human rights, for international law, for equality before the law, is no longer theoretical and theological and academic,” Kuttab said. “It becomes an issue of practical, daily survival. The reality is that there are laws on the book that lead necessarily to discrimination, to racism, to denial of rights. This is where we must concentrate our efforts.”
Kuttab then mentioned that while there are laws in Israel that protect individuals from racism and discrimination, these laws only apply to Israeli citizens and do not extend to non-Jewish individuals living in the Palestinian territories.
“If a system of law and a legal system grant rights to one particular portion of the population and denies it to a portion of the population on the basis of religion or race or creed, then it has a name. It is called apartheid, and it is evil and improper and worthy of a fight against it,” Kuttab said.
Afterward, the panel opened up the discussion to the audience. Fr. Drew Christiansen, S.J., the co-director of the Program on the Church and the World in the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, asked both panelists to go into further detail on the space nonviolence plays in pushing for equality and justice among Palestinians.
“I really wanted to know what space there was for nonviolence,” Christiansen said. “The Israelis don’t allow nonviolent demonstrations to occur, so the military action and police action that occur, depending on what side of the green line you’re on, most often prevent there from being any nonviolent resistance. And without that kind of space, you are going to have clashing.”
Kuttab responded to Christiansen’s question by discussing the role nonviolence should play in the activism for justice and equality, while linking the theme of this activism to faith and Christian dogma.
“I think nonviolence is the only effective method and Palestinians have practiced it intermittently with varying results,” Kuttab said. “Nonviolence has to be the only way because violence only breeds more violence. We must find a better way than to out-violence the other side. Nonviolence is the way to go.”

Boosted by a $10 million donation from the Braman family, Georgetown University officially launched the Center for Jewish Civilization, announced by University President John J. DeGioia in a campus-wide email Wednesday.
The CJC serves as an interdisciplinary teaching and research unit within the School of Foreign Service, with a focus on Jewish history, culture and civilization. The center will replace the Program for Jewish Civilization, which was originally launched in September 2003 under the leadership of Rabbi Harold White in an effort to promote an increased understanding of Jewish civilization at the university.
CJC Director Jacques Berlinerblau, who previously led the PJC, said the center will act to facilitate the study of Jewish civilization on campus.
“We see ourselves as a hub. We want to encourage and make possible the study of Judaism on the Georgetown campus, and we view ourselves almost as like the convener,” Berlinerblau said.
The center is the result of 12 years of a fundraising effort by Georgetown faculty and administrators, in which the university raised almost $11 million in endowed funds for the center from more than 500 families, and another $10 million from the Braman family to establish the Braman Endowed Professorship of the Practice of the Forensic Study of the Holocaust, a new position within the center that will be filled by Rev. Patrick Desbois, previously an adjunct professor.
The Braman family is personally connected to the study of Jewish civilization and the Holocaust, as donor Norman Braman of Miami, Fla., is the son of Holocaust survivors.
“I have decided to make this gift, now, and to Georgetown, in part as a sign of my appreciation for the leadership of Pope Francis and the priority he so clearly attaches to fostering closer relations between
Jews and Catholics,” Braman wrote in a statement to The Washington Post.
The center will primarily focus on American-Middle Eastern foreign policy as it pertains to Israel, the Holocaust and genocide and Jewish literature.
According to Berlinerblau, the focus on American-Middle Eastern foreign policy is a result of the center’s setup in the SFS.
“The first initiative, because we were in the SFS, is we wanted to become the pre-eminent school in the world that studied American-Middle Eastern foreign policy as it pertained to Israel,” Berlinerblau said. “And that of course implies that we have to also know about energy policy, oil prices, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, that’s all enfolded within Middle Eastern geopolitics.”
Berlinerblau said the university has made strides in the field of Middle Eastern studies in recent years by hiring professors such as Ambassador Dennis Ross, former Deputy National Security Advisor Elliott Abrams and Michael Oren before he became Israeli ambassador to the United States.
The center will focus heavily on research into the Holocaust, in part through the work of Desbois, according to Vice President for Advancement Bart Moore.
“It’s based on Fr. Desbois’ groundbreaking research that has established the full extent and murderous impact the Nazi’s ruthlessly effective mobile killing squad that was used in East-Central and East Europe to kill previously uncounted tens of thousands of people, in places where they did not have established concentration camps,” Moore said.
Berlinerblau said the CJC will provide a center for the experience of Jewish culture and Judaism’s role in Georgetown’s campus life.
“I would say there was a perception in the Jewish community prior to Jack DeGioia creating the CJC that Georgetown was at best indifferent and at worst not really interested at all in Jewish civilization, and whether it was right or wrong, that perception existed,” Berlinerblau said. “Well that perception doesn’t exist anymore, because everyone sees Georgetown as a friend, as an asset, as a neighbor and everything is good here.”
Moore said it has always been important to the university to increase education about Judaism.
“Fr. Healy often spoke publicly about the importance of any great university knowing and teaching the intellectual, religious and cultural traditions of the Jewish people, and I think it was, in part, a desire to complete a project initiated by Fr. Healy that this became so important to President DeGioia,” Moore said.
Berlinerblau said establishing the CJC helps ensure that the center’s work is on an equal and long-lasting footing.
“But also there is a solidity, a perpetuity, since this is $21 million of endowed money, we now know that we’re around forever,” Berlinerblau said.
According to Berlinerblau, the CJC also hopes to establish a major and master — a major in the college in Jewish civilization and a master’s program in Holocaust studies — at the university. Berlinerblau said a master’s program could be formed in two years, while the CJC is ready to move ahead with developing a major this year once it receives approval from the administration.
“We’re locked, ready, loaded and ready to go, and we need to see if we get pushback, but generally Georgetown is good with these things so I would hope that by the end of this semester we have a signal from Chet that this is something he wants to explore,” Berlinerblau said.
Moore said donors appreciated Georgetown’s commitment to Judaism.
“I think there’s a great appreciation for the respect that the university is paying to the Jewish people and their history and culture and tradition and religion by making it a priority in President DeGioia’s presidency that we have a properly funded, permanently endowed center dedicated to Jewish studies,” Moore said.
John Davison (GSB ’87), who donated to help establish the PJC in 2003 and then the CJC, said the reasons behind his donations have changed over the past 12 years.
“I feel like I’m no longer giving to something to alleviate a problem, I’m giving to something to make the center more substantial and to attract greater teaching talent, would be how my perspective has changed,” Davison said.
Director of Jewish Chaplaincy Rabbi Rachel Gartner added that there is a significant level of interest for Jewish education on campus.
“From my perspective as the rabbi on this campus, I can say that there is a thirst for more Jewish knowledge in our Jewish student community and there is an interest in learning about Judaism among students from other backgrounds as well,” Gartner said. “So I think this center serves a need and will be met with terrific enthusiasm among the students.”
Professor Ori Soltes said he was excited about the prospect of expanding the understanding of Jewish civilization at a Catholic university.
“All those kinds of cross-communications that the greater visibility will hopefully make it even more effective as an instrument to serve that purpose, from at least the angle of Judaism and its relation to Catholicism, Christianity at large, Islam and what have you,” Soltes said.
Maddy Budman (COL ’18), a GUish intern at Georgetown University Campus Ministry, wrote in an email to The Hoya that she hopes the center will help advance the curriculum relating to Jewish studies.
“I hope that the center launch will bring more attention to the CJC, leading us to things like a better physical office space and more administrative support,” Budman wrote. “I’ve seen a shift recently in the PJC from purely Israel-Palestine and Holocaust classes to literature and theology and more creative humanities classes, and I think that the center launch will help encourage the continuing of this diversity in curriculum.”
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18), who is a member of the Georgetown Israel Alliance and Alpha Epsilon Pi, wrote in an email to The Hoya that he is also excited for the center.
“I think that the launching of the CJC will promote Jewish life on campus for both Jews and non-Jews. At a school like Georgetown, I think that offering students a way to learn about Judaism, anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, and Israel (although the Holocaust and Israel can be seen in a “non-Jewish context”) is the best way to promote Jewish life and allow students to engage in Semitic studies,” Shinbrot wrote.

Former Anti-Defamation League National Director and Holocaust survivor Abraham Foxman characterized the global status of anti-Semitism today as more dire than at any point since World War II during a lecture delivered in the Copley Formal Lounge on Feb. 23.
The event, titled “Reflections on Recent Anti-Semitism,” addressed topics ranging from attitudes toward Jews in the Middle East to anti-Israel demonstrations on college campuses.
Foxman specifically highlighted protests ahead of the formal launch of the new Center for Jewish Civilization and Georgetown’s Conference on Understanding Contemporary European Anti-Semitism, which both occurred Feb. 22.
Foxman, who was born in Poland in 1940 and survived the annihilation of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, prefaced his remarks by cautioning against the rise of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who holds the highest poll numbers in the GOP election despite divisive comments about banning Muslims and deporting illegal immigrants.
“Mr. Trump comes in and breaks all the taboos about what is a civil compact in our society, that unwritten code of what is acceptable and what is not,” Foxman said. “When we watch every single day another taboo broken, and people hesitant to challenge that breaking of the taboo, it is beginning to undermine everything the common sense and respect that has served us and other minorities well.”
Following his comments on the political situation in America, Foxman contrasted the plight of Jews in the United States and Europe. He claimed that contemporary European Jews are confronted with lamentable situations in their home countries: They are faced with violence as well as discriminatory legislation that targets practices such as circumcision and kosher slaughtering.
“If Jews leave Europe because they cannot live there as Jews, because authorities send messages that ‘we don’t want you,’ because authorities say ‘yeah, you can stay but not as a Jew,’ they’re left with this haunting problem of whether or not to stay,” Foxman said. “And if they don’t stay, Hitler will have a posthumous victory.”
Foxman cited evidence compiled by the Anti-Defamation League over the past two years in a poll gauging levels of anti-Semitism in over 100 countries. The survey identified respondents to harbor anti-Semitic attitudes if they answered “true” to six or more of 11 statements describing negative Jewish stereotypes.
The ADL found that 26 percent of approximately 4.2 billion adults surveyed harbored anti-Semitic attitudes, with the highest averages in the Middle East and North Africa region at 74 percent.
Using the ADL data, Foxman said Jews in the United States are 10 times more likely to be targeted than any other religious group.
“Measuring anti-Semitism is not scientific, but if it acts like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it’s a duck,” Foxman said. “To find that a quarter of the adult population of the world is infected with serious anti-Semitism, and that the number one thing is that Jews cannot be trusted, that’s just very serious.”
As a staunch advocate for Israel, Foxman pronounced most criticism against Zionism to be rooted in anti-Semitism. He asserted that Israel is subjected to a double standard and unfairly chastised for acting in ways that other countries can with impunity.
“Israel is far from perfect. What other country in the world cannot decide where its capital is? Is there another country in the world that has to defend its right to defend itself?” Foxman said. “If you’re anti-Zionist, the only way you’re not an anti-Semite is if they are one of the unique ones in the world who reject all nationalism.”
Foxman said that anti-Zionist attitudes are increasingly evident on college campuses such as Vassar, University of Wisconsin-Madison and Stanford. He explained that pro-Palestinian demonstrations in those schools may result in hostile climates for Jewish students. In January 2016, students at Wisconsin taped paper swastikas and a picture of Adolf Hitler on a Jewish student’s dorm room door.
“It never starts as anti-Semitism,” Foxman said. “It begins as advocacy and morphs and metastasizes very quickly into anti-Semitism. In these demonstrations by students for Palestine where they place eviction notices on students’ doors to symbolize Palestinians being evicted, they post it on the Cohens’, the Greenbergs’, the Goldsteins’ dorms.”
Following his address, Foxman answered questions from the audience about topics such as Jewish attitudes to the Syrian refugee crisis, the condition of Jews in Ireland and the implications of Jewish migration from Europe.
Annabelle Timsit (SFS ’17), who attended the event, said Foxman’s lecture reflected the rampant anti-Semitism she witnessed while growing up and attending public school in France.
“I was very much impacted in class when we talked about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and I heard some very anti-Semitic remarks from students in class,” Timsit said. “Even teachers said, not knowing I was Jewish, ‘Oh, but it’s expected, because these are Jews and they come in and they take over and become more powerful than anybody else’ or, ‘Well, something would have been done about this a long time ago except Jews have control of politics in France.’”
Retired U.S. Foreign Service Officer Ilya Levin, who also attended the event, noted how, during years of service abroad, he found post-World War II Europe riddled with subtle anti-Semitism.
“I went to a country, and they started a center of Jewish tolerance,” Levin said. “I told the director, as a naturalized American and a Jew, the name sounded kind of wrong. You tolerate an unwanted guest. You do not have to ‘tolerate’ someone who is part of your family. It’s the sort of thing here, in America, we take for granted.”
Adam Shinbrot (COL ’18) said certain aspects of the lecture rang more true than others.
“I’ve definitely witnessed anti-Zionism on campus, and obviously Georgetown is inherently political, and these are conversations that need to be had, but holding Israel to a different standard, I agree that is anti-Semitism,” Shinbrot said. “But something that is troubling for me to believe is that if Europe’s Jews have to leave, that is another victory for Hitler. That is very tough for me to hear, and I’m not sure I believe that completely.”

Tensions flared among student groups invested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after the vandalism of a makeshift wall created by Georgetown’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine in the Intercultural Center Galleria on March 14.
The wall was put up during Israeli Apartheid Week, which is held in over 150 universities worldwide, and aimed at symbolizing the Israeli West Bank barrier while spotlighting alleged injustices associated with the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza strip.
In addition to the wall, SJP’s programming included events such as a “Faith Washing,” which combatted the view of the conflict as a religious issue, and a discussion on why the SJP uses the term “apartheid” to characterize Israeli settlement.
The defacement included marker etchings and messages over the newspaper clippings, flyers, statistics and photographs pinned to the wall, which was taken down Sunday. The perpetrators of the vandalism have not been identified as of press time. One featured the wall’s title scribbled over and replaced with “International Anti-Israel Week 2016.” Another message invoked a quote by former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, stating, “Peace will come when Arabs love their children more than they hate Jews.”
SJP Chair Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17) said she found the messages to be anti-Arab and verging on Islamophobic.
“We were shocked,” Abdelfadeel said. “This is a big issue — it’s bigger than any of us. We’ve done it multiple times in the past and on an annual basis, and we’ve heard from people but no one has ever gone so far as to vandalize our wall.”
The Georgetown University Police Department dispatched a criminal investigation unit to interview affiliated students, witnesses and suspects of the vandalism. GUPD Chief Jay Gruber said apprehended suspects could face criminal charges relating to property destruction and a referral to the Office of Student Conduct.
“Georgetown University is a place where this kind of activity really isn’t tolerated,” Gruber said. “We’re supposed to be a place where you’re allowed to express your feelings or your thoughts without somebody coming up and causing damage to that, so hopefully this was just an isolated incident.”
Assistant Director of Student Engagement Lauren Gagliardi spoke on behalf of the Center for Student Engagement and offered its support to the SJP following the vandalism.
“The university considers acts of hate and bias unacceptable and antithetical to its commitment to an inclusive and respectful community,” Gagliardi wrote in an email to The Hoya.
The Georgetown Israel Alliance and J Street U Georgetown, both pro-Israel organizations, have condemned the vandalism of the SJP’s wall.
GIA President Daniel Silbert (COL ’18) said he found SJP’s display one-sided and divisive but emphasized that the GIA would never respond to provocative displays with vandalism.
“If I come face-to-face with whoever did this, I’d say what you did was wrong because you defaced another campus organization’s property, which is against campus rules. It’s disrespectful, but even furthermore, it’s a horrible representation of the pro-Israel community,” Silbert said. “That’s not what we stand for, and if you are upset by what’s being said on that wall, when you respond by writing on it and defacing it, you’re just bringing more attention to it and giving their baseless claims even more attention.”
Molly Wartenberg (SFS ’16), former co-chair and current treasurer of J Street, attributed the politically charged use of the term “apartheid” as fueling the tensions that resulted in the wall’s vandalism.
“One of my main oppositions to it is that it suggests Israel is this horrible apartheid state when there is a huge difference between Israel proper and the occupied territories of the West Bank. I just think glossing over it with one word removes all nuance from the conversation and is also just very inflammatory for everyone,” Wartenberg said.
SJP member Matt Martin (COL ’16) said the term aptly calls attention to the parallels between the colonial oppression of black South Africans and Palestinians.
“Apartheid is an Afrikaans word meaning ‘separateness,’ and that is exactly what is in Israel-Palestine today — separateness,” Martin said. “It’s explicit, and it’s in their laws that are often very discriminatory against Palestinians and all sort of things. It doesn’t seek to equate Israel with apartheid South Africa but to highlight similarities and to then provoke conversation and critical thinking.”
In response to Israel Apartheid Week, the GIA launched a campaign calling for increased dialogue with members of the SJP. Silbert argued the SJP’s anti-normalization policy, which argues that debates between the two sides should be resisted because the process legitimizes pro-Israel positions, has stifled dialogue.
“If their goal is to promote peace and a solution to the conflict in Israel, not talking to the other side, and saying you’re not going to talk to the other side, is never going to move towards peace. It’s just going to alienate people away from your cause,” Silbert said.
Abdelfadeel said the anti-normalization policy is rooted in the philosophical principle that pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian positions are not morally equivalent sides.
“Israel has exercised settler-colonial policies against the Palestinians who have suffered immensely under this, and we don’t think it’s fair and it’s actually really, really absurd for anyone to suggest that an occupied people negotiate or talk or dialogue with the occupier,” Abdelfadeel said.
In light of Israel Apartheid Week and the vandalism, Martin criticized the university’s response to the vandalism, claiming its lack of formal statement is an unwelcome sign of how seriously it considers the rights of student groups.
“I anticipate and hope that the university will be more outspoken about vandalism on campus and take the rights of student groups seriously no matter what views they represent,” Martin said.

Approximately 30 Georgetown University Fossil Free members and supporters gathered to demand socially responsible investments and more transparency from the board of directors’ Socially Responsible Investments Committee — including restricting investments in gun manufacturing and fossil fuel companies — at a rally hosted by GUFF in Red Square on Wednesday.
The rally, which was titled “Follow the Money” and previewed by an event page and introductory video on Facebook, was co-sponsored by 10 student organizations, including Georgetown Against Gun Violence, Georgetown University Amnesty International, H*yas for Choice, Georgetown Israel Alliance, Georgetown Refugee Action, Georgetown Secular Student Alliance, Georgetown Solidarity Committee and Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine.
Members of GUFF, accompanied by a group of protestors, met after the protest with Chief of Staff of the Office of the President Joe Ferrara and Vice President for Public Affairs Erik Smulson to deliver a list of written demands.
The protestors’ requests primarily included the creation and development of a university-wide socially responsible investment policy, which would include a public list of companies and industries the university should refrain from investing in based on its core Jesuit values.
After action by GUFF, the university voted to cease direct investment in coal companies in June 2015, and currently does not provide a public list of energy companies in its endowment.
Additionally, GUFF requested that the university reconstruct the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility and institute an additional institute an additional board of directors working group to uphold the policy and include students in the process.
Protestors are also seeking the development by the university of an investment transparency website to publicly disclose any connections between Georgetown’s investments and personal connections within the board of directors or other major donors.
According to GUFF member Caroline James (COL ’16), the purpose of the rally was to raise awareness for the lack of clear and public university policy on investment.
“We’ve had a lot of frustration with the university bureaucracy and basically finding that there isn’t a university-wide policy about what we will and will not invest in,” James said. “So we decided to have a ‘follow-the-money’ rally to show that other groups have a vested interest in seeing the university have this policy.”
According to a statement issued by Ferrara following the rally, the board of directors will review the list of demands.
“We will share the demands with the board of directors committee that is reviewing socially responsible investing,” Ferrara wrote in a statement to The Hoya.
GUFF member Grady Willard (SFS ’18), who attended the meeting, said the group’s conversation with Ferrara was a step in the right direction, but hopes the administration will continue to be receptive to students’ demands in order for progress to be made.
“I thought it was a very effective meeting. We elaborated on our demands and engaged in a discussion of topics related to student engagement, socially responsible investment, board transparency, and CISR reform,” Willard said. “We feel like both of them were very receptive to our overall argument, and look forward to engaging more with them and the board of directors in the future.”
Aaron Bennett (COL ’19), who attended the rally, said the protestors’ messages and demands for change were moving.
“I think it’s great that Georgetown students are deciding to speak out against some of the lack of transparency and socially irresponsible funding on behalf of Georgetown University,” Bennett said.
GUFF member Brendan Stelmach (SFS ’19) said the demands are essential to better align the university’s policies with Jesuit values, and hopes the university will more carefully consider the ways it utilizes its endowment in the future.
“One of the most meaningful ways that, as students, we can show our support for protection against climate change is by campaigning to change how we invest our endowment,” Stelmach said. “It’s a direct representation of us as students and I think that by putting some of these changes in place we can move towards being more representative of what Georgetown is truly about.”

A group of around six students protested during and after a panel discussion on the politics and policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held by the Center for Jewish Civilization in Gaston Hall on Thursday evening.
During the question-and-answer section of the panel, the group of students got up and began chanting pro-Palestinian and anti-Netanyahu phrases before being escorted out of Gaston Hall by GUPD officers.
Outside of Healy Hall, the students held posters with messages such as “Netanyahu is a war criminal.”
The panel, entitled “The Netanyahu Premiership: A Retrospective,” was moderated by Georgetown CJC professor Elliott Abrams, who formerly served as White House adviser on U.S. Middle East policy. The event featured specialists of Middle East policy, including Natasha Mozgovaya, former Chief U.S. Correspondent for Israeli newspaper Haaretz, and Benny Morris, a Goldman Visiting Israeli Professor and Israeli historian.
In a statement to The Hoya, two of the student protestors, Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17) and MacKenzie Foy (COL ’19), said the panel was biased against Palestine and failed to include a diverse set of views.
“We want to bring visibility to the normalization of Netanyahu’s war crimes to campus and the oppression faced by Palestinian people at the hands of the Israeli state. We are concerned that a conversation about the Israeli state took place without talking about it as an occupation, as an apartheid,” Abdelfadeel said. “Georgetown as a Jesuit institution needs to be held accountable for its complicity in this and all state violence.”
One of the protestors held up a poster with a quote by Morris from a 2004 interview he conducted with the Haartez, in which he apparently refers to Palestinians as animals.
“Something like a cage has to be built for them. I know that sounds terrible. It is really cruel. But there is no choice,” Morris said in 2004. “There is a wild animal there that has to be locked up in one way or another.”
While the purpose of the event was to address Netanyahu’s strengths and weaknesses as prime minister of Israel, the audience drove the conversation toward Netanyahu’s actions concerning the Gaza Strip and the West Bank during the question-and-answer portion.
Alex Coopersmith (COL ’19), who attended the panel, said the panel and the questions asked showed the diversity of opinions in the Georgetown community.
“There were questions of ranging from, ‘Why are you not calling Israel a genocidal state?’ or ‘How come there were no Palestinians talking about this issue [at the event]?’ to questions that were very, very pro-Netanyahu,” Coopersmith said. “So I think it said the Georgetown community on the other hand values the role that question-and-answer plays instead of just one side.”
CJC Director Jacques Berlinerblau, CJC Associate Director Dennis McManus, CJC Center Manager Anna Dubinksy and CJC Events and Program Coordinator Michelyne Chavez did not respond to requests for comment as of 2:30 a.m. today.
Elodie Currier (SFS ’19), who attended the event, said the panelists tactfully tackled the complexity of Netanyahu’s actions.
“For the most part the panel did a really great job of keeping things civil and recognizing the nuance of things,” Currier wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Personally, I was really impressed with the panel’s ability to handle the protesters and to assuage questions that were at times just clear criticisms of Israel in general.”
According to Carol Hillman, a D.C. resident who attended the discussion, the protestors were unreasonable in their actions.
“It was a very interesting discussion about Netanyahu. Of course the Palestinian situation was brought into the conversation, but I don’t think it was a reason for a group of angry Palestinians to be in the conversation,” Hillman said. “It wasn’t about them, it was about Netanyahu and his behavior.”

Georgetown University Forming a Radically Ethical Endowment Coalition, a student-organized group seeking  transparency in Georgetown’s endowment, demanded the university to divest from private prisons and companies that contribute to the “occupation of Palestine,” during a launch rally in Red Square Dec. 7.
Chris Morris (COL ’19), an organizer for GU F.R.E.E, said such investments contribute to human rights abuses both in the United States and abroad.
“We came together today to hold the university accountable for its role in perpetuating state violence with a specific goal of publicizing Georgetown’s holdings and companies which consistently and knowingly endanger human life,” Morris said.
According to a press release released by the campaign, students from GU F.R.E.E submitted a proposal to the Committee on Investment and Social Responsibility Oct. 12 requesting transparency on the university’s investments but have yet to receive a reply.
The coalition, which is endorsed by 17 students groups,  has also sent a letter to University President John J. DeGioia requesting confirmation that the university’s endowment is not invested in any companies that support private prisons or the “occupation of Palestine.” The letter demands a response by Jan. 13.
While members of GU F.R.E.E met with Chief Investment Officer Michael Barry and Associate Vice President of Operations Christina Roberts, Morris said the administration has not acted upon their request that Georgetown divest from companies perpetuating state violence.
“We find it hypocritical and disingenuous for Georgetown, a Jesuit academic institution, to profit off of the oppression,” Morris said. “Does cura personalis only apply when it doesn’t impact our investment returns? Is faith and justice limited by supply and demand?”
The coalition is endorsed by groups representing underrepresented populations and groups that advocate Palestinian independence from Israel, including the Georgetown chapter of the NAACP and GU Students for Justice in Palestine.
The Jewish Student Alliance, J Street U Georgetown and the Georgetown Israel Alliance are not members of the coalition.
Advocacy group Hoyas Against Hate released an online petition Sunday evening calling for the university to condemn the GU F.R.E.E. campaign.
“An anti-Israel proposal being heard by Georgetown University’s Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility (CISR) is misleading and one-sided,” the petition writes. “Supporting this proposal means perpetuating conflict and bringing hate to the Georgetown community. Rejecting this proposal means refusing to allow hate to divide our campus.”
Hoyas Against Hate did not respond to a request for comment as of 11:30 p.m.
GU F.R.E.E. said that while the group is planning to expand the coalition, it does not plan to invite J Street U Georgetown, which advocates for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. The national J Street organization does not support the Boycott, Divestment, Sanction movement because the BDS movement does not support a two-state solution, according to the J Street website.
“We are still in the process of building our coalition and will be meeting with more groups as the campaign progresses,” the group wrote in an email to The Hoya. “We have not contacted nor do we intend to contact J Street U as their national charter explicitly condemn the BDS call from Palestinian civil society, which our call for divestment from companies that empower the Israeli occupation serve as a direct a response to.”
GU F.R.E.E said in a press release Georgetown’s investments should uphold the university’s values.
“Georgetown’s investments are not currently public, so there is no accountability for knowing what companies the university is invested in,” the statement reads.  “If the university is invested in state violence, that violates its Jesuit values.”
The coalition has been consulting with members of environmental advocacy group GU Fossil Free, which is currently pursuing a socially responsible investment policy with the university’s Board of Directors’ Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, which makes recommendations on socially responsible investments to the university.
The initiative comes after the board voted in June 2015 to divest from all coal companies.
GUFF member Grady Willard (SFS ’18) said the group has been pursuing a socially responsible investment policy beyond divestment from fossil fuels in the last year and a half.
Willard said an official statement of divestment from the university would carry weight regardless of whether Georgetown is actually investing in these controversial areas.
“Even if Georgetown is not invested in a particular issue, there is some merit to the university saying they’re divesting from that issue because there’s something about Georgetown saying we don’t condone this,” Willard said.
One of the campaign organizers Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ‘17) said the GU F.R.E.E campaign seeks to provide justice to those who deserve it.
“We want to affirm the agency of the Palestinian people. They, like all people, are entitled to tangible justice,” Abdelfadeel said. “We recognize that peace is impossible without justice, so we proudly endorse the 2005 call of Boycott Divestment Sanctions as a tool to hold Israel accountable for its crimes.”
MacKenzie Foy (COL ’19), who is an organizer for GU F.R.E.E., said Georgetown’s investment in private prisons is akin to continuing the legacy of slavery.
“There’s no legacy of slavery more present in American life than prisons. The university fails to end its complicity in practices which are antithetical to our foundational Jesuit principles,” Foy said. “While our president may assert our university’s commitment to justice, there have only been halfhearted efforts to follow through on promises of reconciliation. Reconciliation looks like divestment.”
Morris said this campaign is a way for students to fight back against state violence.
“Holding our university accountable is fighting back. Divestment is fighting back,” Morris said. “We have nothing to lose but our chains.”

Israeli actions, including the development of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, are putting the pursuit of a two-state solution to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict at risk, according to Maen Rashid Areikat, chief representative of the General Delegation of the Palestinian Liberation Organization to the United States, in the Bunn ICC Auditorium on Thursday.
“The best approach to resolve this conflict is going back to the basics. The basics of freedom, human rights, dignity, security, peace for all,” Areikat said. “If we all can agree that every nation, every people are entitled to the same rights, to the same privileges, to the same freedoms that other nations are entitled to, I believe we can always find a solution to the most difficult issues.”
School of Foreign Service professor Tamara Sonn, the Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani Professor in the History of Islam, introduced Areikat, who addressed a crowd of about 150.
Areikat said the United States, under President Donald J. Trump’s administration, must work with Israel to pursue a two-state solution. Areikat criticized the Trump administration’s reported efforts to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which both Palestine and Israel claim as their capital.
“They will only embolden Israel to be more aggressive and to rely on the logic of power instead of the power of logic in dealing with its neighbors and resolving conflicts,” Areikat said.
While promoting a peaceful resolution to the conflict, Areikat blamed the strife’s perpetuity on Israeli intransigence, suggesting that a continuation of Israel’s settlement policy in the West Bank could lead to a failure of the two-state solution.
Both Israel and Palestine have said a two-state solution, with an independent State of Israel and State of Palestine, is their preferred solution to the conflict. The two sides, however, have been unable to agree on border placement, among other issues, in attempts to strike a deal.
“We still believe that a two-state solution is the most ideal outcome for any political negotiations with Israel,” Areikat said. “Israelis and Palestinians must be separated in order for them—especially Palestinians—to develop their own national identity away from occupation and oppression, and for Israelis to reap the fruits of the peace and security that they have long desired.”
The PLO officially recognized the right of Israel to exist in the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords. According to Areikat, Palestine does not pose a danger to Israel.
However, Areikat said the only path to stability for Israel in the region is a settlement with Palestine.
“Israel’s security will be guaranteed if they make peace with the Palestinians who are going to share the land with them. They cannot make peace with any other Arab countries if they cannot make peace with us. They will never enjoy security,” Areikat said. “It’s not because we are threatening them; it’s because there will be no stability if we Palestinians do not feel that we are getting our rights back.”
Delta Phi Epsilon, Georgetown’s professional foreign service fraternity, arranged the event, but as an unrecognized student group without access to benefits, needed Sonn to reserve the auditorium.
Areikat said Arabs and Palestinians prioritize resolving this conflict, even if some Israel advocates say surrounding Arab nations do not care about it as much as other conflicts in the region.
“No matter what Israel tries to portray that Arab countries are busy and the Palestinian issue is on the backburner – maybe that applies to some Arab governments, but it does not apply to the Arab masses who continue to believe that the Palestinian people are an oppressed people who need to win their freedom,” Areikat said. “We continue to extend our hands for peace, but it takes two to tango.”

The Georgetown administration declined to disclose a list of companies the university invests in, following advocacy group Georgetown University Forming a Radically Ethical Endowment Coalition’s request last month to create a more transparent endowment.
GU F.R.E.E, which has been endorsed by 17 student groups, submitted a letter Dec. 7 to University President John J. DeGioia demanding that the university divest from investments in private prisons and companies that contribute to the “occupation of Palestine.”
The group set a deadline for a response by Jan. 13, which university officials missed.
Members of GU F.R.E.E. want more transparency from university officials about how Georgetown uses its endowment.
The coalition is endorsed by groups advocating for underrepresented populations and groups that support Palestinian independence from Israel, including the Georgetown chapter of the NAACP as well as GU Students for Justice in Palestine.
The Jewish Student Alliance, J Street U Georgetown and the Georgetown Israel Alliance are not members of the coalition.
Chief of Staff Joseph Ferrara said in an email to GU F.R.E.E. provided to The Hoya that the university’s standard practice is to not disclose its investments.
GU F.R.E.E. said the campaign will continue to press for a list of investments.
“The administration’s refusal to sign our letter indicates to us that we have some sort of relationship with the named companies and as such, we will move forward with our campaign,” GU F.R.E.E. wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Senior Director for Strategic Communications Rachel Pugh said the university’s Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, which advises the university on its investments, is considering the demands listed in the group’s December letter.
J Street U Georgetown said in a statement that “Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions” movements like GU F.R.E.E’s are ineffective in achieving a two-state solution, its preferred solution to the conflict between Palestine and Israel. J Street instead called for constructive criticism of Israeli policy rather than calls for taking away funding for Israeli companies.
“We do not believe that B.D.S. movements are an effective or helpful way to to end the conflict and reach a peaceful resolution,” the statement reads. “We encourage positive reinvestment into the Palestinian economy and civil society and diplomatic negotiation as a means to achieve a lasting peace agreement.”
GU F.R.E.E. has said it did not plan on inviting J Street U Georgetown.
J Street U’s statement, however, noted that those involved with GU F.R.E.E. have been willing to discuss their position with student groups opposed to their message. The group affirmed their support for Palestinian rights.
“We have met with individuals involved in the GU FREE campaign and appreciate their willingness to explain their position and support the safety of all students on campus,” the statement read.
GU F.R.E.E. launched an official website and campaign Wednesday. The group plans to raise awareness of the issues affecting underrepresented populations as it pushes the university to pursue a more transparent endowment, according to the group.
“We intend to raise awareness and constructive conversation surrounding both issues to problematize the normalization of these human rights violations,” the statement reads. “We plan to put pressure on the University until it recognizes the glaring contradictions of our Jesuit values and subsidization of state violence via our investment practices.”

Political tensions are putting progress toward a peace deal between Israel and Palestine on hold according to think tank The Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy fellows Ghaith al-Omari and David Makovsky in the Healey Family Student Center Social Room on Tuesday.
“What are the main threats right now? I think it is politics. Often, people — they look at this conflict and say that it’s unsolvable,” al-Omari said. “These are difficult issues that I believe are solvable.”
A new student initiative, Georgetown Bipartisan Pro-Israel Dialogue, hosted the panelists to discuss the future of U.S.-Israel relations, for its first-ever event.
The event was co-sponsored by Georgetown University College Democrats, Georgetown University College Republicans, Georgetown Israel Alliance, J Street U Georgetown, the Georgetown Bipartisan Coalition and the foreign policy discussion group Alexander Hamilton Society. GBPID Director Matthew Gregory (SFS ’17) moderated the event.
Al-Omari has been a negotiator for the Palestinian Authority and the executive director of the American Task Force on Palestine, an organization that promotes Palestinian statehood in the United States.
Makovsky has served as a senior advisor to the Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations and as the executive editor of The Jerusalem Post.
Al-Omari said domestic political troubles in both Israel and Palestine are making progress on a peace deal challenging.
“On the Israeli side, we see a coalition that is quite right-wing, a coalition that cannot, in its current formulation, actually make the concession that would let us reach a peace deal,” al-Omari said. “And on the Palestinian side, what do we see? We see a divided politic. We see a president who is in the twelfth year of a four-year term. We see a parliament that is also long defunct. We see the Palestinian public — 80 percent of Palestinians believe the government is corrupt.”
According to Al-Omari, although most Israelis and Palestinians believe that peace is desirable, they fear that peace is not possible.
The two sides were able to make progress towards peace under former President Barack Obama’s administration, according to Makovsky, but regional troubles in the aftermath of the Arab Spring prevented a deal from being reached.
Makovsky stressed the success of the Obama administration in improving the borders and security of Israel.
President Donald Trump has made a series of policy announcements with respect to Israel, from planning to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, to charging Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner, who is also Trump’s son-in-law, with the task of advancing peace in the region.
The nature of the situation regarding U.S.-Israel relations in the Trump administration, al-Omari said, is uncertain as of yet.
“What we don’t know, we simply do not know, in foreign policy, at least, in the Middle East, where this administration is. We will not know for a while. Policy is not only made by a president,” al-Omari said. “So, on foreign policy as yet, I am withholding judgment. If I were to judge, I would even say cautiously optimistic.”
Al-Omari said the early policy indications are positive.
“On the Palestinian-Israeli issue, I think, frankly, political things aside, he has shown restraint,” al-Omari said. “He came as a president who was against the establishment, yet, as I look at the practice at the embassy — not moving any time soon.”
Makovsky said it is important to be optimistic regarding the ability to make progress toward a peace deal.
“There’s always, in the American imagination, the idea of American interest and American values,” Makovsky said. “I think what [al-Omari] said was accurate: don’t write things off so fast, because the way our leaders have reacted over the Iran nuclear deal and the other issues where they thought that the U.S. would—they thought the U.S. was going to throw them over the edge.”
Gregory said GBPID is looking to establish dialogue on the peace process with guaranteed Israeli sovereignty.
“The fundamental premise upon which this program is based, however, is actually quite simple,” Gregory said. “Once parties agree to accept Israel’s right to exist as a sovereign state, particularly one retaining its Jewish and democratic character, only then may constructive dialogue be held to determine how best to go about achieving peace in the region.”

The Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility plans to advise the board of directors to establish a policy of no direct investment in private prison companies and to avoid commingled funds with investments in private prison companies “to the maximum extent possible,” according to a memo published by the committee today.
CISR also concluded that divestment would not be effective in promoting a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The committee’s memo comes in response to a petition submitted by Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17), Sophia Bauerschmidt Sweeney (COL ’17) and Salma Khamis (SFS ’17) to Georgetown in October, which demanded that the university divest from private prison companies and companies that contribute to the “occupation of Palestine.”
After its review of the proposal, CISR has concluded by a majority vote that the proposal does not merit consideration by the board of directors. Specifically, the committee took issue with the petition’s request to divest from companies and funds that have investments in the private prison industry.
“CISR found that these companies do not have sufficiently direct involvement in the industry,” the report stated.
In the memo, CISR also recommended that the university use other methods of exploring peaceful resolutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“In reaching this conclusion, the Committee took into consideration the views of University community members, many of whom are deeply concerned about this conflict and have many different perspectives and ideas on how to address it,” the report stated. “CISR encourages the Georgetown community to use the resources of our university – academic research, teaching and learning, co–curricular programming, and community–based service – to create dialogue, foster understanding, and explore peaceful solutions to this conflict.”
In its original proposal, which was endorsed by at least 17 student groups, the three students requested that the university publicly disclose its investments, setting a deadline by Jan. 13. In late January, University Chief of Staff Joe Ferrara declined the group’s request, citing that it is not the university’s standard practice to disclose investments.
This article will be updated as more information becomes available.
Clarification: An earlier version of this article stated the GU F.R.E.E. submitted the proposal. It was independently submitted by three students.

Eman says 
March 2, 2017 at 7:06 pm
Thanks for covering this! Just a few clarifications.
1.  GU F.R.E.E. did not submit this proposal; the 3 students that you listed this.
2. We submitted this in October, not December.
3. The occupation of Palestine is legally recognized and not a matter of opinion so I’m not sure why the Hoya has always put it in quotation marks in your pieces.

President Donald Trump’s stated commitment to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict presents an opportunity for renewed negotiation between the two regions, according to two experts on the Middle Eastern dispute speaking Monday night.
The panel, convened by the Georgetown Bipartisan Pro-Israel Dialogue, featured former ambassador Dennis Ross, who has worked in multiple administrations as a key diplomat to Israel and Palestine, and Colin Kahl, former Vice President Joe Biden’s National Security Adviser and associate professor in the Security Studies Program at the School of Foreign Service, identified flaws in former President Barack Obama’s relations with Israel and urged Trump to inspire hope for a solution.
Ross said there was not any considerable progress toward Israeli-Palestinian peace in the Obama years, arguing that the Obama administration’s choice to make its objective to improve Israeli-Palestinian relations public was a key failure, especially negotiating Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Golan Heights in Syria.
Obama promoted a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine throughout his presidency, and increased foreign military funding for the Israeli military from $2.9 billion in 2011 to $ 3.1 billion in 2012, while former secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and John Kerry criticized settlements.
“One of the things that was done early was to declare that there had to be a big freeze, including on natural growth, on settling,” Ross said. “Had the administration framed that issue differently, talking about a limitation of settlement activity, it would have put itself in a different position.”
Kahl countered Ross, stressing the Obama administration’s close relationship with Israeli security networks.
“Where Obama doesn’t get enough credit was just the unbelievable depth of the security and intelligence relationship that Obama fostered with Israel,” Kahl said.
Kahl said factors beyond the Obama administration’s control spoiled potential for progress, like the difference between Obama’s and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s personalities. This clash of personalities made negotiations difficult.
“For Obama to really be able to effectively put pressure on Netanyahu, he had to establish a certain degree of credibility with the Israeli public, which he never did,” Kahl said.
Both Ross and Kahl agreed that the current state of Israeli-Palestinian relations is bleak. Most recently, the Israeli military and Gaza-based militant group Hamas fought a three-monthlong war that killed 2,100 Palestinians and 73 Israelis. Israel continues to blockade Gaza and build settlements in the West Bank and Golan Heights.
“When you look at where the Israelis and the Palestinians are, I’ve worked on this issue for 30 years, and there has never been a lower level of belief on either side than there is today,” Ross said.
Looking forward, the speakers held that, despite their initial doubts on Trump’s commitment to policy issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the new administration has an opportunity to bring both sides together.
Trump tasked his son-in-law Jared Kushner in January with leading negotiations between Israeli and Palestinian leaders and has suggested he supports a two-state solution, even after endorsing a one-state framework at a Feb. 15 press conference with Netanyahu.
“You might not have predicted that this would be an issue that’s important to President Trump,” Ross said.
Still, Kahl warned that Trump may not care personally about the issue, which may scuttle long-term commitment. He pointed to recent administration moves in the United Nations and the State Department to urge Netanyahu to reduce Israeli settlements as examples of this inconsistency between rhetoric and policy.
“Some of the groups furthest to the right inside Israeli politics were quite bullish on Trump, hoping that in essence it would be open season for establishing a greater Israel,” Kahl said. “Actually the Trump administration has done a number of things to walk that perception back. They’ve actually done a fairly mild brushback pitch on settlements, suggesting that it’s not helpful, Trump himself suggesting the Israelis will have to make compromises.”
Leaving hard policy aside, the two speakers concluded that the biggest problem holding back peace, and the one that the Trump administration must address if it wants to stabilize the area, is the disillusionment of the public.
“The biggest danger we have is the complete absence of hope,” Kahl said. “I think there needs to be some way for this administration to rejuvenate hope for the prospects of two states.”

Three hundred members of the LGBTQ community and allies gathered at the ninth annual Lavender Graduation ceremony to celebrate the accomplishments of the class of 2017 in the Healey Family Student Center Great Room last night.
Organized by the LGBTQ Resource Center and the Tagliabue Initiative for LGBTQ Life, the celebration recognized 113 students from all undergraduate and graduate schools of Georgetown University. It featured speeches from Dean of Students and Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Dr. Jeanne Lord, University President John J. DeGioia, Fr. Michael A. Zampelli, S.J. (CAS ’82) and senior speaker Luke Brown (COL ’17).
Additional awards were presented to six students and one faculty member for their work surrounding the LGBTQ community, as well as to the center’s 10 undergraduate Out for Change fellows, who participated in a yearlong initiative to explore “queer masculinities.”
With standing room only and attendance by numerous staff and faculty, this year’s ceremony is an example of how LGBTQ initiatives on campus have grown since the first official Lavender Graduation in 2009, according to LGBTQ Resource Center Director Shiva Subbaraman.
Although students had been hosting their own ceremonies for many years before, Lavender Gradation has expanded in size and support every year it has been held, Subbaraman said.
“The most joyful thing about this has been the numbers and numbers of faculty and staff and other administrators who come out to show love and support for our students. It’s quite amazing. President DeGioia has come since 2012. It’s one ceremony he will not miss no matter what happens,” Subbaraman said in an interview with The Hoya.
DeGioia said Lavender Graduation is an important tradition to recognize the roles members of the LGBTQ community play on campus.
“Each of you has made your own unique and lasting contributions to our university. You’ve enlivened our mission with your passion and talents. You’ve enriched and strengthened our university in countless ways,” DeGioia said in his address to the graduates.
Zampelli, who was an executive producer of the Mask and Bauble Dramatic Society during his time at Georgetown, is the first Jesuit to speak at Lavender Graduation. He has done pastoral work with LGBTQ Catholics through the Catholic Association for Lesbian and Gay Ministry.
At the ceremony, Zampelli reflected on his experience at Georgetown when he faced the decision to stand with LGBTQ friends. He said his commitment to the LGBTQ community today was “born out of a failure.”
“Something deep inside pulled me toward the conversation in which people were laboring to understand more adequately a range of identities, sexual, religious, political. Something deep inside pulled me, and I did nothing,” Zampelli said.
The question of how to address silence surrounding issues of oppression was the theme of Brown’s reflection on his time at Georgetown. Brown opened his speech by recognizing that he was the fourth white cisgender male to address the audience during the event, and addressing that as a white cisgender male, his experience navigating identity issues at Georgetown has come with a significant amount of privilege.
“I have been welcomed here on the Hilltop in the fullness of my gay identity, yet I know not everyone can point to such a cookie-cutter, picture-perfect narrative as mine,” Brown said. “We, white people, men, cis people and other privileged identities especially, must remember that marginalization and oppression do not exist somewhere out in the world. Rather they work through us and in us, whether or not we acknowledge that fact.”
Lavender Graduation was held during the final week of classes, rather than closer to other commencement activities in mid-May, because many LGBTQ-identified students or allies are unable to celebrate their identities with their families, according to LGBTQ Resource Center Assistant Director Julian Haas.
“In response to that shame and guilt, this large ceremony of the entire campus community is really our way of saying, ‘We are proud of you despite what other things go on in our life. Because you are LGBTQ, we are proud of you’,” Haas said in an interview with The Hoya.
Brown expressed his pride and gratitude for the class of 2017 and recognized many of its accomplishments, including organizing around the sale of 272 slaves to settle Georgetown’s debt and demanding answers about Georgetown’s investment in prisons and occupied Palestine.
“You have turned a school into a home for me, and I think I can say this without exaggeration, thousands of other students,” Brown said. “You have showed me the person I one day hope to be.”

Georgetown will not invest in private prison companies in keeping with the university’s Socially Responsible Investing Policy, the university announced yesterday.
The board’s Committee on Finance and Administration, which oversees the university’s management of financial resources, accepted the recommendation of the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, announced in March, for the university to avoid investments in private prison companies. CISR makes recommendations to the board on ethical investment policies and consists of 12 members, including faculty, administrators and three students.
The university will “encourage” its external investment managers to “avoid investing in the companies,” according to a university news release Thursday, which said the decision continues an existing practice.
The decision follows the board’s approval of a broad SRI policy in June, which established a general ethical framework for the university’s investment policy. The guidelines broadly require the university to consider the social and environmental impact of companies in which it invests.
Though the SRI Policy requires the university to make “reasonable efforts” toward these goals, it did not strictly require any new divestments, nor did it mandate any policies that would compromise the university’s financial interests. Investments discouraged under the policy include companies involved in providing abortion services, as well as companies deemed to violate “human dignity.”
The recommendation that the university establish a policy of “no direct investment” in private prisons passed in March by a majority vote of the CISR. The recommendation followed a divestment proposal submitted in January by three students: Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17), Sophie Bauerschmidt Sweeney (COL ’17) and Salma Khamis (SFS ’17).
The students’ proposal advocated divestment from “all private prison companies and companies that sustain private prisons,” as well as divestment from “companies that knowingly and consistently enable and profit” from the “violent Israeli occupation of Palestine.”
CISR adopted a narrower version of the students’ proposal on private prisons, recommending divestment from private prison companies themselves but excluding any judgment on investing in any other companies that are themselves invested in private prisons.
“The Committee determined it is inconsistent with Georgetown’s Catholic and Jesuit values to hold investments in companies that profit from the incarceration of human beings,” a CISR memo announcing the recommendation read.
While partially supporting the students’ petition on private prisons, the CISR rejected the divestment from Israeli occupation, citing Georgetown community members’ “many different perspectives” on how to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and doubts that the university’s divestment would be an “effective tactic” to end hostilities.

Hey Jeff, our proposal did not include “divestment from Israel” as you stated above. We proposed a very targeted divestment from companies that contribute to the many types of violence against the Palestinians living under occupation. None of the companies are Israeli. This is a gross mischaracterization that the Hoya has consistently propogated since you began covering the CISR process. We worked very hard on this proposal and wish that people would take the time to read the details before framing it as “anti-Israel.” More information can be found at gufreeorg.wordpress.com.

Student activists who pushed Georgetown University to commit not to invest in private prison companies now say the university is unfairly taking the credit for their activism in an Oct. 5 news release announcing the new policy.
The university announced the policy after a committee of the university’s board of directors accepted a March recommendation of the Committee on Investments and Social Responsibility, which makes recommendations to the board on ethical investment policies. Under the new policy, the university will encourage its external investment managers to avoid investments in private prison companies.
What the university’s announcement mentioned only briefly, however, was how the proposal came to the CISR in the first place: It was submitted by Eman Abdelfadeel (COL ’17), Sophie Bauerschmidt Sweeney (COL ’17) and Salma Khamis (SFS ’17), and accompanied by a three-month campaign launched last December by the student group Georgetown University Forming a Radically Ethical Endowment.
Abdelfadeel said the university’s statement took credit for the change while only briefly alluding to student involvement.
“Understating the fact that this was a call from students is indicative of a trend of the administration being unresponsive to the demands of the wider community and then taking credit for the work once it has become socially and/or financially appropriate for them to do the right things,” Abdelfadeel said.
The release made one reference to the students’ involvement, saying the CISR “reviewed a student proposal that included a request that the university divest from the private prison industry.”
“After finding investing in the private prison industry to be inconsistent with Georgetown’s commitment to socially responsible investing – which is reflected in the new SRI policy, CISR submitted a recommendation to the board that supported this strategy,” the release said.
A discussion of the activism that led up to the decision is lacking from the campus conversation, according to Christian Morris (COL ’19), a student organizer for GU F.R.E.E.
“I feel like it was worked for,” Morris said. “I want to bring it back to the fact that student activism, student pressure and conversations are happening. I haven’t heard anything about the demonstrations we did last year, or the events that we disrupted, or the proposal we submitted through Georgetown’s bureaucratic loopholes.”
A university spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.
This is not the first time students have criticized the university for taking credit for activists’ efforts.
Lily Ryan (COL ’18), a member of the workers’ rights student activist group Georgetown Solidarity Committee, said the administration failed to acknowledge GSC’s role in a 2016 dispute with the university over its licensing contract with Nike.
Students associated with the GSC staged a 35-hour sit-in last December in the office of University President John J. DeGioia, demanding the university cut its contract with Nike unless the company agreed to allow independent workers’ rights inspections of its factories. After hours of negotiations between students and university administrators, the university ultimately agreed to the students’ demands and allowed the contract to expire at the end of the year. The parties struck a new contract in August which included an agreement to allow regular, independent inspections of Nike supplier factories.
A university news release announcing the new contract in August does not mention GSC, the sit-in or student activism. One line in the eighth paragraph of the release notes the university “engaged with faculty and student leaders” while negotiating the contract.
Ryan said the framing of the university’s statement disregards the pivotal role of student activists in pressuring the university to negotiate the new contract.
“What troubles me is that, as usual, there is no mention of the extensive efforts that students put into pushing Georgetown into a decision,” Ryan wrote in an email to The Hoya. “While I can’t speak for all students or student activists on campus, I don’t think we do it for the glamor or for the recognition by university administrators but I think it erases the work done by students, in the case of GU F.R.E.E., it was work done in large part by queer students and students of color.”
Ryan said the way the university represents student activism is important for reasons other than conferring credit.
“The stories we tell about victories and failures are important and it can be hard to tell stories about student activism when the activists are left out of the narrative,” Ryan wrote. “I knew when the statement was released about private prisons that it had taken time and effort on the part of a committed group of students, but I know that so many students don’t know, and that can be detrimental to promoting a culture in which students can engage in activism.”
As for the future, Abdelfadeel noted the work of divestment advocates is unfinished. The original group’s 2016 proposal to the CISR was more broad than the one enacted by the board of directors this month, also including a request for divestment from companies invested in private prisons, rather than only private prisons themselves.
“The original proposal to the CISR proposed divestment from private prisons and the wider industry that sustains it,” Abdelfadeel said. “It would be great to see a commitment from the university regarding the wider private prison industry.”
The proposal also called on the university to divest from any companies that benefitted financially from the Israeli occupation of Palestine, a request that was rejected by the CISR.
Abdelfaleel said there are common threads in the social implications of private prisons and the occupation.
“We found common themes of state violence — black people living and dying under the United States’ white supremacy and Palestinians living and dying under Israeli settler colonialism and apartheid. Moreover, there is an overlap in companies that empower the private prison industry and the illegal occupation,” Abdelfaleel said.
GU F.R.E.E. also continues to call for greater transparency in Georgetown’s investment records and promotes general public consciousness of the university’s investment policies.
Morris, meanwhile, said he hoped that this decision would prompt the university to look at other instances of state violence and adapt its investment policies accordingly.
“I hope there is something sustaining from the divestment of prisons, not like, ‘OK, we did it; it’s done,’” Morris said. “This should only be the beginning of Georgetown’s broader divestment movement.”

Matthew 6: “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others.”
This article is ridiculous and only confirms the fears of those on the right that the only thing leftists or those seeking social justice really want is self-righteousness and recognition. To make things worse, somehow this, of all matters, made the front page. What a superfluous complaint.

A divisive, us-versus-them approach to debating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict impedes progress, argued pro-Israel activist Chloé Valdary at a Nov. 28 discussion.
The U.S. conversation regarding the conflict, a decadeslong struggle between Israelis and Palestinians over the two sides’ competing claims to lands controlled by Israel, pits proponents of Israeli security and self-determination against advocates for the rights of Palestinians.
Valdary, who works as director of partnerships and a Shillman Fellow at the educational film production company Jerusalem U, said an oppressor-versus-oppressed framing misrepresents the conflict.
In an oppressor-versus-oppressed mindset, Valdary said, morality only supports victims. She said Americans who supported Zionism out of a shared sense of oppression or intersectionality could no longer view Israel as relatable or even “moral” once it won statehood.
“If you see history through this very narrow framework, anything that falls out of these boxes, you can no longer fight for, you can no longer stand for. It’s a worldview, in my opinion, that doesn’t allow for complexity,” Valdary said. “Instead of having that paradigm, why don’t we just empower everyone?”
She criticized the concept of intersectionality for reinforcing categorical labels of the “us-versus-them” binary.
“Intersectionality is responding to categorization, but it is not, in my mind, challenging the categories,” Valdary said. “It is reinforcing the categories, in a sense, because it is making claims that I, as a person of color, have most assuredly experienced ‘x’ at the hands of someone who was white by virtue of being in the categories, in the skin colors that we have.”
Instead of intersectionality, Valdary proposed restorative justice, or repairing harm caused by misdeeds, and her “theory of enchantment,” which is the promotion of constructive discussions about differences to build compassion for a common humanity, as alternative paradigms through which to understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Valdary said she hopes to transcend the “us-versus-them binary” through this approach.
“Restorative justice tries to transcend that [us-versus-them] and ask the question, ‘How can we heal both of our communities?’ That is something I’m very much attracted to,” Valdary said.
If Israelis and Palestinians could stop seeing their losses as the other group’s gains, they could move toward healing, Valdary said.
Georgetown Israel Alliance President Sean Lerner (SFS ’20) and Vice President Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20) organized the event, hosted by the GIA and the Georgetown University Lecture Fund, to bridge what Lerner called a “racialized” divide in the Israeli-Palestinian discussion on campus.
“I’ve known about Chloé for a while. She’s pretty popular in the young pro-Israel world, especially on social media,” Lerner said. “We also recognized that there was a sort of element around the discussion of Israel-Palestine on this campus that was racialized in a way; there was a divide in the community.”
Valdary encouraged students to analyze the dilemmas Israelis and Palestinians face while recognizing that some of them are currently irreconcilable and to engage with organizations that bring together contrasting perspectives.
“We, as students and educators, need to volunteer for those organizations, seek out those organizations that are bringing Israelis and Palestinians together and creating dialogue,” Valdary said. “Dialogue that might not have all the answers, but… is much more interested in saying, ‘Even though you and I disagree about x, y and z, our goal is to foster compassion and empathy in the midst of profound disagreement.’”
Ultimately, Valdary said she hopes to redefine how people conceptualize the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
“We are so much more than these weird, objectified terminologies. I think we have to enter the conversation with the desire to lean in toward the other, so that we can see ourselves in them and see them in ourselves,” Valdary said.

What a wonderful oncept. Unfortunately, given the tribal stone-age mentality of one of the parties, it won’t work. The idea depends on an assumption of reasonableness by both parties to the conflict. History has shown time and again (we have such a penchant for ignoring the lessons of history) that one of the parties will enter the dialogue with a hidden agenda that assumes any ‘give’ by the other side is a sign of weakness (difficult to accept that an inhuman society that glorifies martyrdom and terrorism can be reasonable) and fall right back into the original paradigm of tribal conflict.

This article is shallow and makes the situation in the Middle East sound so complex and conveys a purely emotional and unrealistic “lets understand each other over coffee” solution, while using such interstesting terms that sound so sophisticated, educated, and knowledgeable. Do people just make up words today?
 First, this is not about “Israelis & Palistinians”, but “muslims vs Jews”. Its that simple. For over 6 years I have lived in Israel as  non-Jewish independent journalist and travelled the details of the country, know the the history,  been on the front lines of war, infiltrated terror groups, and having shown first hand via interviews that young and old muslims, in and out of Israel, openly call for the destruction of the Jewish State. Might I also add that these everyday muslims are not islamic leadership or part of a militant group like hamas or hezbollah.
Most Isrseli’s, especially Israeli born Jews, clearly understand the intent of their islamic enemies desire to destroy them from the river to the sea and historically speaking whenever there was a CALL for peace it was simply a muslim moment to build up to the next attack on the Jews. Whenever there was a treaty signed and historically owned Jewish land was given away it would be used as a platform for miltant activity to attack Israel.
Hamas and Hezbollah hold no countries/people hostage. No military exists without the support of the civilain population. muslims encourage, cheer, and groom their children to join these 2 groups for the sake of allah as directed by the koran. As well, if not to join militant islam openly, but to act independtly to bring glory to the prophet and further global domination.
I would venture to say, with great assurance, that the people involved in the article speak ONLY from a Western perspective and know nothing of islam, the koran, the intimate details of the culture, language, history, and mentality of the players involved. I do appreciate and respect advocacy for Israel, but when one continues to use “fake terms” that promote the lie of “palistinians”, when you have never attend the funeral of soldiers, or sat with vicitms of terror for 6 years then you bring nothing to the table realistically as far as a solution

Chloe knows the history and reality and I admire her efforts, but as the others have stated: there are no 2 parties with a happy outcome.  As long as the Jews violate the dhimma and refuse to die or return to subjugated dhimmi status, muslims will wage war.  The muslims will not mind dying (unless they did not succeed in killing Jews along the way) and the Pentagon/EU backed leaders of the muslims reward the killers of Jews.
Western and European leaders have full power to defund and destroy both hamas and fatah, but deliberately choose not to.
These basic facts render the kumbaya efforts at harmony and peace a waste of time.

Georgetown University’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine hosted its annual Israel Apartheid Week from April 2 to 6 to draw attention to the 70 years of Palestinian popular resistance against the continued “process of dispossession” and conflict in the Israel-Palestine region since the 1948 Israeli War of Independence.
In its 14th year, Israel Apartheid Week is an international movement on college campuses that aims to provide a platform for events in cities to raise awareness of “Israel’s apartheid system over the Palestinian people and to build support for the growing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement,” according to the IAW website. The Palestinian-led BDS movement calls for international companies and governments to withdraw support for, divest from and sanction Israeli companies “that are involved in the violation of Palestinian human rights,” according to the BDS movement website.
Andrew Kadi, a BDS movement leader, was invited to explain the BDS movement to students April 3. BDS encourages the international community to stop “a regime of settler colonialism, apartheid and occupation” by exerting financial pressure on Israel, according to the BDS website.
Part of a nationwide federation of Palestinian advocacy groups, Georgetown’s SJP organized events to support the ongoing dialogue about self-determination of Palestinian people.
Other events SJP hosted throughout the week included a film screening of “The Wanted 18,” an animated documentary about the efforts of Palestinians to start a small local dairy industry, and a talk by Georgetown department of anthropology professor Laurie King, who discussed the importance of Palestinian media and journalism. King co-founded a Palestine-focused, online news source called the Electronic Intifada in 2001. SJP also tabled and wrote letters to Palestinian political prisoners in Red Square.
SJP President Ahmad Al-Husseini (NHS ’20) said Israel Apartheid Week, which has taken place on Georgetown’s campus since 2011, is SJP’s number one priority for the year.
 
“Our goal in doing this week is simply just raising awareness and reminding the world that this struggle still exists and is not going away until immediate and severe action is taken to hold Israel accountable,” Al-Husseini wrote in an email to The Hoya.
This year’s SJP’s Israeli Apartheid Week did not occur without incident. A Palestinian flag, hung in Red Square on April 1, was taken down April 3 and April 6 by unknown individuals. This resulted in SJP filing two bias incident reports with the university administration.
Georgetown Israel Alliance (GIA) also reported five separate incidents concerning its Israeli flag, which also hung in Red Square. Its flag was removed April 3, 4 and 6, and GIA filed bias reports with the administration. Georgetown University Police Department apprehended the April 6 perpetrator.
SJP Treasurer Olivia Vita (COL ’19) said recent conflicts on the border between Gaza Strip and Israel have added significance to on-campus events.
“This year we didn’t have a particular theme, but the current happenings in Gaza have added another layer of heartfelt sensitivity,” Vita wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians protested along the Gaza Strip on March 30 against Israel’s Gaza Blockade — a land, air, and sea blockade on the Gaza Strip by Israel and Egypt from 2007 to present — according to The New York Times.
The protests, which involved around 30,000 people, aimed to stage a peaceful sit-in for six weeks before protesters were met with Israeli military force. Gazan health ministry officials said 29 Palestinians have been killed in an escalation of violence between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protestors, with thousands more wounded, including 293 by live fire. The UN Human Rights office said it has indications that Israeli forces used “excessive force” during last week’s crackdown, according to The Independent.
GIA, a club dedicated to Israel’s right to exist as a state, disputes SJP’s definition of the nature of Israel Apartheid Week. Despite individual friendships between some members of GIA and SJP, tensions rise between the two groups every year during Israel Apartheid Week, according to GIA Cultural Chair Andrew Boas (SFS ’20).
“Around Israel Apartheid Week, it obviously gets very tense,” Boas wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I think for better or for worse, SJP has not been particularly active this year. They come out sort of during Israel Apartheid Week. But as far as it relates to Israel or Palestine, there’s very little cooperation between the groups.”
A main source of tension between the groups has arisen over the meaning of “apartheid” in the week’s title.
Al-Husseini said the use of “apartheid” in the campaign is meant to represent SJP’s view of the relationship between the Israeli government and Palestinians.
“We use the word apartheid in this week’s title because we truly do believe that the current policies carried out by Israeli government represent a system that treat Palestinians like second-class citizens in all aspects of life,” Al-Husseini wrote.
GIA President Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20), who is also a current member of The Hoya’s editorial board, pushed back on the label apartheid as a false characterization of Israel’s political climate.
“If ‘apartheid’ is meant literally, apartheid has a legal definition whose criteria are not met by the situation in Israel. If it is meant metaphorically, then Israel is nothing like apartheid South Africa,” Larkin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Arab Israelis, unlike non-white South Africans, enjoy the same privileges and rights as Jewish Israelis and are integral members of Israel’s political, economic, and cultural life. They live and work alongside non-Arab Israelis, sit in the Israeli parliament, and serve bravely in the Israel Defense Forces at ever-higher rates.”
GIA plans to host Georgetown’s first-ever Israel Peace Week from April 13 to 19, though its week’s purpose is not to rebut Israel Apartheid Week, Larkin said.
“I hope that Israel Peace Week will be a chance for Georgetown students to do their part to move us closer to the vision that many of individuals in both GIA and SJP share, of two states, one Jewish and one Arab, living side-by-side in peace, cooperation, and mutual respect,” Larkin wrote.
Next week, SJP plans to set up a mock apartheid wall in the Intercultural Center Galleria to showcase ongoing instances of “human rights violations conducted by Israel,” Al-Husseini said. Two years ago, the wall was vandalized with anti-Palestinian messages.
A final Israel Apartheid Week event, a charity dinner to benefit a humanitarian aid organization Helping Hand, has not yet been scheduled. SJP may postpone the dinner until next semester because of logistical and scheduling issues, according to Al-Husseini.

It would be difficult to find anything remotely accurate in this unintentionally-hilarious, Orwellian-rewriting of history masquerading as an anti-Israel editorial, but I will restrict myself to the following points:
The myth of Arab Muslim victimhood is cheap propaganda stemming from the failed Arab attempts to destroy Israel and throw its Jewish population “into the sea.”
The anti-Israel left continues to pander to the irrational, bigoted demands of the Middle East’s Arab Muslim majority to suppress the region’s only non-muslim state in favor of yet another Arab Muslim country. That blatant disregard for the rights of anyone who is not an Arab Muslim is precisely the reason why the Jews of Israel had to fight for national independence.
The mere existence of Israel proclaims the national rights of the Jewish INDIGENOUS population of Israel; a country and a people that predate Arab colonialism and will outlive it as well.

An Israeli flag and a Palestinian flag, both hung in Red Square as part of pro-Palestine group Students for Justice in Palestine’s Israel Apartheid Week, were removed multiple times between April 3 and April 8, culminating in the Georgetown University Police Department apprehending one of the perpetrators who stole the Israeli flag.
GUPD concluded their investigation of the incidents, according to Matt Hill, the university’s media relations manager.
“GUPD has concluded investigations of all incidents reported to GUPD and made appropriate referrals to Student Conduct. The university also received bias-related incident reports which are being reviewed by the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity & Affirmative Action accordingly. We encourage anyone with information about these incidents to contact GUPD at 202-687-4343 or via LiveSafe. GUPD will increase foot patrol and surveillance in areas with planned activity,”” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Israel Apartheid Week is an annual protest on college campuses that aims to raise awareness of the continued Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
A Palestinian flag, hung in Red Square on April 1, was taken down once on April 3 and again on April 6 by unknown individuals, resulting in SJP filing two bias-related incident reports with the university. Members of both SJP and the Georgetown Israel Alliance have called on the university to take a stronger stance on incidents that infringe on the rights of student groups to demonstrate in Red Square.
GIA has filed five incident reports with GUPD regarding the theft of the Israeli flag. GIA President Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20), who is also a member of The Hoya’s editorial board, said the Israeli flag was taken down on five separate occasions on April 3, April 4, April 6 and twice on April 8.
GIA Cultural Chair Andrew Boas (SFS ’20), who witnessed the most recent theft of the Israeli flag, said GUPD may classify the thefts as bias-related incidents through the Division of Student Affairs as GUPD pushes for punishment for the suspect.
GUPD has not identified a suspect for the theft of the Palestinian flag, according to SJP Treasurer Olivia Vita (COL ’19).
GUPD did not respond to The Hoya’s request for comment on Boas’ and Vita’s statements as of 1:30 a.m.
SJP President Ahmad Al-Husseini (NHS ’20) and Vita both said the Georgetown Program Board removed both flags to post their flyers for its April 6 spring concert, featuring rapper Waka Flocka Flame.
After the Palestinian flag was hung once more in another location in Red Square, it was torn down along with Israel Apartheid Week fact sheets, according to Al-Husseini.
Al-Husseini said SJP chose to hang the Palestinian flag in a display of solidarity with those injured and killed in recent protests on Gaza’s border with Israel and as part of SJP’s Israel Apartheid Week, which is organized to draw attention to the 70 years of Palestinian popular resistance against the continued conflict in the Israel-Palestine region since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.
“We hung the Palestinian flag on Sunday out of solidarity and support for that weekend’s events in Gaza,” Al-Husseini wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians protested along the Gaza Strip on March 30 against Israel’s and Egypt’s continued blockade of Gaza since 2007, according to the New York Times.
The protests, which involved around 30,000 people, aimed to stage a peaceful sit-in for six weeks before protesters were met with Israeli military force. Health ministry officials from Gaza said 34 Palestinians had been killed in an escalation of violence between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian protestors, with thousands more wounded, including 293 by live fire, according to Al-Jazeera.
The United Nations Human Rights Council said it has evidence that Israeli forces used “excessive force” during last week’s crackdown, according to The Independent.
Anti-Palestinian sentiments were posted on the wall near the Palestinian flag and on social media shortly after the Palestinian flag went up, Al-Husseini said.
“Less than two hours later, the GIA put up an Israel flag right next to it with individuals responsible for this writing captions such as ‘clap back season’ and other disrespectful captions on social media,” Al-Husseini wrote.
The Georgetown Israel Alliance hung the Israeli flag beside the Palestinian flag to protest the Israel Apartheid Week, according to Boas.
“GIA put up the Israeli flag in response to Israel Apartheid Week, a week-long series of events planned by SJP with the purpose of denying Israel’s right to exist,” Boas wrote. “We feel that the Israeli flag, along with our banner advocating for two-sided dialogue, was a good way to remind Georgetown that we too are on campus and are always willing to dialogue.”
GIA is a pro-Israel group that supports bilateral dialogue and believes in Israel’s right to exist. Boas said that Israel Apartheid Week is a clear denial of Israel’s right to exist.
“The issue with Israel Apartheid Week is that it’s an absolute one-sided denial of Israel’s right to exist,” Boas wrote. “Students For Justice in Palestine goes to great lengths to explain that it is actually about Palestine and not Israel. It’s not an attack on Israel; it’s a protection of Palestine, when in reality we can tell, even by the name of the event Israel Apartheid Week, that it’s an attack on Israel that has no basis on history or reality.”
Vita said there are instances of personal harassment and other anti-Palestinian acts such as theft of Palestinian flags every year.
Boas said GIA has also faced harassment in the past. Boas referenced an incident in March last year when signs with American support for the existence of Israel were defaced.
“They were just pro-Israel messages of peace and coexistence. They were flyers that had been distributed and torn down and also things were written on them that were offensive,” Boas said.
Al-Husseini called on the university to take a stronger stance against the thefts of the Israeli and Palestinian flags, asking them to release a statement condemning the actions.
“These events have become far too common place and do not attract enough attention, as it goes directly against Georgetown’s free speech rights,” Al-Husseini wrote. “Red Square is such a cherished space because it is central to our campus’s idea of promoting free speech and I hate to see these type of vandalism on all sides, so I hope to see the campus issue a formal response to these far too common-place incidents.”
Boas also called for a statement from the university in response to the thefts.
“The university absolutely should issue a statement saying that discrimination or crimes on the basis of national identity, in this case Israeli identity, are obviously condemned by the university and unacceptable in much the same way that they did a statement when swastikas were drawn in LXR,” Boas said.
Hill said Georgetown remains committed to tolerance and the administration supports free speech on campus.
“As a Catholic and Jesuit university, Georgetown is an inclusive community that supports the free and open exchange of ideas and welcomes people of all faiths and racial and ethnic backgrounds. Georgetown does not tolerate actions, including theft or vandalism, that attempt to silence the speech of our community,” Hill wrote in an email to The Hoya.

April 13, 2018 at 2:15 am
It seems a bit odd for this news story to allow anyone from SJP to comment on  GIA’s assertion that Georgetown SJP doesn’t accept Israel’s right to exist. GIA would have us believe that criticizing Israeli policy is ultimately about denying the right of Israel to exist full stop. If Al-Husseini or Vita actually believe that, let’s hear it. A return to 1967 lines is not denying Israel’s right to exist. Demanding political and economic freedom for Palestinians is not demanding that Israel be pushed into the sea.

The creation of two distinct nation-states is the most effective solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, said former Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni at an event hosted April 13 by the Georgetown Israel Alliance.
Livni, who served as Minister of Justice of Israel from 2013 to 2014 and was the chief negotiator for Israel in 2014 peace talks with Palestinians, hopes to re-initiate negotiations with Palestinians and cooperate to create a two-state solution.
Ambassador and Georgetown professor Dennis Ross moderated the event. The event was co-sponsored by the School of Foreign Service, the Georgetown Israel Alliance, the International Relations Club, the College Democrats and the Institute for Politics and Public Service.
Livni is also the current leader and founder of Israel’s Hatnuah Party, a liberal party formed to offer a non-socialist alternative party to voters frustrated by the stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, according to the Hatnuah website.
The creation of two distinct states is not just to end conflict between Israel and Palestine, but also to enable Israeli and Palestinian citizens to each have their own spaces, Livni said.
“The whole idea is not just to create another state in the Middle East,” Livni said. “The whole idea is to end the conflict on the basis of two states for two peoples, so that each state [provides a space] for different peoples.”
Livni also pushed back on criticisms she has received from Israeli citizens about the potential for compromise, which some view as a sign that they are losing land to the Palestinians.
“The idea of giving the territory to Palestinians is perceived as being too weak, giving the Palestinians,” Livni said. “When I preach for two states for two peoples, I am thinking about Israel as a Jewish democratic state, but I’m being blamed that I’m thinking about the Palestinians. My answer is that I want to find a way to divorce the Palestinians, not to get married to them.”
Livni discussed past proposals for a two-state solution that attempted to end conflict, including the Clinton Parameters, a proposal authored by Ross in 2000 that offered Palestinian leadership a five-pronged solution to try to quell the conflict. The proposal included the creation of an autonomous Palestinian state, wherein Israel would maintain control over everything outside of Gaza and the West Bank and Palestine would agree to accept any refugees who wished to settle in the territory.
Ultimately, the Clinton Parameters agreement stalled and was never implemented.
Livni views the two-state solution as the best way to end the conflict and address ongoing refugee crises within the region.
“The Palestinian state should be the full, complete answer to the desperation of the Palestinians, whoever they may be, those who live in the territories and those who live in refugee camps,” Livni said.
Cooperation will be key in achieving Livni’s hope for a Jewish democratic state, she said.
“On the way, I need to stop at certain stations and reach an agreement with Palestinians, because in order to have Israel as the Jewish democratic state and be the Jewish majority, I cannot give the entire land,” Livni said. “I need to separate from the Palestinians to reach an agreement.”
Ultimately, Livni concluded that she will be content if negotiations between Israel and Palestine can be achieved or if there is greater security in Israel.
“Hopefully, in the end, one of two things will happen,” Livni said. “We will find a party to reach an agreement with, or we will keep Israel’s security, and we will call the settlers living outside the fence to come to Israel and to focus on the vision of Zionism the way I understand it.”

The two-state solution is a textbook example of cognitive dissonance on a grand political scale. 
With regards to the plausibility of the two-state solution, like the Holy Roman Empire, the two-state solution did not solve anything and it wasn’t in the business of creating two states.  Not unless you count a Hamas state in Gaza and a Fatah state in the West Bank.   
Rather, the two-state solution was a perverse euphemism for carving an Islamic terror state out of the land of Israel and the living flesh of her people.   It solved nothing except the shortage of graves in Israel and Muslim terrorists in the Middle East.
In hindsight, the consequences of giving terrorists a country to play with were always about as predictable as running a toaster in the shower.

Georgetown Israel Alliance’s inaugural Israel Peace Week began on April 13, consisting of five events aimed at fostering meaningful conversations about a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The weeklong event began with a discussionwith former Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice Tzipi Livinilast Friday.A vigil to commemorate Yom Hazikaron, a day of remembrance for fallen soldiers and victims of terrorism, was held on Wednesday.
GIA also hosted Uri Keidar, executive director of Israel Hofsheet, a grassroots movement that advocates for civil rights, Wednesday. The week culminated with a celebration of Israel’s 70th anniversary of independence, “Israel Day,” on Thursday, April 19.
The week was dedicated to understanding steps that Israel has taken to achieve peace with Palestine and to explore plans for reconciliation, according to GIA President Tanner Larkin (SFS ’20), who hopes to encourage meaningful conversations about potential solutions for peace (Full disclosure: Larkin is also a member of The Hoya’s Editorial Board).
“We launched Israel Peace Week because we want to change the conversation about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and get people talking about peaceful, win-win solutions to the conflict,” Larkin wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Too often, the conflict is approached in terms of a zero-sum game, and we’ve seen campaigns that are more about tearing down one side than building anything constructive.”
GIA cultural chair Andrew Boas (SFS ’20) said the student group has tried to provide an immersive opportunity for Georgetown students who have ties with Israeli culture throughout the week.
GIA invited Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine to participate in the events of Israel Peace Week, according to Boas and Larkin.
SJP President Ahmad Al-Husseini (NHS ’20) said that SJP plans to protest the celebration of Israel Day, which is known to Palestinians as the Nakba, or “catastrophe,” in Arabic.
“SJP’s only involvement in this week’s events will be protesting their disgusting celebration of the 70th year anniversary of the Nakba, which forced out 700,000 Palestinian natives from their homeland as the human price for creating the state of Israel,” Al-Husseini wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Larkin said that Israel Peace Week neither presents a one-sided version of the conflict nor ignores the suffering of Palestinians, despite criticism of the event.
“I understand why someone might think that, but if they were to come to an IPW event, they would see that was not remotely the case,” Larkin wrote.
SJP treasurer Olivia Vita (COL ’19) expressed doubt about the effectiveness of pursuing dialogue about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, noting that tangible changes are likely the only way to forge peace .
“We don’t need words, we need systemic change,” Vita wrote in an email to The Hoya.
Israel Peace Week does not effectively address the problems faced by people of color in Israel, according to Vita, as she believes they are not culturally relevant.
“As a black Jewish young woman with family in Israel, when I think of peace and Israel I think of the ongoing African refugee crisis, recent state violence in Gaza and day-to-day lack of accessibility of resources to people of color in Israel, Jewish and non-Jewish,” Vita wrote. “The events are neither relevant to current events nor reflective of the ever-diversifying population of Israel and Palestine.”
Israel Peace Week aims to present the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a multifaceted topic with speakers who advocated for a solution that would benefit both Palestinians and Israelis, according to Larkin.
“One consistent motif throughout IPW has been to showcase the complex, multi-dimensional character of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,” Larkin wrote. “That’s why we hosted Tzipi Livni and co-hosted Nadav Tamir with J Street U Georgetown, both of them repeatedly stressed the need for reconciliation between Palestinians and Israelis and the need for a Palestinian state in order to fulfill Palestinian national aspirations in their own space.”
Larkin said that Israel Peace Week is a positive way for Jewish students to finish the school year, especially after the start of the school year, when swastikas were found painted inside an LXR hallway during Rosh Hashana, he said.
“In a school year that started off with swastikas, Israel Day will end things on a high note,” Larkin said.

Being progressive and being pro-Israel are not mutually exclusive, but compatible, Congressman Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) said at an event Tuesday.
Deutch, the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, discussed the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship and potential solutions for the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Deutch has frequently travelled to Israel and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
The event, cohosted by the Georgetown Israel Alliance, Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and Georgetown University College Democrats, included a conversation with Deutch moderated by President of GIA Ben Goodman (SFS ’20), who is also a Hoya Staff Writer.
Deutch describes himself as a “passionate supporter of Israel,” according to his official website. In September, Deutch and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) introduced legislation that authorizes new collaboration between the U.S. and Israel on issues related to humanitarian projects, drones and outer space.
Israel is losing the support of Democratic American voters, according to a New York Times Magazine article published March 2015. Netanyahu has turned to Deutch to find support, according to the article.
His Democratic values and progressive outlook do not conflict with his support for Israel, Deutch said.
“I am a progressive and argue that my support for Israel is not something that I need to fit with my progressive views; rather it is entirely consistent with those views,” Deutch said.
Deutch’s belief in a two-state solution, which would mean the creation of two distinct nation-states between Israel and Palestine, reinforces his progressive politics, he said.
“In order for there to be peace, we try to ensure that the facts on the ground don’t preclude the possibility of getting to a two state solution,” Deutch said.
In a news release on his official website published Sept. 12, Deutch said that the United States must support Israel in its national security endeavors.
“Israel is under constant threat from every direction. A threat to Israel, our strategic ally in a turbulent region, is also a threat to our national security,” Deutch said in a press release about the bill. “Enhancing Israel’s security is a step toward strengthening our own national security,” he said.
Members of Congress sometimes use the U.S. policy toward Israel as a political bargaining chip because the topic has turned partisan, Deutch said.
“In my own party there are some democrats who have challenges with Trump, and so it gets to be challenging if people start to equate support for Israel as something President Trump has,” Deutch said. “It’s important to always remember the relationship has always been bipartisan and that’s why it has been so successful.”
Deutch said that both sides of the political spectrum support the U.S.-Israel relationship and engage with Israel.
“Giving my colleagues the chance to hear from different political officials in Israel helps people understand when we talk about shared values, its more than just belief in equality and human rights, but it actually focuses on the free exchange of ideas,” Deutch said.
According to Deutch, debates about U.S. policy toward Israel lead to broadened bipartisan discussions.
“It’s a chance to start with the discussion of the U.S.-Israel relationship and sometimes broaden to other discussions,” Deutch said.
Deutch first got involved with the Israeli community as an undergraduate and law student at the University of Michigan and has developed a fuller appreciation for the issues that Israel encounters since becoming a Congressman, he said.
“There’s still that same passion about the country and the change I’ve seen over the past number of decades, but a more sophisticated understanding of the challenges now,” Deutch said on Tuesday.
The event was successful because it brought in an audience with varying levels of knowledge and opinions, Goodman said in an interview with The Hoya.
“As the Georgetown Israel Alliance, we run the gambit from knowing and caring a lot about Israel to not knowing much at all,” Goodman said. “The event was a big success for us as an organization in that such a variety of people were able to come and make their voices heard and hear from Congressman Deutch.”

Georgetown University’s chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine erected an artistic representation of the 400 mile wall in the West Bank on campus as part of its 15th annual Israeli Apartheid Week to raise awareness about the Israeli state policies against Palestinian citizens.
Israeli Apartheid Week, which began April 1, is an international campaign across college campuses that strives to raise public support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. This year’s theme is “Stop Arming Colonialism.” Over 200 cities worldwide participate in IAW, according to its website.
The Palestinian-led BDS movement encourages the boycott of and divestment from Israeli businesses, cultural and academic institutions, and sanctions on the Israeli government. 
Georgetown’s SJP hosted events throughout the week to support the BDS movement and raise awareness of the plight of Palestinians in Israel, according to SJP. 
“We hope students understand how Israel’s separation wall, occupation of the West Bank, and illegal settlements therein are a manifestation of apartheid,” SJP wrote in a statement to The Hoya. “These policies have divided families, expropriated land, and violated the civil liberties and human rights of Palestinians.”
Israel built a 400-mile wall intended to bolster security along the West Bank in 2002 during the Second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, after a series of attacks killed 130 Israelis, according to The New York Times. With the violence along the West Bank having declined, the wall violates international law and the rights of self-determination, according to a 2004 advisory opinion of the International Criminal Court.
Students gathered to create a mock wall of art Monday, April 1, and it has been displayed in the Intercultural Center Galleria throughout the week. The construction aimed to represent the Israel barrier in the West Bank, according to SJP president Ahmad Al-Husseini (NHS ’20).
SJP hosted Former Syrian Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs, Abdallah Al Dardari, on Tuesday, who spoke on the historical context of the Palestinian occupation and its impact on Syria, according to Al-Husseini. 
“He came and spoke about the occupation in Golan Heights and the relationship between Syria and Palestine and the intrinsic special bond that is there,” Al-Husseini said.
The event follows President Trump’s recent official acknowledgment of Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a region controlled by Syria until 1967. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, a move recognized by no other country until Trump’s announcement on March 21, according to The Washington Post. The United States is now the only state to officially recognize Israeli authority over this contested region.
SJP also held a panel Wednesday about the BDS movement, which featured speakers that included BDS leader Andrew Kadi and SJP activist Moath Elhady.
The international community has the responsibility to ensure the rights of Palestinians are protected, Kadi said at an event held by the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs in May 2018. 
“To me, BDS is a movement that is more about the international community. It’s a solidarity movement in the sense that we’re the ones who are complicit,” Kadi said. 
SJP hosted a charity dinner Thursday in McShain Lounge to raise money for Helping Hand for Relief and Development, an emergency and humanitarian aid organization, according to the HHRD website. At the dinner, students read poetry and celebrated Palestinian culture. 
The events of the week show the power of student organizing and collective action, Sonya Fares (COL ’22), an attendee of the charity dinner, said. 
“The topic is a highly contentious one that raises much debate, but I think any instance where students come together to share their perspective and spread their message is really great to see,” Fares said. 
The philanthropic dinner was an opportunity to celebrate Palestinian culture, according to Munir Pavez (SFS ’20), co-president of Georgetown University Arab Society, who performed at the event. 
“I’m glad SJP this year was able to hold a philanthropic event that focused on Palestinian culture, art, and solidarity,” Pavez wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I helped lead dabke, a traditional Levantine line dance that, for Palestinians, has symbolized cooperation, determination and love for their heritage.” 
The IAW does not encourage dialogue and only tells one side of the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the Georgetown Israel Alliance wrote in an April 2 statement on Facebook.
“We are disappointed that this week’s events discourage dialogue and reject the Jewish connection to Israel in favor of a divisive, one-sided narrative,” GIA wrote. “To further our goal of dialogue, we will be tabling this week in Red Square so that members of the Georgetown community can engage with us on their views.”
Some of the week’s events have led to misunderstandings of SJP’s mission, according to Tara Nouri (SFS ’22), an SJP board member.
“We’ve had a lot of great interactions over this past week and a lot of bad interactions where people have not quite understood what our mission is here,” Nouri said. “We are interested in the uplifting of the Palestinian people for their equal treatment in the occupied territories.”
To conclude IAW, SJP will host a screening of the documentary “The Lobby,” which is about the influence of the Israel lobby in U.S. politics, on Friday.
Last year during IAW, a Palestinian flag hung in Red Square on April 1 was removed by unknown individuals April 3 and April 6. SJP filed two bias incident reports with university administration. 
GIA also reported five separate incidents regarding its Israeli flag, which was also hung in Red Square, during last year’s IAW. GIA filed bias reports with the administration after the Israeli flag was removed April 3, 4 and 6. The individual who removed the Israeli flag April 6 was apprehended by the Georgetown University Police Department.
This article was updated April 5 to correct the incidents of flag removal which occurred during IAW last year.

Republicans and Democrats should work together to ensure the United States and Israel maintain a mutually beneficial relationship to benefit the future success of both countries, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) said at a Nov. 20 event.
At the event “Rep. Gottheimer: The Democrats and the US-Israel Relationship,” Gottheimer discussed the current state of affairs between the United States and Israel regarding each nation’s economy and national security. Georgetown University College Democrats and Georgetown Israel Alliance co-sponsored the Wednesday event. 
Gottheimer serves as co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan coalition that seeks to address congressional dilemmas. He also co-sponsored the U.S.-Israel Cooperation Enhancement and Regional Security Act in July, which authorizes joint research and cooperation programs between the U.S. and Israel. 
Israel has long been a U.S. ally in the Middle East since the United States was the first nation to recognize Israel as a state in 1948 and Jerusalem as its capital in 2017. Remaining allies are necessary for regional protection and the international economy in both countries, according to Gottheimer.
“This relationship is essential to our national security and important to the region,” Gottheimer said. “Part of what is so important in the U.S.-Israel relationship is the economic relationship.”
From a U.S. political perspective, Republicans and Democrats should collaborate to develop policies that effectively navigate the U.S.-Israeli relationship, according to Gottheimer.
“The U.S.-Israeli relationship has always been a bipartisan issue and we must make sure this remains bipartisan,” Gottheimer said. 
The event comes after Israeli and Islamist forces on the Gaza Strip agreed to a tentative ceasefire Nov. 14 after two days of fighting between the groups. This ceasefire was threatened two days later, however, as Hamas, a Palestinian political and militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, launched two missiles into Israeli territory that were struck down by Israeli Air Defense systems, according to The Washington Post.
Certain news outlets have mischaracterized the nature of recent violence between Israel and Hamas, according to Gottheimer. 
“I think the media, depending on the outlet, are portraying this as an attack on the Palestinian side and forgetting that Israel is responding and not being proactive in their use of force,” Gottheimer said. 
Gottheimer also addressed the recent prevalence of antisemitism across the United States. Gottheimer has witnessed antisemitic hate crimes in schools in his district and while campaigning for his House seat, he said. 
“In only the last few months, we have had six swastikas found in middle schools,” Gottheimer said. “I’m used to swastikas on my campaign signs and have faced comments questioning my loyalty to the USA as a Jew.”
After President Donald Trump’s inauguration in 2017, hate crimes targeting Jews and Jewish institutions rose 37% in the United States. Several antisemitic events occurred at Georgetown in 2017, including antisemitic graffiti discovered near Makóm, the Jewish prayer space, and swastikas spray-painted in LXR Hall during Rosh Hashana the same year.
The growing trend of antisemitic sentiment in the United States has been exacerbated by social media, according to Gottheimer. 
“A simmering cauldron of anger has been unleashed because people feel they can say whatever they want and hide behind social media like cowards,” Gottheimer said. 
In a recent development in U.S.-Israeli foreign policy, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Nov. 18 that Trump’s administration determined Israeli settlements in the West Bank do not violate international law. More than 700,000 settlers reside in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, both of which are in regions claimed by Palestine. The announcement breaks with decades of preceding U.S. foreign policy, according to The Washington Post.
After Gottheimer addressed Georgetown community members, Maurice Zekaria (SFS ’21), a leader of the Georgetown Israel Alliance, led a question and answer period. A productive and impactful conversation came out of the event, according to Zekaria.
“I think it was a great event and a lot of people came out with diverse opinions,” Zekaria said in an interview with The Hoya. “It was a great exchange of ideas.” 
The event exemplified Georgetown student interest in the U.S.-Israeli relationship, Gottheimer said in an interview with The Hoya.
“There was a room full of very thoughtful students who asked many poignant questions,” Gottheimer said. “I am looking forward to coming back to Georgetown to address U.S. and Israel related issues.”

Miko Peled, a Jewish pro-Palestinian writer and activist who has been accused of posting antisemitic tweets, spoke at an event Sunday despite widespread condemnation from students and campus organizations.
Peled’s invitation to speak virtually at Georgetown University provoked backlash, resulting in a petition led by the Georgetown Israel Alliance, a campus organization promoting education and discussion about current events and issues surrounding Israel and the Middle East. The petition was signed by over 130 students and three other student organizations asking the university to cancel the event for giving a platform to a speaker with a history of antisemitism without allowing other voices to contest his beliefs.
The petition, signed by Georgetown University College Democrats, the Jewish Student Association, the fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi and GIA, as well as individual students, claimed Peled’s previous remarks constitute hate speech.
“While it is important that a variety of opinions and perspectives are represented in a discussion of the Israel-Palestine conflict, Mr. Peled’s rhetoric crosses a line into hate speech, as demonstrated by his social media accounts and speeches at past events,” the petition reads.
On a Georgetown Zoom webinar titled “Anti-Zionism vs. Anti-Semitism”, Peled spoke about the Israel-Palestine conflict and discussed how he delineates where anti-Zionism ends and antisemitism begins. Anti-Zionism is generally defined as a political ideology in opposition to the state of Israel, whereas antisemitism is prejudice against the Jewish people.
President of GU-Qatar SJP Zain Assaf (SFS ’23) moderated the conversation with Peled.
“The groups that oppose my views and wanted to silence the event at Georgetown did not act because they are Jewish. Their opposition is a result of their Zionism, a racist, violent ideology,” Peled wrote in an email to The Hoya. “The work that is being done by students for justice in Palestine is heroic.”
GU SJP and GU-Q SJP did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.
The petition said Peled’s past comments reflect antisemitism. In tweets from 2016 cited in the petition, he compared the Israel Defense Forces to Nazi Germany’s Gestapo and referred to Jewish people as “sleazy thieves” in reference to U.S. aid to Israel.
Despite the petition’s concerns, Peled did not infringe Gerogetown’s Speech and Expression policy, so administrators did not intervene, according to a university spokesperson.
“Georgetown University is committed to the free and open exchanges of ideas, even if those ideas may be found difficult or objectionable by some,” a university spokesperson wrote in an email to The Hoya. “Faculty members and student groups with access to benefits may invite any outside speaker or guest to speak on campus or at a virtual event. An appearance of any speaker or guest on campus, or at a Georgetown virtual event, is not an endorsement by Georgetown University.”
While the university is committed to the principle of free speech, it also stands against bigotry, hatred and racism, according to a university spokesperson.
“While we affirm that open discourse, discussion and debate are essential components of academic life — we also have foundational values that stand in clear opposition to bigotry, hatred, and racism, and in clear support of assuring that every student is welcomed and respected in our community,” a university spokesperson wrote.
However, the petition argued that the event does not promote free speech because of its webinar format. Although there was a Q and A portion of the event, students could not interact with Peled face-to-face.
“While in normal times we would move to condemn this event and then try to engage with the speaker/attendees regarding their antisemtic viewpoints, the use of Georgetown’s webinar function makes it impossible for attendees to directly interact with the speak or other attendees,” the petition read. 
Although the petition took the position that the format of the event should be changed, the event went forward as planned.
During the conversation with GU SJP presidents, Peled suggested antisemitism and anti-Zionism do not overlap and instead stand in opposition to one another. 
“The title could just as well have been the difference between racism and anti-racism. Antisemitism is a form of racism,” Peled said. “Anti-Zionism is a struggle against or a stance against a racist political ideology. Zionism is a racist political ideology.” 
Peled also compared the Israeli-Palestinian divide to aparthied and accused the Israeli government of genocide and ethnic cleansing.   
“If you believe in the rights of humans — rights in general — if you believe in the rights of refugees to return to their homes, and be given restitution and compensation, if you believe that people should have a right to equality, then you cannot but oppose and reject Zionism,” Peled said.
Rebecca Stekol (SFS ’21), co-president of JSA — one of the four organizations that signed the petition — said the event’s choice to only allow Peled’s definition of anti-Zionism and antisemitism to be heard is dangerous because people may think Peled’s opinion is held by all Jewish people. (Full disclosure: Stekol formerly served as a deputy opinion editor and an opinion columnist for The Hoya.)
“More than anything, it was a careless choice,” Stekol wrote in an email to The Hoya. “I am disappointed in their planning of this event because it is wrong to ask one Jewish person, who espouses views that have crossed into antisemitism, to paint an umbrella definition of what is and is not antisemitism.”
Stekol added that SJP could have invited other speakers to talk about Zionism who would have better acknowledged that the intersection between anti-Zionism and antisemitism is a complex topic. 
“That is an ongoing dialogue among the entire Jewish community, and there is not just one definition that neatly fits anti-Zionism and antisemitism into separate boxes, because the line is easily blurred,” Stekol wrote. “We need to retain agency over this dialogue. In addition, there are many other progressive, pro-Palestine Jews that SJP could have reached out to who do not espouse antisemitic rhetoric.”
During the Q and A portion of the event, a student confronted Peled by accusing him of antisemitism and bringing up his past tweets, including one from 2016 and a 2019 tweet in which he called Zionism a sign of dual loyalty to the governments of the United States and Israel. Peled denied he was antisemitic and said he had never made antisemitic statements.
“The question that you have submitted, that you or somebody submitted to you to ask, is false. None of it is true. None of it happened. I did not express any form of antisemitism in any of my expressions at all, ever,” Peled said.
Stekol expressed disappointment with how the event was ultimately allowed to proceed and said inviting a speaker who uses antisemitic rhetoric devalues the important conversation about where the line between anti-Zionism and antisemitism lies.
“In my time at Georgetown I have engaged in many meaningful dialogues about Israel/Palestine with students along a wide spectrum of opinions.” Stekol wrote. “Even though Peled is Jewish, Jews can hold antisemitic beliefs, and it is tokenizing and harmful to have him as the sole representation of Jewish voices at this event.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said that the president of Georgetown University Students for Justice in Palestine moderated the event alongside the president of GU Qatar SJP, who in fact was the only person to speak with Peled. The article has been updated to reflect this information.

As a former adjunct teacher at the University of California at Irvine, I had the chance to attend one of Peled’s speaking events there years ago. He is a hot-tempered radical who has turned his back on his own country and aligned himself with those seeking to destroy the Jewish state. When he spoke at UCI, he objected to my videotaping him, which was my right in a public event in a public venue. As for his friends in the SJP, they are a bunch of brown shirts, who use disruption, bullying, and intimidation to silence their opponents. I have personally witnessed their disruptive tactics on campus. He has a strange concept of heroes.
Peled has the right of free speech. At the same time, we have the right to speak out against him.

To insult Miko Peled with the accusation of  anti-Semitism,  a man whose grandfather signed Israel’s Declaration of Independence and whose niece was killed by a Palestinian suicide bomber, is beyond the pale.  Your whole line of rhetoric is just your way of avoiding a look in the mirror he is holding up.  Easier to accuse him of anti-Semitism than address the facts.  When you find justification in the Torah for the Zionist actions against Palestinians for 74 years, maybe you will have an audience.  Until then, don’t insult a man of truth and justice with such a petulant rejection.  I guarantee you if there was a speaker who was spewing hateful Zionist rhetoric against Palestinians, you would have welcomed him or her to campus with open arms!

The Georgetown University Graduate Student Government (GradGov) will not sponsor a trip to Israel next month following internal controversy and university intervention. 
This semester, GradGov President Jonah Klempner (GRD ’22, LAW ’22) attempted to organize a trip to Israel across all graduate schools for the first time. Klempner planned the trip through itrek, a New York-based nonprofit that coordinates and subsidizes student-led group trips to Israel. 
Itrek only provides funding for students who apply through certain programs; Klempner hoped to expand access for all students by creating a subsidy program funded by the GradGov budget. 
In early February, however, the university prohibited GradGov from funding a subsidy because Klempner had not gone through the required financial and general vetting and review, according to a university spokesperson. This ban followed pushback from Klempner’s fellow GradGov members, who expressed concerns about cost disparities among trip participants, as well as the destination of the trip itself. 
The itrek trip is still scheduled to take place during spring break but without university or GradGov support. 
Given the limited funding available through itrek, Klempner proposed to the student government’s budget committee that $30,000 of GradGov student activity funds be used to subsidize the trip for students who could not apply to itrek’s STEM and Policy subsidization program, according to an email from GradGov senator Jillian Robins (GRD ’23) to all GradGov Senators, obtained by The Hoya. 
“GradGov Senators, outside the STEM and Policy coverage will get a substantial subsidy from GradGov to help cover the $2,400 dollar cost of the trip,” according to the trip application.
While the application limited the subsidy to GradGov senators, the subsidy actually proposed in the budget would have allowed all students to apply, regardless of relationship to GradGov, Klempner said.
Still, there were concerns over the fact that the trip’s student leaders — including Klempner — would not have to pay as much while other trip participants would, according to Robins, who also represents the Arab studies program.
The four trip leaders, who were recommended by Klempner but ultimately approved by itrek, would plan and lead the trip. This meant that these leaders would receive a subsidy from itrek, according to a document obtained by The Hoya. 
Klempner denied handling GradGov funds or using GradGov funds in an unethical manner after the university pulled funding.
“I never touch money from GradGov or itrek, no GradGov funds were apportioned, and the trip can and will take place without GradGov,” Klempner wrote to The Hoya. “I volunteered and was chosen as an itrek trip leader months before I volunteered and was elected GradGov president.”
Administrators from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) made it clear to GradGov that GradGov funds could not be allocated toward the itrek trip, according to a university spokesperson.
The university ultimately has the final decision on how student organizations manage their funds, according to Alexander Sens, dean of the GSAS.
“It is therefore, just a matter of pure fact, legally, ethically and financially the university’s money, and we have a fiduciary responsibility to oversee the use of that money,” Sens said at a Feb. 18 GradGov meeting. 
The university did not specify the exact errors Klempner committed in the vetting process. 
In addition to the funding structure, students also expressed concerns about the trip’s destination, according to Robins.
“If it were solely for professional development, why does it need to go to Israel? Why does it need to go to an apartheid state?” Robins said. “Why couldn’t it be held in New York or in D.C. or on campus for that reason? There are plenty of opportunities for professional development that would be cheaper and not involving an apartheid state.”
Amnesty International, a human rights non-governmental organization, recently declared Israel to be an apartheid state. Israel commits crimes against humanity and imposes institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians, prevents travel through checkpoints and displaces Palestinians. 
Nooran Alhamdan (GRD ’22), a graduate student in the Arab studies program, said it is important for students to understand the complicated relations of the Israel-Palestine region.
“I know that we’re all students and money is short, and this is something that is normal for a person to want to go on an all-expense-paid trip, but my message to students would be to please do your research,” Alhamdan told The Hoya.
Klempner affirmed at a meeting about the trip that the students who were against the trip were not motivated by antisemitism or bigotry.  
Daniel Schoolenberg (GRD ’22), set to be a leader of the trip alongside Klempner, said that the immersive experience of the trip would be valuable for all students.
“I think everyone will gain an understanding about an extremely important and dynamic part of the world that they wouldn’t be able to get otherwise,” Schoolenberg wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
The trip’s educational purposes would align with GradGov’s constitution and would aim to facilitate dialogue and learning among participants, according to Klempner.
“This educational trip which includes leaders, students, and speakers from all faiths and backgrounds, features a series of compassionate dialogues,” Klempner wrote.
This article was updated on Feb. 25 to clarify details about the trip’s application/structure and correct details about Israel’s status as an apartheid state and student concerns about the trip.

This had nothing to do with budgets and everything to do with targeted bigotry toward Israel and an effort to sever ties with the world community in the name of Palestinian solidarity.
“We, a coalition of graduate and undergraduate students at Georgetown University, are pleased to declare that we successfully blocked $30,000 of student funding from financing a trip to Israel with the pro-Israel organization, itrek, and fully cut the trip’s institutional links to Georgetown University and the university’s Graduate Student Government (GradGov), in line with BDS principles of academic boycott.”

CW: This article discusses mass violence in Ukraine. Please refer to the end of the article for on- and off-campus resources.
“Slava Ukraini! Glory to Ukraine,” students cried at a demonstration outside Healy Hall in support of Ukrainians facing a Russian invasion. 
Georgetown University students, staff and community members alike donned Ukrainian flags and signs with messages of support to gather at the steps of Healy Hall and show solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The March 2 demonstration featured Ukrainian student speakers, as well as former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst (SFS ’74). 
Since the invasion, Inna Cherniak (SFS-Q ’23), who is from Ukraine, and her friend have shared shifts monitoring airstrikes in their hometown each night. 
“This is the reality that Ukrainians have been living in for the past six days,” Cherniak said at the demonstration. “Whenever I call my parents, they don’t know what day of the week it is, they don’t know what date it is, but they do know that it’s the sixth day since Russia invaded Ukraine.” 
Since the invasion of Ukraine more than 700 civilians have been killed and more than one million civilians have fled the country.  
Herbst said the crisis in Ukraine poses a threat to the world if it is not taken seriously. 
“What’s happening in Ukraine is both a moral outrage and a direct challenge to critical American interests,” Herbst said at the demonstration. “I hope you’re here because you support strong American Western policy to say no to Putin, because our lives are not on the line here, but our prosperity is and the world that your children will inherit is.”
The most important things people can do to help Ukraine are increasing awareness, urging their representatives to stand up for Ukraine, and donating money to Ukrainian support efforts, according to Andrii Sendziuk (MSB ’24).
“Money is really important in this situation, not only because of the contrasts between the Russian and Ukrainian armies, but also because there are so many displaced people,” Sendziuk said in an interview with The Hoya. “If anybody can donate anything, I think they definitely should and I think every single person in Ukraine would be utterly grateful for any smallest donation.” 
Many organizations have begun to raise money for Ukraine including UNICEF, which supports the safety of children and families in the country; Médecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders, which helps people travel to health care facilities; and Voices of Children, which provides psychological and psychosocial support for children who experience violent conflict. 
Since the Feb. 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Georgetown community has come together to express their support for Ukrainians. Beyond the demonstration, students have also taken to Red Square to raise awareness for the crisis in Ukraine. Their table displays images of the Ukrainian flag and messages like “Ukraine is not yet lost” and “Stop the war.”  
Sendziuk, who grew up in Ukraine and helped lead the tabling effort in Red Square, said their goal is to spread information about the invasion that may otherwise be inaccessible in the United States. 
“We want to make sure that people can speak to us Ukrainians and people who are directly affected,” Sendziuk told The Hoya. “We can tell them from first person what’s going on, what we are hearing from our families, what we are hearing from the Ukrainian news — information that would not be accessible in the U.S. otherwise.” 
Ukrainian American Orest Mahlay (COL ’22), who has family in Ukraine, said it is important to spread awareness of the situation in order to combat Russian disinformation. 
“One way we’re trying to reach out to students is by allowing students that don’t know much about the situation to read more about it and just kind of read and fact check information about the war,” Mahlay said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Ukrainian officials have urged American tech giants including Facebook and others to restrict Russian access to their platforms to combat Russian disinformation about the invasion. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has banned Russian state-run media from sellings advertisements on its platform and has removed some accounts spreading disinformation. 
Nicholas Frayter (MSB ’23), the founder of Georgetown Russian Association, has attended multiple anti-war demonstrations, and said he and many other Russians oppose the invasion of Ukraine.
“I think it is important to note that a lot of Russians do not want this war at all — it’s just one man that’s calling for this war,” Frayter said in an interview with The Hoya. “When you speak to people, they really want peace and don’t agree with what the government is doing.”
More than 6,000 Russian citizens have been arrested for protesting against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Ira Tiasko (SFS ’23), who is also from Ukraine, said people must remember to consider the human impact the invasion is having. 
“I’ve had a lot of professors talking about Ukraine as if it was a chess game, and it is disgusting,” Tiasko said in an interview with The Hoya. “If we start treating everything like a chess game, it’s gonna be really sad to live in the future.”
Josh Anderson (COL ’25), who has attended anti-war demonstrations, said it is important for non-Ukrainians like himself to show solidarity with the Ukrainian people.
“People like me who aren’t Ukrainian are there to show support not only in numbers, but in helping to chant, to amplify the message in person and on social media,” Anderson said in an interview with The Hoya. “If we allow this illegal invasion against Ukraine and this violation of human rights, that can just create a sort of colossal impact that escalates into other countries around the world.”
Although Ukrainians are strong, Cherniak said, they need the world’s support. 
“Ukrainian defenders are strong, but they shouldn’t do this alone,” Cherniak said. “I urge you to keep supporting Ukraine, to keep standing with Ukraine and pleading your governments and representatives to keep standing with Ukraine. Together, we will win.”

Georgetown Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) hosted their annual Israeli Apartheid Week to stand in solidarity with the people of Palestine and raise awareness about the human rights abuses they face.
The event, which was held from March 14 to 18, featured events regarding advocacy for the people of Palestine, beginning with an Apartheid Week launch in Red Square. Other events included a tile painting event and a panel discussion on March 17. There was also a Palestine Gala on March 18, which featured music, food, art, dabka — a Palestinian dance style — and other performances.  
Israel has systematically discriminated against Palestinians who live under Israel’s rule in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), according to a report by human rights group Amnesty International. Israel has also forcibly displaced Palestinians through coercive measures, including home demolitions. 
Georgetown SJP planned Apartheid Week in partnership with the Georgetown Muslim Students Association (MSA), Stand with Kashmir, Gender Justice Initiative (GJI), Black Student Alliance, Black Graduate Student Alliance and Alliance of Graduate Employees. 
Last month, Amnesty International named Israel an apartheid state due to its treatment of Palestinians. Apartheid is a crime against humanity under international law. In the report, Amnesty said Israel has enacted laws that create a system of control over Palestinians.  
SJP planned Apartheid Week to increase awareness about the Palestinian freedom struggle, according to an anonymous member of MSA and SJP, who requested their name be withheld due to safety concerns.  
“We’re just hoping to change the views that people have and get more people educated about what’s really going on over there,” the MSA and SJP member told The Hoya. 
Georgetown SJP operates under Students for Justice in Palestine, a worldwide network of college activism organizations. 
GJI Director Melyssa Haffaf said that GJI chose to partner with SJP to host the event to raise awareness about what is happening in Palestine.  
“We believe it was a great educational forum for those who are not necessarily familiar with the history of this ongoing struggle and bring visibility to other movements striving for advancing justice and equity,” Haffaf wrote in an email to The Hoya. 
A SJP representative, who asked to remain anonymous due to fear of the risks of public Palestinian advocacy, said the involvement of many student clubs in the week of events signals a shift in perspectives on the issue. 
“So many organizations showed support, and that would have been unimaginable a few years ago — it really shows growth in this movement and the way that people are looking at Palestine as a smaller part of a bigger, interconnected problem that we need to solve,” the SJP representative said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Khury Petersen-Smith, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and an expert on the Middle East, spoke at the Apartheid Week panel. 
He and other panelists framed the issue in an innovative way, Petersen-Smith said. 
“In the panel, we worked to lay out why we understand this as a struggle for justice not only in terms of justice for Palestinians, but in the context of various struggles around the world,” Petersen-Smith said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Petersen-Smith’s panel, titled “Interconnected Liberation,” focused on the links between Palestinian liberation struggles and justice and liberation struggles in the United States and elsewhere. 
Idun Hauge (GRD ’24), decided to join SJP last week after hearing about Apartheid Week from a friend on the SJP board. 
“There’s very little awareness in the U.S. about crimes against Palestinians, the really kind of horrible conditions that people live under,” Hauge said in an interview with The Hoya. 
Last week Georgetown SJP circulated posters promoting the week of events around campus, according to the MSA and SJP member, which were subsequently removed from Red Square by unknown individuals. 
“That was definitely the most unsettling thing that happened in our week, having our advertising and pretty much our freedom of speech restricted by certain students on campus,” the MSA and SJP member said.
Georgetown is committed to free and open inquiry on campus through verbal and nonverbal expression. Some areas on campus, including Red Square, are considered “public squares,” spaces available for student expression without registration requirements. 
After the investigation of the Georgetown University Police Department into the ripping down of posters, SJP was able to identify one student who ripped down posters, but the organization chose not to disclose their identity to The Hoya. 
On March 15, Interim Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students Jeanne F. Lord sent an email to all students reemphasizing university free speech policy.
“On our Hilltop campus, Red Square is uniquely located as a public forum expressly designed for the impromptu and ongoing expression of ideas and viewpoints by members of our campus community,” the email reads. 
Georgetown Israel Alliance (GIA) President Daniel Rogov (COL ’23) said he and GIA condemn the removal of SJP’s posters.
“As Georgetown students, it is essential that we support and actively defend each other’s right to free speech,” Rogov wrote to The Hoya. 
Still, GIA stands against the actual messaging of Apartheid Week, according to Rogov.
“Classifying Israel as an apartheid state is not only incorrect, but dangerously misinformed,” Rogov wrote. “This misinformation is counterproductive to promoting genuine reforms in Israel, and has the potential to harm Israeli citizens of all religions and ethnicities in undermining the nation’s legitimacy.”
The MSA and SJP member said the event was a success due to high student engagement.
“We definitely did have a few people who passed by who clearly expressed some disagreement, some people secretly recording us, but for the most part it was positive responses,” the MSA and SJP member said. 
UPDATE: This article was updated March 30 to retract the identity of the source now referred to as the “MSA and SJP member.” The source requested anonymity on March 29 due to the fear of safety risks surrounding public Palestinian advocacy.

A Johns Hopkins professor presented her new book on the logistical and communicational behavior of insurgent forces during the Lebanon Civil War at a Walsh School of Foreign Service (SFS) event.
Georgetown’s Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS), the only academic center in the United States exclusively dedicated to studying the Arab world, hosted the Jan. 17 discussion with professor Sarah Parkinson. During the talk, Parkinson explored the inspiration behind her book, “Beyond the Lines: Social Networks and Palestinian Militant Organizations in Wartime Lebanon,” and described how guerilla militant groups combated the operational and resource disadvantages of asymmetrical warfare.
Parkinson said the book aims to capture the human element of warfare that is often ignored in traditional military analysis. 
“In Beyond the Lines, I’m interested in deemphasizing battlefield scorecards, which emphasize the actions of fighters, in favor of analyzing how both combatant and non-combatant labor shape organizational and political trajectories,” Parkinson said at the event. “So the argument here is that understanding people’s lived experiences of conflict is not simply a humanitarian necessity, it’s a political imperative.”
Parkinson began by describing the stories of several young women in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), highlighting their multifaceted duties. 
Alongside their expertise in firearms and combat, these PLO soldiers serve as battlefield medics, ambulance drivers, nurses, logisticians and social workers, according to Parkinson. 
“Every armed conflict involves backstage labor, logistical intelligence, medicine, finance and human resources that may not involve using a weapon,” Parkinson said at the event. “Indeed, most experienced militants with whom I’ve spoken do not consider the physical labor of killing the most important aspect of armed conflict.”
Parkinson then discussed the ways military networks structure themselves, and said insurgent groups are often organized as a complex web that involves intimate personal connections and social roles as opposed to a regimented, linear ladder.
“If you think about what a military organization looks like, it’s a hierarchy, top to bottom,” Parkinson said. “However, think about how all of the people in that are in multiple networks at the same time. Someone who is a soldier is also a spouse, is also a member of a sports team.”
Parkinson also explored how militias utilize stereotypes at the intersection of gender and age, such as underestimating the capabilities of older women, to their benefit for communication purposes. 
“One of the people I knew who had been in a guerrilla organization talked about this little old lady who would stand next to a collaborator and drop a bag of groceries. That’s how we knew we had to target that person,” Parkinson said.
While discussing the common presentation of non-combat roles like document forgery, which are often done by women, as merely indirect support, Parkinson said these roles are highly specialized and require far more skill than ground soldiers. 
“I can give an 18-year-old guy a gun and train him to shoot at the broadside of a barn,” Parkinson said.“And then I can think about what it takes to forge a passport, which is what a lot of these support roles are. Are you confident smuggling $10,000 in cash tomorrow? These are high-skilled roles requiring incredible people skills that most 16 to 18-year-olds do not have.”
Looking forward, Parkinson said she expects U.S. activism strategy to parallel the tactics rebel forces in the Middle East have used to achieve their political goals. 
“Regarding American reproductive rights issues that have returned, you will get old people mobilizing because they have old networks from when they were protesting in the 70s,” Parkinson said. “They’re back out there in a very particular way because of how they understand a particular mode of repression.”

The School of Foreign Service (SFS) awarded the annual J. Raymond “Jit” Trainor Award to William J. Burns, a former U.S. ambassador and the current director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in a Feb. 2 ceremony. 
The Trainor Award, named after a former SFS registrar, is handed out on a yearly basis to an exemplar of excellent conduct in diplomacy. Burns won the award in 2022, but he could not attend a ceremony in-person until now because of ongoing commitments with the federal response to the war in Ukraine. 
Burns served as a diplomat for 33 years before retiring in 2014. Throughout his career in diplomacy, Burns served as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs during the September 11 terrorist attacks, Senior Director for Near East and South Asian Affairs at the National Security Council, U.S. Ambassador to Russia, U.S. Ambassador to Jordan and Deputy Secretary of State. 
After receiving the award, Burns offered remarks responding to global threats and engaged in a conversation with Ambassador Barbara K. Bodine, a professor in the practice of diplomacy and director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, a Georgetown University center dedicated to exploring diplomacy and global issues..
Burns said encouragement from his father and his father’s service in the military first sparked Burns’ decision to enter a career in diplomacy.
“Public service has shaped my whole life. When I was a graduate student many years ago, trying to figure out what to do with my life, I got a letter that proved to inspire me,” Burns said at the event. “It was from my father, a remarkable career army officer and a fine man who died recently. ‘Nothing will make you prouder,’ my dad wrote, ‘than to serve your country with honor.’”
Burns said this advice served as his inspiration over his decades-long career in foreign service in countries across the globe. 
Looking to the future, Iran should be a central focus for American policymakers approaching the often-murky relationship between the United States and the Middle East, according to Burns.
“The Middle East has emerged as a particularly complicated set of challenges for American policymakers as well,” Burns said, “Part of that is about the Iranian regime that I think is increasingly unsettled about what’s going on inside Iran.”
Burns said that instability in Iran can be attributed to protests in the country speaking out against the current regime.
“The remarkable courage of demonstrators over the last few months, especially young Iranian women, who in many respects are fed up with economic decay, corruption, political oppression and social restrictions, I think that unsettled view of what is going on internally is leading to more aggressive behavior externally toward the Iranian regime,” Burns said.
After the September 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman who died while in police detention, protests swept Iran with demands for increased freedom in the country. While similar protests occurred in Iran in 2009, 2017 and 2019, the ongoing movement is the most widespread in recent memory.
Burns said addressing ongoing turmoil in the Middle East, including conflict in the Israel-Palestine region, will be an engaging task to take on in his work as CIA director.
Recent developments in the region, including a shift to the right in Israeli elections and clashes between Israelis and Palestinians, have sparked fears that conflict could spiral. In a recent visit to Jerusalem, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged both sides to remain calm and begin to work toward restabilization.
“We see it across the Middle East,” Burns said. “Part of the responsibility of my agency is to work as closely as we can with Palestinian security services and Israeli security services to prevent the kind of exposure to violence that we have seen in recent weeks as well. That is going to be a good challenge.”
Burns said his personal experiences in public service have prepared him for his current position leading a national intelligence agency.
“Today, I am still in the arena, very proud to have been a career diplomat and equally proud now to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, leading another incredibly dedicated group of women and men at a moment of profound transformation on the international landscape,” Burns said.

Flags flew high and the aroma of delicious cuisine filled the air April 15 as almost 30 different campus organizations celebrated their unique cultures through food and performances at the 2023 Global Expo. 
The International Student Association, an organization that aims to foster community among international students, and Office of Global Services, which aids international Hoyas with visa and immigration-related affairs, co-hosted the event, which featured distinct cultures and ethnic groups from across the globe. Nations and regions represented included Greece, Ukraine, the Caribbean, Eritrea, Palestine, South Asia and France, among many others. 
Alongside serving international dishes, the event showcased dance and music performances from groups like GU Jawani, a bhangra dance team; the Vietnamese Student Association, an affinity group for Vietnamese Hoyas; the Hellenic Association, a community for Greek and Cypriot students; and the Ballet Folklorico Mexicano, a student dance ensemble for traditional Mexican ballet. 
Chris Tengey (CAS ’26), a Ghanaian American who lived in Ghana for several years as a child, said events like the Global Expo are key in engaging in cultural conversations to embrace diversity at Georgetown University.
“You can go to an event and know individuals have similar backgrounds,” Tengey told The Hoya. “You can also learn from other people and how their backgrounds have shaped them.”
Student cultural and religious groups, academic departments and sports teams alike participated in the event at tables displaying a sample of their corner of the world. For instance, the Armenian Student Association (ASA) set up a table and shared Armenian food.
ASA member Armen Asik (SOH ’25) said he appreciates spaces to express campus diversity and demonstrate pride in his Armenian identity.
“Georgetown’s a university that encourages a lot of multiculturalism, and it was good that we were represented even though we’re a small club on campus,” Asik told The Hoya. “There aren’t a lot of Armenians who go to Georgetown, but we’re very proud to be Armenian.”
Lela Tolajian (SFS ’26), another member of the ASA, said the best part of joining the organization is the Armenian community she’s made on campus.
“We do a lot of cultural events,” Tolajian told The Hoya. “We’ve gotten together and had food, and gone to protests together.”
Kyryl Myronenko (SFS ’26), a member of the Ukrainian Society, said he enjoyed sharing his country’s culture at the event.
“Global Expo was nothing but a great time on a Sunny Saturday on the Copley Lawn! At the Ukrainian Society’s table, we had varenyky (traditional dumplings), syrnyky (cheese pancakes), kompot (sweet beverage), Ukrainian candy, and many more,” Myronenko wrote to The Hoya.
Myronenko said food was a key channel for fostering connections and introducing students to Ukrainian culture.
“Through presenting cuisine, all students engaged in intercultural dialogue and were able to share with the student body something important to their identity,” Myronenko wrote. “It was a wonderful opportunity to meet new students and spread the word about Ukrainian culture!”
Tengey said he hopes Georgetown will continue to foster intercultural dialogue to welcome new and existing students, especially those from abroad.
“I think it’s important that Georgetown as an institution creates spaces where people of color feel safe and feel in community, especially if they are coming from parts of the country or other areas of the world where their culture is very unique to them,” Tengey told The Hoya. “So it feels like home to them when they come here and can adapt easier.”
