SHANGHAI, China — Reports from various news sources Tuesday indicated that China has blocked internet access within the country to popular websites Twitter, Hotmail, Flickr and others.
While many within the country felt it was only a matter of time before this happened — I had already assumed the country’s censorship when my furious attempts to refresh Twitter were fruitless — I find this action on the Chinese government’s behalf to be truly pointless.
As the 20th anniversary of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising nears, China has decided to crack down on popular websites to prevent discussion of the taboo topic.
This is only one of many steps the government has already taken in its attempts to filter the information that reaches its citizens: The local media is censored, news outlets from other unfavorable countries such as Taiwan are prohibited and, after hosting videos of Tibet, YouTube is also blocked.
China’s hush-hush attitude might successfully stop political tweets about June 4, 1989 (a search that purposefully yields no results when Googling websites in Chinese), but how long can it keep playing this game?
It might take years, but the Chinese are slowly being exposed to people, events and ideas they never learned in their history classes or heard their parents speak of.
Though most of this can be attributed to the Internet — which explains the government’s efforts — information also spreads through other channels. With traveling professionals, exchange students, tourists and the global economy, China cannot shut down all exposure to potentially risky topics, and frankly officials shouldn’t even try. Why delay the inescapable?
What’s more, though, is that a once-sheltered society is learning — and liking — the ways of outsiders. As China embraces the joys of capitalism, its people are left wondering what else they are missing out on that the rest of the world is enjoying.
The thirst for knowledge might not be as intense as the thirst for money, yet ultimately having American identities like McDonald’s in Shanghai has given China a glimpse of what’s outside its great (fire)walls.
And so far, they are lovin’ it.
The country is growing ever so quickly, and its leaders do not understand that despite their best efforts, the spread of information is inevitable. If global marketing can make its way into Chinese minds (as Chinese mistresses demand BMWs and Balenciagas), then it won’t be much longer before democratic principles and ideals seep into the public consciousness as well.
China, I beg of you — please stop fighting the inevitable. You will only alienate and infuriate the citizens who already know of what you are trying to hide and spur them to try harder to enlighten others.
Additionally, your attempts will only close off the country to the rest of the world — foreigners who are putting faith in you and taking a chance by investing in your capital, trying to live in your country and visiting your monuments to learn about your wonderful history and legacy.
Why make that legacy tainted?

Ana Pedroso was always late.
She didn’t know not to be, until she took USC’s new American Culture Class, a no-credit class aimed at introducing graduate students from other countries to life in Los Angeles.
“I am Brazilian — I am always late,” Pedroso, a graduate student studying economics, said. “They said that if we make an appointment we should be five minutes earlier. This is a detail that I think makes a difference and I would never learn such a thing in a book.”
Teaching things not found in books is precisely the aim of the American Culture Class, created by Chrissy Roth, assistant director of the Office of Orientation Programs and Becky Peterson, an international adviser in the Office of International Services. The class, which debuted last fall and is expanding to offer more sections for the upcoming semester, strives to provide international students with a grasp of some of the finer details of American culture.
Those details range from communication styles to politics to football.
“Football is very popular in the U.S. but in China we don’t have that kind of sport,” said Qi Li, a doctoral candidate in computer science. “So we spent one class to learn football. It is still very complex for me, but I already know the basic rules so maybe I could attend this season’s match to get involved in sports.”
Roth, who co-taught the class both semesters and will assist in training next semester’s instructors, said football was actually one of the most difficult subjects to teach.
“Explaining football and baseball is so incredibly difficult for someone who has never even seen a football,” she said. “It’s kind of realizing that you really have to start with the basics — things that you would never teach Americans, things that Americans just kind of know.”
Starting with the basics can mean explaining how to know if a girl likes you, describing why the Monica Lewinsky scandal was a big deal in the United States, negating Hollywood stereotypes or teaching that Americans don’t arrive late.
While former students of the American Culture Class appreciated this practical knowledge, many said what stood out more to them was the way the class approached larger topics — issues of communication, relationships and diversity — and the opportunity for dialogue.
“What impressed me most was this communication and this channel of sharing thoughts about the beginning of life as a foreign student in the U.S.,” Pedroso said.
Chen Chen, a graduate student studying strategic public relations from China, felt the same way.
“I cannot confidently say that I successfully transit myself into American culture,” Chen wrote in an e-mail. “To some extent, many of my Chinese friends have done a much better job than I do. However, I think the value of the class is to have a face-to-face communication to establish mutual understanding among people from different countries.”
While the students learn about diversity in America in one of the most diverse cities in the country, they also learn from the members of the class. Though most of the students come from Asian countries — which Pedroso said made her feel lonely at first — there is a varied representation of cultures.
“It’s a good spread that we have,” Peterson said. “China, Korea, India, Japan, Sri Lanka … just by the numbers we couldn’t have everybody represented but the interest was across the spectrum of our countries.”
Li said she felt the presence of different cultures allowed for a productive dialogue.
“I think it is a good way to communicate with people and to explain some things and maybe some conflicts to each other,” said Li. “The most useful thing I think is the diversity and we get to know what everybody thinks and to think this way we could minimize the conflicts between cultures.”
Both Roth and Peterson said they learned as much teaching the class as the students did.
“I’ve learned that apparently Americans do their laundry incorrectly,” Roth said. “I’ve learned that in China they don’t give out fortune cookies at the end of the meal. And then on a deeper level, I’ve learned how incredibly brave these students are for coming in from all over the world with a language barrier, without having friends or family around them, really to get an education to better themselves — usually so they can bring it back to their country, so they can better their country. And it’s something that I don’t think I would ever have the strength to do, and I just admire them so much. They really are inspiring people.”
The program will expand to three sections for the upcoming semesters — compared to one that was offered this year — to better accommodate the number of interested students. Though Roth and Peterson will not teach the class, they will train the new instructors, who will be graduate students and representatives of different departments at USC.
Peterson said the experience was inspiring.
“It’s incredibly, incredibly rewarding and beautiful,” she said. “You just step back and go: ‘That was cool.’”

East Coast natives, especially those hailing from the Tri-State area, come to Los Angeles with a heavy bias, one made heavier by Woody Allen’s infamous grudge with the City of Angels — it was Allen, after all, who quipped, “I don’t want to move to a city where the only cultural advantage is being able to make a right turn on a red light.”
It’s hard to blame Allen: With its concrete overpasses, dwarfed architecture and distant neighborhoods that are seemingly impossible to get to by anything but one’s own car, Los Angeles comes across as a city even colder, more closed-off than Manhattan residents.
The car culture in California is undeniable. But with the price of parking and gasoline almost as high as Manhattan’s skyline, and the prospect of being “green” no longer a radical political statement but an entirely possible lifestyle, a return to LA’s public transportation system, however schizophrenically constructed and utterly ineffective it might appear in the eyes of serial L-train riders, is long overdue. As USC has transcended its commuter-school reputation in the past decade to solidify itself as a member of the community, so can Los Angeles redefine itself as a city of cultural immersion rather than segregation.
It all starts with LA residents.

How to travel by bus…
200 — Echo Park via Hoover and Alvarado
Departing across from the University Village Starbucks, the 200 takes you to Los Angeles’ most colorful neighborhood. Independent bookstores, cozy cafes and obscure concert venues are all within walking distance of the Sunset and Alvarado stop.
201 — Silver Lake
Similar to the 200, the 201 takes you to Echo Park’s cleaner, self-consciously hipster counterpart. The Sunset and Parkman stop is just several blocks east of Sunset Junction, the dine-and-shop mecca for Silver Lake residents.
 
Metro Rapid 720
Follow this rapid line down Wilshire Boulevard and watch the scenery change from neon-lit Korean strip malls to art-deco architecture of the Miracle Mile district to upscale high rises and designer stores of, alas, Bruin territory.
Metro Rapid 754 —
Hollywood via Vermont
The 754 is a necessity for LA residents living within walking distance of Vermont Avenue. Running until Sunset Boulevard, the 754 is the gateway bus that can take you to numerous other lines, including the 004, which travels westward on Sunset Boulevard, and the Red Line rail.
Metro Local and Express 460 — Disneyland
Though it requires waking up at ungodly hours on a Saturday, catching the 460 at Flower Street brings you to the front entrance of the happiest place on Earth — a fun day trip for those with some spare time between papers.

…or by rail
Red Line
Beginning at Downtown’s historic Union Station — Los Angeles’ next best thing to Penn Station — the Red Line pummels through the heart of Hollywood via Vermont Avenue. Before catching a matinee at the Pantages Theater at Hollywood and Vine or trying Steven Speilberg’s feet on for size in front of Grauman’s Chinese Theater at Hollywood and Highland, hop off at Vermont and Santa Monica and enjoy some of the best (and cheapest) Mexican food in town at El Gran Burrito. If Mexican cuisine doesn’t satisfy your taste buds, the Red Line ends just over the hill at Universal City Walk, a LA hotspot that hosts kitsch-y restaurants and bars such as Bucca Di Beppo, Hard Rock Cafe and Saddle Ranch.
Purple Line
One of only two subways, or heavy rail lines, of the Los Angeles County Metro (the other being the aforementioned Red Line), the Purple Line offers a limited variety of stops, serving primarily Downtown Los Angeles and Koreatown. Departing from Union Station, the Purple Line hits historical landmarks Pershing Square and MacArthur Park before careening into Koreatown. The line comes to a quick end at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue, across from The Wiltern Theater — for those who want to catch the latest indie rock act in town.
The Gold Line
Leaving from Union Station, the Gold Line’s very first stop on its light rail route is Chinatown. Once out of the station, walk west on College Street to Broadway, Chinatown’s main drag, where you’ll find the historic gateway adorned with dragons on your left and several markets, including the Bamboo Plaza, on your right. Head further north on the rail and visit the Southwest Museum, the Old LA Farmers Market adjacent to the Highland Park station, or the shops at Old Town Pasadena via the Del Mar station. Also, look out this month for the opening of the Gold Line’s east extension, which will include a stop in Little Tokyo.
The Blue Line
The appropriately named Blue Line takes you from the gray skies of Downtown to the clear blue waters of the Pacific — downtown Long Beach, where you will not only find a surf-side community, but also a thriving arts hub. The 1st Street stop — the line’s end — leaves you surrounded by art galleries and independent stores. The only downside to this picturesque ending is its middle section through LA county’s notoriously rough spots, Watts and Compton. For those brave at heart, take a detour at the 103rd Street station to pay tribute to the iconic Watts Towers, located several blocks away at 107th Street.

During my recent trip to Paris, the famed fashion capital of world, I was fortunate enough to witness an unlikely American commodity holding its own in the unfamiliar land of high-end labels and couture shopping. As usual, on the first day of the summer sales, hundreds of Parisians piled into all the French retail favorites — renowned designers like Louis Vuitton, Hermes and Chanel —snapping up luxury goods and last-season markdowns. But as I walked past the dazed shoppers, I was shocked by what I saw.
The recognizable all-white storefront adorned by the simple, bold black letters stood out like an outsider. “Really?” I asked myself, “an American Apparel in Paris?” The idea baffled me.
Out of curiosity, I walked inside, only to find the setting
eerily similar to a typical store in Los Angeles. Cramped aisles and edgy campaign material, check. Blinding neon fabrics, shiny lamé and colorful basics, check. Hipster teens begging their parents to buy them expensive tri-blend -shirts and metallic headbands, check. It was evident by the crowded store — even without a single sale going on — that the American Apparel craze had caught on overseas.
But how could this happen? Here at home, for some, the concept of buying a 20-something dollar plain T-shirt seems
wildly ridiculous, not to mention irresponsible given the current economic climate. While the quality may be higher and the product softer, for most consumers American Apparel would have to explain its costs in areas someplace else.
Ironically, this subtle difference just might be the key to the brand’s success. With a small bump in prices, the company has become a rising industry leader by not only reviving an unpopular business model, but also tackling important issues that for the last decade have gained heightened attention.
The first of these issues is domestic production. Though the “Made in Downtown LA” tagline might be a trendy branding strategy to loyalist consumers, it is in reality a stand for America’s economic independence — a challenge the country has faced more grippingly in recent years.
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa praised the company for not falling into the trap of outsourcing labor for cheaper wages; production in China would cost a company, on average, a mere 40 cents a worker per hour versus the more than $12 American Apparel pays its manufacturing employees, not to mention the medical, dental, ESL training and even on-site yoga benefits it also offers its employees.
Believe it or not, American Apparel, a company barely two decades old, is now the largest clothing manufacturer in the United States today — a hefty title considering the fact that many Angelenos still find the brand to be no different than the overpriced fad retail chains it competes with.
But American Apparel’s roots as a wholesaler have helped it to develop its own place in the market (the company didn’t open its first retail store until 2003). The 800,000 sq. ft. American Apparel factory, located in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles, is the largest garment factory in the nation, producing 250,000 garments daily with the help of more than 5,000 workers from the community.
Clearly, the uptick in price is crucial to keeping industry at home with safe and beneficial conditions for workers. And while other countries may care less about American labor, cost also ensures a quality product that is justified on its own by its fashion value.
“They might be a little more expensive than other brands, but I buy their clothes mostly because they fit well and it’s what’s in style right now,” said Stephanie Vazquez, a junior majoring in public relations.
Today, however, the idea of American-produced clothing has moved past being just stylish. While the American Apparel’s “trend factor” is oftentimes overwhelming — the Intelligence Group called it the “No. 2 Trend-Setting Brand” behind Nike — it might be its very cult status is vital to the brand’s survival and continued success, both at home and abroad.
Made in LA · American Apparel’s vertical integration management model means that every article of clothing is designed, dyed, cut, sewed and distributed from the company’s 800,000 sq. ft. factory at 6th and Alameda streets in Downtown Los Angeles. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
that Realizing its target demographic — as the company puts it, “20 to 32-year-old young metropolitan adults” — American Apparel has succeed in marrying fashion with popular social themes. Its fight against immigration reform was more vocally heard through their  “Legalize LA” campaign,  which undoubtedly influenced the brand’s latest “Legalize Gay” campaign — a call to repeal Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California last fall.
“It isn’t only about getting up and getting dressed in the morning. People wear things to make a statement,” said Melissa Ramboyong, a college student who shops at the store regularly. “American Apparel clothing stands for messages I can identify with.”
The company finds young customers, more likely than not, sharing its same core values and as a result, they support the American Apparel brand. Over the past decade, the company has slowly moved from being pure novelty to a highly respected fashion and social emblem by its customers. This transformation takes place only in an age where heightened political interest amongst younger people is especially prominent.
“A lot of people at USC like that fact that American Apparel T-shirts are made sweatshop-free,”  Vazquez said. “I personally don’t really look into the issues American Apparel fights for but I do see why they can be important.”
As for one of the more popular issues, the environment, American Apparel is of course working to stay green. Aside from vertical integration — a model where everything from dyeing to packaging is completely self-run — the company takes part in a host of other environmentally friendly initiatives, such as recycling fabric scraps and utilizing organic cotton and dyes. There is no doubt that these eco-friendly initiatives have aided in American Apparel’s success as a brand.
“You can feel good about buying something for a cause,” Ramboyong said.
The cause is now going global. In Paris alone there are currently six American Apparel retail stores, joining more than 80 other oversea shops in 19 foreign countries. Even in its struggle to establish an international name, American Apparel is setting the trend and sticking to its principles.

Long before sports pundits, bloggers and vaguely indignant students condemned him for inciting yet another Trojan sports ’SCandal, Tim Floyd didn’t have a whole lot going for him in the court of public opinion. The figurehead for USC’s woefully unpopular basketball program never had the avuncular charm or tech savvy of football darling Pete Carroll, nor Carroll’s advantage of heading up a star-studded NCAA colossus.
What Floyd did have was captainship of the Pac-10’s sinking Titanic, and, as spring progressed, he seemed ready to bail at any time. At the end of March, following a devastating loss to Michigan State and the end of any Final Four fantasies, he flew to Tucson to interview for a coaching position at University of Arizona. Less than a week later, Taj Gibson, DeMar DeRozan and Daniel Hackett made public their decisions to opt for the pro draft, a blow that left Floyd so far up the creek without a paddle he was in Deliverance territory.
By the time Yahoo! Sports published allegations in May that Floyd gave at least $1,000 in cash directly to one of O.J. Mayo’s confidants, the fan was on and the room was stinky. USC was already knee-deep in NCAA allegations; the Trojan football program had been under investigation for months as to whether former star Reggie Bush received up to $300,000 in improper benefits when playing at USC. The further accusation that Mayo was courted by Floyd to the tune of something close to $30,000 was not exactly a blemish on an otherwise untarnished surface, though part of the blame fell on the Harold Hill of basketball promoting, slippery Rodney Guillory.
Guillory, according to an almost certainly autobiographical Wikipedia entry, is a Southern California “event promoter.” He was famously involved in a tussle with NCAA rules in 2000 when, working as a runner for a sports agency, he provided former USC guard Jeff Trepagnier and former Fresno State guard Tito Maddox with improper benefits (including plane tickets). This was not something Floyd was unaware of when he agreed to meet with Guillory — after all, when you lie down with fleabags, you inevitably wake up dogged by an NCAA investigation.
This was the case when one of Guillory’s former friends (and, rather inconveniently for him, an ESPN sports writer), released information regarding the shady deal.
The rats fled the burning ship. In an unprecedented diaspora of up-and-coming talent, USC’s top freshman recruits — Noel Johnson and Solomon Hill — bolted for other schools. USC also stopped pursuing Renardo Sidney, another top recruit whose precarious eligibility could have entrenched the school in further NCAA trouble. Super-super senior Marcus Johnson decided to opt for the NBA Draft, even though the USC athletic program had just won him a sixth year of eligibility.
In the wake of losing all but one player who averaged more than 18 minutes of playing time a game last season, Floyd (not-so-voluntarily) tendered his resignation June 9, leaving open a position that few were vying for. While he did manage to somewhat invigorate the program before his departure — under his reign, the Trojans participated in a (sadly, USC record-breaking) streak of three straight NCAA tournaments — the added baggage of the recruiting scandal would mean whoever stepped in would have a lot on his plate.
Enter Kevin O’Neill, USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett’s fourth choice for the job. Though O’Neill has a reputation for brusque methods and an abrasive personality, at least he doesn’t come with a history of illegally buying players. It’s time for USC officials to stop turning a blind eye to fairly obvious machinations. Guillory’s shady reputation preceded him, and his undue influence in the scandal presented bigger problems within USC’s recruiting process.
USC’s decision to stop pursuing Renardo Sidney can be seen as a step in the right direction, a chance to distance itself from more trouble. (At the same time, it’s also a prime example of the pot calling the kettle litigious.)
We can only hope O’Neill’s appointment marks a necessary turning point in the Trojan sports franchise; if the USC athletic department is truly committed to maintaining a clean record, the first step is to hire coaches who will uphold that ideal.
The scandal should also, however, serve as a reminder for all branches of Trojan athletics that transparency is key. The NCAA would have undoubtedly considered issuing a more lenient punishment if any relevant officials had disclosed information about Floyd’s actions to the committee. As it is, it may be many months until a formal punishment is issued.
It’s time for O’Neill to accept the consequences on behalf of the organization and work toward rebuilding a franchise that has been floundering both ethically and on the court. USC must wash Floyd out of its hair and carry on its way.

Research · Mark Thompson, co-director of the federally funded Energy Frontier Research Center, looks at samples with a microscope. | Dieuwertje Kast 
Armed with close to $16 million in federal and institutional funding, professor P. Daniel Dapkus is spearheading an initiative to bolster the university’s presence in the burgeoning field of energy research.
Dapkus, who is also co-chair in the USC Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering, and colleagues affiliated with the departments of electrical engineering, chemistry, physics, astronomy and computer science received a five-year, $12.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science in April, and will be holding the first planning meetings within the next few weeks.
The grant is part of the Obama administration’s $777 million Energy Frontier Research Center  initiative to accelerate solar cell, biofuel and other energy research.
“Our principal goal is to do basic science research on solar energy conversion and solid state lighting for room lighting and illumination,” said Mark E. Thompson, a professor of chemistry and the center’s co-director. “We also want to develop a better understanding of the devices and study new materials.”
As director of the EFRC for Emerging Materials for Solar Energy Conversion and Solid State Lighting, Dapkus will oversee a suite of projects led by 15 participating faculty, including three from outside universities.
The center, which has full discretion over its funds, will operate independently from USC and the DoE.
In addition, the grant will enable the hiring of 25 new graduate and postdoctoral students.
“Each of the students will gain an appreciation for the challenges and modes of research of the different disciplines and gain a general understanding of the energy landscape,” Thompson said.
The first point Dapkus and Thompson are quick to stress is that they have no intention of building new cells or lights — which may seem counterintuitive given their emphasis on organic solar cells and light-emitting diodes.
Instead, the center plans to focus on developing a better understanding of the underlying components and process — to “take a look at things from the atomic level and engineer them to be the best they can be,” as Dapkus put it.
That could mean exploring the efficiency of new materials, troubleshooting existing ones or developing new structures.
Thompson said the center could eventually bring in business partners to collaborate on new projects and commercialize its work. Even then, Thompson cautions, it would likely take at least 15 to 20 years before the technologies transition from experimental to commercial.
“It’s exciting to work in an area where you’re doing basic science that will lead to something coming out in the marketplace,” Thompson said.
Cost and efficiency — or, more accurately, the lack thereof — are the principal obstacles to the wider deployment of solar cells and LEDs.
According to Dapkus, about a quarter of consumed electricity is used for lighting, of which incandescent bulbs supply a large fraction. Incandescent bulbs are very inefficient because they dissipate most of the electricity they take up as heat.
Compact fluorescent light bulbs, though a preferable alternative because of higher efficiency and longer lifespan, suffer from their own set of shortcomings: cost and their contents — like all fluorescent bulbs, CFLs contain a small amount of mercury, which is toxic to humans.
White LEDs, one of the devices Dapkus’ group is working on, are twice as efficient as CFLs and can emit over the entire light spectrum but are almost 10 times more expensive.
Silicon-based solar cells, which are commonly found in rooftop solar panels have low conversion efficiencies and remain costly compared to conventional fossil fuel-based sources.
Organic solar cells, which are made of low-cost carbon-based materials, offer a promising alternative, but the technology is still in its infancy.
As such, these cells are still too costly and inefficient to make much of an impact beyond the laboratory setting — according to Cody Schlenker, a fifth-year graduate student in Thompson’s lab, they are about a quarter as efficient as silicon-based cells.
“Our goal is to help develop solar cells that will make electricity that is cost-competitive with coal-powered plants,” Dapkus said.
A 10,000-sq. mile area covered by 40 percent efficiency solar cells could theoretically power the entire country, he added.
Schlenker, who will be graduating this year, hopes to take part in the early planning meetings. He is particularly interested in the collaborative efforts the center’s objectives will help foster, both within his department and between the others.
“It gives us a big opportunity to build a new collaborative effort in the chemistry department where we work together with different groups,” Schlenker said.
Separate from the EFRC, Dapkus will also direct the newly established Center for Energy Nanoscience and Technology, which will bring together researchers to devise new projects related to the university’s broader energy initiative.
Though it will primarily draw from researchers in engineering, physics and chemistry, Thompson, who will serve as CENT’s associate director, wants to attract a diverse array of faculty and students.
Ultimately, Dapkus and Thompson hope that the EFRC initiative, combined with the DoE’s other research programs, will rekindle the United States’ dormant energy research sector. Energy research in the U.S. has stagnated in recent decades as other countries, including China, Japan and Germany, have surged ahead.
While Thompson would like to see the federal government inject even more funds into this research, he said he is confident that he and his colleagues will quickly be able to make up for lost ground.

While universities nationwide admitted fewer international graduate students than last year, USC bucked the trend by significantly increasing it’s international graduate admissions rate.
On average, US graduate schools saw a 3 percent decrease in international student admissions — the first decrease since 2004, according to a Council of Graduate Schools report released this month.
Meanwhile, USC, which has the largest international graduate student population of any school in the country, saw a 13.7 percent spike in their admissions of international graduate students. The university currently enrolls graduate students from 114 different countries and international students account for more than a quarter of all graduate students at USC, according to the USC International Student Enrollment Report for 2008-2009.
According to CGS, the nationwide drop in international graduate student admissions comes at a time when application rates are not growing as quickly as they were prior to 2005.
One reason for the slowing growth may be the tough global economy, said Stuart Heiser, manager of government relations and external affairs for CGS. Heiser said some international students may be finding it difficult to afford undergraduate education in their home countries, so graduate education is no longer an option for them.
The largest drop in admissions to US graduate schools — 16 percent — occurred in students from India and South Korea, where finding loans has become increasingly difficult for prospective students, Heiser said.
Some countries, however, were immune to the drop. Graduate applications from China, for example, were up 14 percent from last year and admissions rates went up 13 percent.
Chansuk Jung, a first-year graduate student from South Korea, said he thinks the global economy isn’t affecting USC because students who apply to the university aren’t necessarily worried about finances.
He said he came to USC because he wanted to be in California, where a large percentage of Chinese and South Koreans who move to the US end up living. Jung said he was familiar with the university’s reputation, before he came to the US.
Katharine Harrington, the USC dean of admissions and financial aid, said she thought the importance the university has placed on bettering its
international presence has helped admissions rates continue to rise in light of the national drop.
“[The university] has made a significant commitment to maintaining an international presence,” Harrington said.
Harrington cited the university’s international offices as an example. Currently, USC has offices in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Mexico and Shanghai, with two more offices — one in India and one in South Korea — set to open later this academic year, according to a press release.
Krati Ahuja, a first-year graduate student from India studying computer science, said she came to USC because of its reputation.
“The school of engineering is very well-known and very reputable,” she said.
Jean Morrison, vice provost for academic affairs and graduate programs, said she thinks one possibility for the drop in admissions nationwide may be because of competition from graduate schools in other countries  that have started recruiting aggressively for international students.
But USC, Morrison said, has always outperformed other US universities in going after the best international students. She said she thinks that’s why its international admissions rates continued to rise.
“It’s a competitive market, and I think we have the structures in place to compete very effectively,” she said.

At just 24 years old, Los Angeles resident Sean Carlson has made quite the name for himself throughout the local underground music scene over the past several years — but not as a performer.
While most music-loving 20-somethings possess unrealistic dreams of lucrative recording contracts, Carlson took his appreciation for Los Angeles’ vibrant arts scene and turned it into something a rare few can pull off — a successful independent music festival.

Now in its sixth year, FYF Fest — formerly called F Yeah Fest — promises one of its largest and most ambitious lineups to date, adding art exhibitions, a variety of food vendors, a zine library and even a kissing booth in conjunction with the day’s 33 scheduled performances.
This Saturday, the festival moves several miles north of its usual indoors Echo Park locale to the Los Angeles State Historic Park in Downtown’s Chinatown neighborhood. In addition to a new name and a new venue, FYF Fest also seeks to bring awareness to the current condition of the state park system — a moved prompted by Carlson’s outrage against California’s recently proposed budget cuts.
“The main demographic [at the festival] is going to be between the ages of 18 to 30, and most of those people don’t know about the budget cuts,” Carlson said. “A lot of young people don’t follow up on the news — I’m not saying all of them, but a decent amount. I blame myself as well. But, if we can put on an event and put a cause behind it that we believe in — like the parks — that could help.”
Carlson organized the first incarnation of the event — a series of performances scattered throughout the Echo Park neighborhood — in 2004 when he was just 18 years old.
“I didn’t really know what I was doing,” he mused. “I asked a lot of my friends for help, we used smaller bands … It was something that was a bit unorganized and chaotic, but really fun at the same time.”
This did not mean, however, that Carlson’s first foray into the concert promotion world would be without  pitfalls. Carlson’s the first to admit that the inaugural festival was a “complete failure.”
“Even though 2,000 people showed up, I decided to make [the concert] free and I think I walked away with about $4,” Carlson said. “The next year, we decided to charge $6. It went over really well, and it kind of grew from there … It was just this natural progression of growing from a grassroots punk festival into an event that was actually something.”
As time passed, the festival — still bearing the name F Yeah Fest — evolved from a local, underground secret into a nationally recognized event known for discovering and promoting a colorful assortment of independent musicians who would eventually become synonymous with the country’s burgeoning pop scene.
Yet for all of the indie-world notables peppering this year’s FYF Fest lineup, Carlson is quick to dismiss notions that he and his fellow festival organizers are hip, Pitchfork-savvy tastemakers.
“I’m not going to say, ‘Oh, we’re ahead of the curve!’ But there’s definitely a few bands that break out every year after the festival,” he said, citing performers such as Los Angeles darlings No Age and Memphis’ Jay Reatard, who found considerable successes in the years following their appearances at Carlson’s event.
“There’s always a few bands on the bill that no one has heard of at the time,” Carlson said.” That’s what’s really important to us — bringing in these smaller bands and giving them the opportunity to play.”
Saturday’s lineup includes a wide variety of musical genres, ranging from hardcore punk bands (Fucked Up, Converge), electronica-driven acts (Glass Candy, Telepathe) and experimentally bent groups (Lightning Bolt). A handful of key players in the independent music world — such as Dan Deacon, Wavves and Black Lips — are also scheduled to perform.
“We may not have mega headliners like the Flaming Lips or Grizzly Bear or MIA,” Carlson noted, speaking of successful performers within the greater indie contingent. “But we have some very well known, very well respected bands. We tried to make the lineup as eclectic as possible; we are flying bands in from all over the country that people don’t necessarily know of.”
And while annual music festivals with similar lineups — for instance, the Pitchfork Music Festival and the Coachella Valley Music and Art Festival — charge as much as $100 for a day pass, attendees of FYF Fest can delight in the fact that tickets to Saturday’s event remain notably inexpensive: pre-purchased tickets are $20, while those purchased at the door will cost $25.
Carlson cites his admiration of legendary punk band Fugazi’s infamous $5 ticket prices as the inspiration for FYF’s affordability.
“Everyone’s broke — but I want people to go out and enjoy themselves. It’s Labor Day weekend, but you might not have the money to travel … I have [Fugazi’s] ethic — I don’t want to charge a lot of money because if it was $40 or $50, I wouldn’t go. I don’t want to put on a show that I wouldn’t attend,” Carlton said.
Despite the large amount of publicity and buzz surrounding this year’s FYF Fest, Carlson’s hopes for the event remain as humble as they were in 2004.
“I really encourage students who are just looking for something to do, who don’t want to go to a frat party or sit in the dorms or wander around Figueroa to come do this,” Carlson said, beaming. “I love it when there’s people [at the event] who don’t know what to expect because it’s all a mystery to them. That makes it so much better.”
And Carlson’s advice for FYF Fest newbies unfamiliar with the lineup?
“Pick and see bands you’ve never ever heard of,” he explained. “That’s the whole point — walk around, check out a new band, have some ice cream, hang out, have a good time.”

Iran was front and center in the news this summer. The aftermath of the June 12 national elections put the Islamic Republic’s dismal human rights practices in the international spotlight. Prior to the election debacle, when most Americans thought of Iran they were reminded of the anti-Semitic speeches by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the government’s nuclear ambitions, its duplicitous and destabilizing machinations in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere in the Middle East, and its use of oil as a coercive geopolitical bargaining chip.
The aforementioned features of the Islamic Republic’s foreign policy are unacceptable and dangerous, and have been scrutinized extensively by Western media and governments. But until the recent farce of an election and the subsequent outburst of protest on the part of a beleaguered and stifled Iranian populace, the theocracy’s domestic persecutions and injustices were not examined and brought to light to a sufficient degree by the outside world.
Now, the world has seen the cruelty, barbarism and backwardness of a regime that has a distinguished record of paranoia, mismanagement, hypocrisy and corruption. Since the revolution that toppled the Shah in 1979, one group in particular has borne the brunt of the regime’s prejudice and hostility. As the largest religious minority in Iran, numbering some 300,000 people, the Baha’i group members in Iran have suffered a disproportionate share of the scapegoating that has become a hallmark of the Islamic Republic.
According to the regime, the Baha’is — whose core beliefs include noninvolvement in politics, respect for one’s government, a commitment to the elimination of all forms of prejudice, equality for women and men and the oneness of God — are spies for Israel, the United States and Britain. The regime claims the Baha’is are campaigning for the downfall of the Iranian government and the moral fiber of the Iranian public. Each of these claims is not only patently false and fabricated, but outrageous considering what the Baha’i faith stands for.
Prior to the 1979 revolution, the Baha’is formed a significant proportion of the professional class (far higher than the less than 1 percent of the general population indicated) and made lasting contributions to the progress of the Iranian nation.
Then, in a bout of bigoted and ignorant fury, the Islamic revolutionaries and extremists who formed the current regime launched a devastating and systematic persecution of the innocent Baha’i community. More than 200 prominent Baha’is were executed, thousands more were imprisoned and tortured without due process and tens of thousands were fired from their jobs or had their pensions suspended.
To this day, Baha’is are not allowed to pursue a university education and some are expelled from high school. The Iranian Baha’i community, both nationally and locally, is not allowed to hold meetings, commemorate Baha’i holidays, own or rent Baha’i centers or have any sort of organized administrative structure. Perhaps most devastating, dozens of priceless Baha’i historical sites, properties and shrines have been destroyed and taken by the government since 1979. Essentially, the regime has systematically attempted to destroy the historical and cultural roots of the Baha’i community.
Encouragingly, the international community and individual national governments, led by the UN General Assembly, the US Congress and the British Parliament, have issued numerous resolutions and condemnations of the Iranian government’s persecution of the Baha’is and other religious minorities, expressing “deep concern at serious human rights violations” in Iran.
Until June’s “election” and the chaotic aftermath, the Baha’is, along with Israel and America, had served as the convenient scapegoats for Iran’s pressing domestic problems — including anemic economic growth, high drug addiction and prostitution rates, income inequality and socioeconomic stratification. Now that there is a critical mass of people in Iran who are demanding accountability and freedom of thought from its government, it is extremely difficult for the leadership within the Islamic Republic to distract the general population by blaming the Baha’is and the United States for the internal upheavals fracturing the country.
That, however, won’t stop them from trying. Currently, the seven-member group (five men and two women) known as the “Friends in Iran,” who unofficially helped administer the affairs of the Iranian Baha’i community, have been held for well over a year in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison; their trial has been postponed multiple times.
Because of the unprecedented attention given to Iran’s human rights record in the post-election period, American and European news organizations are finally paying due attention to this absurdity masquerading as legal process.
The events of this summer amply illustrated that the extremists running Iran are not only a threat to other countries in the Middle East and beyond, but that they are also a constant and pernicious insult to their own people. They have relegated a nation — with a rich history and civilization, tremendous oil and mineral wealth, and the most educated and entrepreneurial population in the entire region — to international and economic isolation, economic and social stagnation, and a toxic trauma to the national psyche as a result of their Orwellian rule.
In the end, however, as history has demonstrated countless times, tyrants and authoritarians are eventually vanquished and discarded. So while persecution of Iranian Baha’is and other helpless citizens continues unabated, I tell my brothers and sisters in Iran to hang in there, know that there are millions of people around the world who are pulling for them and, most importantly, to always remember that injustice is unsustainable.

Academy Award-winning film director Roman Polanski has had a turbulent life, and that’s not considering the last 31 years he has been living as a fugitive of California state law.
Polanski’s troubles started long before he pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977 and subsequently fled the United States a year later to live in exile in France. He’s had to endure many traumatic events, including his mother’s death at the hands of the Nazis, his escape from a concentration camp and the murder of his pregnant wife Sharon Tate by the Manson Family in 1969.

The director, whose films include Chinatown and Rosemary’s Baby was finally arrested  in Zurich, Switzerland on Sept. 26   for unlawful sex with a minor — a criminal charge he admitted to years ago — while on his way to attend an award ceremony.
It appears now, after his prolonged arrest, that Polanski may indeed come face-to-face with the trouble he has been avoiding for decades; he may be extradited to Los Angeles, where he will face charges of statutory rape.
In the years since the rape took place, the victim, Samantha Geimer, reached a private settlement with the director and vocalized her wishes that all charges against Polanski be dropped.
This stipulation, as well as the time period in which the director has been living and working as a fugitive, has prompted quite a debate over exactly how Polanski’s case should be handled. As a result, the director has many supporters, but also a great deal who oppose him.
Several prominent Hollywood figures such as Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen and Harvey Weinstein have all aligned in protest, which includes the signing of a petition that states, “Filmmakers in France, in Europe, in the United States and around the world are dismayed by this decision.”
Hollywood is not the only outlet expressing concern and support for Polanski. Members of the French and Polish governments have also made their defense of the director quite prominent. Polanski’s colleagues and admirers have stressed the notion of his arrest as a deliberate attack on the artist that should, after more than 30 years, be put to rest.
The director’s opposition certainly does not have the overwhelming star power that his defense does, but it is making just as much noise as Polanski’s supporters.
The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, which issued the warrant for Polanski’s arrest, as well as many feminist groups and several Hollywood players — most of who have stayed somewhat silent in their opinions — are among many who seek justice for the crime Polanski committed years ago.
Many believe the overall debate merely concerns the treatment of Polanski now and during the last 30 years, with no regard for the crime he committed. The crime itself has been taken aside to make room for the director’s reputation and presence around the world. It is this very fact that many who oppose Polanski find utterly disturbing.
While Hollywood and other European filmmakers believe the charges to be nothing more than “a so-called crime,” according to Weinstein, many others believe the director’s possible acquittal to be a blatant disregard of moral values and established laws.
The basic concern: How far can celebrities go to avoid legal incrimination? Many see a dismissal of Polanski’s charges as a solidification of the power of celebrity.
The troubling part is that this heated debated may be difficult to put to rest. The US Department of Justice has up to 60 days to request an extradition and, if Polanski refuses, the legal proceedings could easily continue for months.
He has continued to direct films, most notably 2002’s The Pianist, for which he won the Academy Award for Best Director. He did not attend the ceremony, but still received a modest-sized standing ovation.
He also has a new film in production, but its future, like Polanski’s, is also now very uncertain.
As one side asks why now, after 30 years, others express satisfaction for an arrest finally taking place. No matter what happens with his case, it is certain Polanski will, once again, not be able to avoid traumatic events.
Polanski has the right to make any and all of those arguments in his defense — in court! Skipping the country on the eve of sentencing, because you think you might not like the sentence, is not a legitimate defense. By the way, did anyone mention the part about Polanski drugging, raping, and sodomizing a 13-year-old? Why would you even want to make excuses for him?
Mr. Clark,
Polanski served the time ordered per his plea bargain. When he caught wind that the media-motivated judge was going to sentence him to longer time, e fled.
Also, Mr. Clark, the victim has stated she feels it’s time to move on and she does not desire to press charges.
Wow, Poor Roman has sure had a tragic life. Let’s all feel sorry for him!
I see that you’re trying to give the impression of covering both sides of the story, but your bias (or the bias of your information sources) is clear. Nowhere in the article do you mention the incident that absolutely crucial to understanding this controversy: in 1977, Roman Polanski drugged, forcibly raped, and sodomized a 13-year-old girl against her vocal protestations. Let me state that again. In 1977, Roman Polanski drugged, forcibly raped, and sodomized a 13-year-old girl against her vocal protestations.
This is not a case of a handful of prudes staging a 30-year witch hunt against a misunderstood Frenchman with a misunderstood love affair. It’s a case of a monster getting away with rape, being glorified by his peers for it, and being inexplicably defended by the European and American left for over 30 years.

2009-10-08,USC,China,"America is facing a crucial crisis of leadership that could alter the country’s future, acclaimed political expert David Gergen told students and faculty at Bovard Auditorium Thursday, calling on audience members to embrace their roles as decision-making citizens.
Gergen, who has been an adviser to four presidents and is currently the editor-at-large at US News & World Report and a political analyst at CNN, was speaking as part of The President’s Distinguished Artist And Lecture Series. After being introduced by USC President Steven B. Sample, Gergen spoke to the audience about the impending restructuring of global dynamics.
Into the future · David Gergen, who held positions in the Reagan, Nixon, Ford and Clinton administrations, spoke Thursday about America’s crisis of leadership and its potential impact. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“The issue for us is, when the great nations of the world are sitting around the power tables 25 years from now — China will be there, India will be there, Japan could be there — will America be there? Will we be at the head of the table?” Gergen said.
Referencing influential historical figures from Winston Churchill to Franklin D. Roosevelt, Gergen told the audience about the importance of determined leadership and how strong personalities can shape the future of an organization, whether university or a nation.
“Individuals matter. Leadership matters and the quality of the leadership is the ‘X-factor’ in so many organizations,” Gergen said. “We need to think about that as a society, as we think about where this nation is going.”
As a political expert who has lived through 10 elections, Gergen said he had seen the country through a number of ups and downs, and understood the irrational fear that many in the United States felt after the economic crash. But, Gergen added, the relative improvement since last year doesn’t mean the country is already on the right track.
“We are no longer heading over the cliff,” he said. “[But] that does not mean we’re going to return to the way it was before.”
Speaking about conversations he had with analysts both at his television job and as a professor at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, Gergen said America would have to focus on tackling its biggest issues over the next few years, rather than leaving the problems for future generations.
“We haven’t had the kind of leadership we need to build a sturdy future,” Gergen said. “The truth is we haven’t faced up to our biggest problems.”
Specifically naming education, health care and energy as the most crucial issues of the time, Gergen said a large part of dealing with these issues would fall on the shoulders of President Obama, who won last year’s vote on a campaign of hope and promise.
“Doubts are setting in about whether he is this great president that we all thought he was,” Gergen said. “He is having a hard time making the transition from campaigner to chief executive.”
Gergen said Obama’s need to split the difference rather than take a stand on every polarizing issue, from health care to Afghanistan, could affect his ability to succeed as a president as well as set the tone for the nation in the 21st century.
“There are areas in public life where you have to make a tough decision, where you have to get it done. There are times where you have to lead from the front,” Gergen said. “Time is not our friend now.”
Many members in the audience said they were impressed by Gergen’s speech and appreciated his nuanced comments about leadership in the United States.
“I thought he was incredible … especially his insight into the intellect of a leader,” said Walter Ponce, 27, a resident of Los Angeles. “It was also interesting that he hinted at the malaise settling into the country after the past few years of, what I call American imperialism.”
Katey Finnegan, a sophomore majoring in international relations, said she felt Gergen’s comments about the president were very fair, even though he was coming from a different point of view.
“It was interesting, I liked how he noted what he liked about Obama, and also gave constructive criticism,” Finnegan said. “I also think it was very important that our leaders have to go beyond just doing their jobs and encourage others to lead.”
In concluding his speech, Gergen underscored what he felt was the importance of leadership for the country, by insisting that tough decisions don’t only fall to the people in power, in boardrooms or in the media.
“To leave it on the president is not enough,” Gergen said. “Our future rests incredibly on the quality of our citizenship, those who are not in the White House, those not in the studios. This is a bottom-up society.”
He has always been a trader
Didn’t Gergen also and more importantly say that if we continue down our present path that the standard of living of our grandchildren will decrease by 25%?

The USC US-China Institute is set to contribute to the bilateral discourse between the United States and China by hosting a delegation of high-level Chinese government officials for a daylong Legal Exchange focusing on Chinese telecommunications and patent law, on campus Monday.
The US-China Legal Exchange is an annual summit hosted in alternating years in the United States or China, that gives representatives from both countries an opportunity to clarify and discuss legal issues from their respective nations. This year, the USC US-China Institute will host the Los Angeles portion of the exchange at the Davidson Conference Center.
“The most important part of the Legal Exchange is that it promotes dialogue and provides an opportunity for direct contact between legal and academic communities with foreign government officials,” said Joel Blank, senior attorney for the Office of the Chief Counsel for International Commerce, who is involved in organizing the exchange.
The Chinese delegation, led by Vice Minister Zhang Qiong from China’s State Council Legislative Affairs Office, will use this year’s exchange to focus on amendments to the Chinese patent law and explain the details of the draft of the Chinese telecommunications law for American service providers and manufacturers who are interested in the Chinese market.
“They are trying to structure this in a way they can attract foreign technology, investment, cooperation and build their own capacity for their domestic market,” said Clayton Dube, associate director of the USC US-China Institute.
Dube added that the event was an opportunity for people from both countries to clarify and learn more about the legal technicalities of their individual legal systems, rather than approach the markets without any knowledge.
“This is not intended to be a debate,” Dube said. “The reason the [Chinese] Ministry of Commerce and US Department of Commerce is putting to this together is because they want greater discussion and understanding.”
The US Department of Commerce asked the institute to be a co-host for the Legal Exchange, in part because of its research which focus on trends that could affect the US-China relationship, rather than generally topical issues, according to Dube.
“We invite people here, send people there, and that kind of back and forth is essential,” Dube said. “If you are only talking about other people, you can get a lot of things wrong. Talking [directly] with people can really help you understand them.”
Blank added that he had identified the institute as an entity in the Los Angeles area with expertise in US-China relations that would also be a good place to hold an event like the Exchange.
“They will help draw experts to the program that are in the academic and non-academic community,” Blank said.
He added that the attendance by the institute’s faculty and students would be beneficial because they can bring their own expertise to the program as well.
The event will feature a number of experts, ranging from lawyers, academic professors and even company representatives to comment on Chinese law and American involvement in the Chinese market, including USC professor Simon Wilkie, an expert on cable, Internet and wireless communications.
According to Dube, the Exchange is just one of the ways  the Institute adds to the national conversation about the bilateral relationship between the two countries, he said. Events like this offer students and faculty a different way of approaching their research.
Ying Jia Huang, a senior majoring in international relations and history who is a student assistant at the Institute, said events like the Exchange provides an opportunity to learn much more about the two countries’ policies than she would have sitting in a classroom.
“You get to meet people who put the policies together, wrote these books, write these articles we read on JSTOR,” Huang said. “The degree of relevance is much more significant than reading through textbooks.”
Following the Exchange in Los Angeles, the Chinese delegation will travel to Chicago and New York City, where they will present more information on the Chinese legal system to local businesses and legal and academic communities.

David Huebner, a USC lecturer at the Gould School of Law, has been nominated as the new US Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa by President Barack Obama.
A member of the Sheppard Mullin & Richter LLP law firm, Huebner is no stranger to international affairs.  He currently resides in Shanghai as a partner resident, and he heads the firm’s China Practice and International Disputes Practice.
Though Huebner has not been at USC for the last two years, his involvement with Gould has had a lasting effect, said Deborah Call, associate dean at the law school.
“He helped us when we began our [Master of Laws] program,” Call said.  “He introduced us to a network of high power attorneys to promote our program and attracted a great number of students into our program from the Asia-Pacific region.”
Huebner is also general counsel for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, has previously chaired the California Law Revision Commission and served as president of the Los Angeles Quality and Productivity Commission.
Brian Hebert, a member of the CLRC who worked with Huebner, spoke highly of his time as chair.
“He was an excellent commissioner,” Hebert said.  “The work we do is complicated legal analysis and he was always very well prepared.  As a chair, he was very effective and good at keeping everyone on task.”
Hebert said he thinks Huebner will do will in his new role as ambassador.
“He makes people from different backgrounds feel included and heard,” Hebert said.  “I think that’s important in a diplomatic position.”
Call also thinks Huebner will have a lot to bring to the table as an ambassador.
“What he offers is not only depth of experience as a seasoned attorney, but he’s very familiar and well traveled,” Call said.  “His expertise in international affairs, his work as an educator, and all of that combined will bring a lot to his position as an ambassador.”

“We have a great opportunity to have him work and teach here,” Call said.  “I think it will enhance the relationships [USC] seeks with global partners around the world.”

In an effort to close the cultural gap between international and domestic students and to introduce the student body to cultural diversity on campus, the International Student Assembly is hosting USC’s first Multicultural Carnival Saturday in McCarthy Quad.
With the largest number of international students of any university in the United States, USC has 41 countries represented in its student body.

But, many of those students struggle with adapting to the social and cultural gaps between international and domestic students, according to Eshan Saluja, director of programming and development for ISA.
“I think there is a huge gap between international students and domestic students,” said Saluja, a junior majoring in business administration. “Even though USC has the largest international population, the problem is that there is not that much interaction apart from class or group work. Americans hang out with Americans, Chinese with Chinese and Indian with Indian.”
ISA is hoping the carnival, slated to run from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., will serve as a jumping-off point for students from different cultures to interact with one another. The carnival will include booths from different international student organizations on campus, featuring culture-specific activities such as a chopstick game with the Chinese Students Association, as well as samples of the country’s cuisine.
“We are trying to encourage the connection between different nationality groups … including domestic students,” said Matthew Leung, executive director of the ISA and a sophomore majoring in business finance.
The Carnival will feature international activities, and also some traditionally American pastimes.
Leung said the ISA is hoping to attract even more visitors to the carnival by broadcasting the USC-Notre Dame game on a high-definition TV.
“We are trying to see if we can incorporate American culture with the different international games so we don’t involve only international students and so we can attract domestic students,” he said. “Also, international students can learn about football, which is an American experience as well as a Trojan experience.”
A number of students planning to participate in the event said they are looking forward to a chance to promote their own culture.
“Apart from wanting to get to know other cultures, we want to tell other people about our culture,” said Silviana Hurniawan, a junior majoring in communication and the public relations officer for the Association of Indonesian Students. “Apart from the disaster, I don’t think anybody has any idea of what Indonesian culture is like.”
Others are hoping the carnival will help integrate international and domestic students on campus.
“There is a disconnect. Even though I feel like people are trying to push us together, there is a still a gap,” said Siyucu Fan, a junior from China who is majoring in design. “[But] I think the carnival will be good. It’s a good way to introduce cultures.”
The turnout and success of the carnival — ISA is hoping to get around 1,000 attendees — will determine whether it will become a tradition, Leung said.
“It’s amazing the opportunity our domestic students have to get to know and experience so many countries represented here at USC,” Becky Peterson, an international student advisor at the Office of International Services, wrote in an email.

One of the highest aspirations of a filmmaker is to hear that his or her film is “refreshing.”
There is something about the novelty of exploring old archetypes, familiar places and tired stories from previously unprivileged perspectives that leaves us intoxicated by what we are seeing. We can almost feel the synapses from disparate regions of consciousness springing into being, bridging the gaps in our understanding of the world and forcing onto the momentary realization that there is something in the world to be probed beyond the scope of our own experience.
Stop and stare · Paris, Je T’aime producer Emmanuel Benbihy followed up his 2007 compilation of romantic vignettes with New York, I Love You, a series of short segments about those searching for love in New York City. Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf and Orlando Bloom are among the film’s cast. - Photo courtest of 42 West
Emmanuel Benbihy, producer of New York, I Love You, knows this. Rather than enlist the aid of the Hollywood heavyweights to fabricate some no-doubt-wonderful-but-all-too-predictable vignettes for the second in his series of films about the spectrum of love in the “mythic cities” of the world, he stayed true to his Paris, Je T’aime mentality, synthesizing the narratives of relative newcomers to the cinematic conversation. Along with fellow producer Marina Grasic (of Crash fame), Benhiby hired 11 young directors — including actress Natalie Portman — to canvas the neighborhoods of the Big Apple and paint the portraits of love in its varied states.
At the film’s outset, the information we receive as viewers is the same worn-out set of clichés we have always heard applied to New York City: New York is overcast, New York is full of pigeons, New York has many cabs, and it is difficult to get one of these cabs to stop for you.
But by the time two of the film’s central characters (if any characters can be called central in a piece that intertwines 11 stories in a way that emphasizes their equal importance) incidentally hop into the same taxi and deliberate over the best route to take to their destination so animatedly that the driver shoos them from the Plexiglas-encased backseat with jaggedly inflected shouts, we are already waving goodbye to the territory of anecdotal moviemaking.
The subsequent short films pair box office staples in addition to Portman, like Hayden Christensen, Rachel Bilson, Orlando Bloom, Christina Ricci, Shia LaBeouf and Chris Cooper with the unestablished filmmakers.
With audiences being led through the lives of an orthodox Jew on the day of her wedding and an older, Middle Eastern diamond salesman who simultaneously fantasize about marrying one another, a high school guy’s unique “first time” involving a tree on prom night in Central Park, a cardiovascularly unsound artist whose prime model eludes him in her Chinatown shop, and an elderly couple on the day of their anniversary — there is definitely something that will strike a chord.
Though the stories are truly powered by raw emotions, that is not to say that they’re not up for interpretation; while one audience member laughs outright at a middle-aged stranger’s unabashedly graphic description of what he would do to ensure that a woman achieve a full-blown orgasm, another will slouch down and cringe in discomfort.
In a later narrative, the same couple is seen through the window of a passing cab, and viewers won’t be able to keep from smirking with the knowledge that their ordinary-appearing interaction is actually an elaborate sexual advance.
Such brief glimpses into the lives of other characters whose love stories come to fruition in other parts of the film are the exact reason that Benhiby wanted Grasic on board. He, like so many others in the cinematic community, was riveted by the interwoven narratives of Crash, which communicated to audience members a coherent thesis about race and identity in Los Angeles. Benhiby’s tapestry of stories creates a similarly rich viewing experience, but it also fails in similar ways.
Unlike the organic tone set by his first opus for the many ways we love in a mystic city, New York, I Love You feels forced. Instances of transcendent amusement, sadness and revulsion are somewhat occluded by the ever-present hand of the production team as it pounds us over the head chanting, “We are all connected! We all love, and we all live in the same world!”
And yet, for all that they emphasize the singleness of experience and of setting in the stories, New York, I Love You also loses something very central to the idea of Paris, Je T’aime and Benhiby’s series in general: the notion of the city itself as a character. For as often as we see the New York skyline, hear the distinct accents of the five boroughs and sample an ethnically diverse cast, these stories still feel like they could have taken place in any city and it would hardly have made a difference. A pity for a city that has been reduced to stereotypes for so long and could stand to feel “refreshed.”

A record number of USC students have submitted applications for the 2010-2011 Fulbright  program, which awards grants to students looking to go abroad to teach, learn or perform research.
This year, 63 USC students applied, according to Noosha Malek, USC’s Fulbright Program adviser. That’s 12 more than last year’s total, and more than double the number from just three years ago.
Bright ideas · Melissa Norman, a student worker for Academic Recognition Programs, sorts through the record 63 Fulbright applications sent in by USC students this year. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
“Students can do anything from design an independent research project, pursue graduate study at a university, study at a conservatory, produce a documentary or teach English,” Malek said. “As long as the proposed project is academic in nature and specific to the country of application, they can pursue it. That openness is the beauty of the Fulbright program.”
The application process is intense. Applicants must start two months before the deadline, and their proposals undergo heavy review.
Still, USC’s application numbers continue to increase, a rise Malek attributed to USC’s success in the application process. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, USC was one of last year’s top Fulbright producers, earning eight grants.
“Success breeds success,” Malek said. “Students hear about their peers getting these awards and feel they have a chance too.”
Despite the school’s past success with the Fulbright program, Malek said it’s difficult to estimate how many grants USC will be awarded this year.
“The number does fluctuate,” Malek said. “There are many factors at play.”
The strength of a student’s application is important, Malek said, but sometimes the popularity of the country they are applying to can be just as important.
Last year, 405 students nationwide applied for grants to go to the United Kingdom but only 13 grants were awarded. On the other hand, 54 students applied to go to Korea and 15 received grants.
“The message is not for students to avoid a country because of the numbers, but to be aware that competition is a factor,” Malek said.
Jeanette Acosta, a 2008 USC graduate, applied to the Fulbright Program last year and received a grant to perform research in Mexico.
Acosta said she had known about the Fulbright program for a while, but did not consider it until later in her academic career.
“By the time I was a senior, my friend got a Fulbright,” Acosta said. “Knowing someone made it more tangible and real, I asked myself, ‘Why didn’t I give it a try?’ And it was worth it.”
She is currently in Mexico at the Universidad Autónoma de Zacatecas studying how education among children affects migration.
Jack Tseng, a graduate student working on his Ph.D. in biology, received a Fulbright grant that allowed him to travel to China in 2008 to go to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and do hands-on paleontology work with Chinese fossils.
“I’d always wanted to spend time abroad because it would broaden my education,” Tseng said. “It didn’t come through as a possibility until the Fulbright.”
Unlike most Fulbright grants, Tseng’s wasn’t for a social or political science.
“They don’t usually fund science projects,” Tseng said. “But I really needed to be there to see the material if I wanted to do anything with it. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without the grant.”
Tseng and Acosta agreed applying to the Fulbright Program was the right decision.
“It’s a long process with lots of steps but it’s worth it,” Acosta said. “It’s always worth applying and putting the best application forward if you’re really passionate about something.”

USC deans, professors and faculty traveled to Taipei, Taiwan this week to meet with USC alumni from across Asia and discuss global issues at the three-day USC Global Conference, which begins Thursday.
The Global Conference, organized by the USC Office of Globalization, is held in a different part of Asia every other year and consists of three days of speeches and panel discussions about issues including health, energy, business and digital media.
“It’s all intertwined,” said Adam Powell, the USC vice provost for globalization and this year’s emcee for the conference. “The discussions are interdisciplinary.”
The conference acts as a showcase for the latest work from USC’s faculty and researchers, as well as a networking forum for alumni in Asia.
One of the main goals of the event is something that Powell calls “friend raising” — strengthening ties among the Trojan Family as well as building relationships with people from the country where the conference is being held.
“USC wants to reach out with its alumni, so we’re looking for the topics that will be important to them,” said Dr. Jonathan Samet, the director of USC Institute for Global Health, who will be one of the speakers at the Global Conference. “We want to engage the alumni and others in something that will make a difference.”
According to Powell, the conference is also a useful opportunity for the university to build contacts in the region.
“[We get] more research partnerships, opportunities for student internships in Asia, and greater activity overall,” Powell said. “We’re connecting with partners in different universities, government, industry, and we’re increasing opportunities in internships.”
The Global Conference was first held nine years ago in Hong Kong as a Marshall School reunion. Since then, it has developed and grown into a gathering for all of USC’s schools.
“We wanted to make it more of a platform for USC to do its best, and to do that we had to make it interdisciplinary,” Powell said.
The conference is always held in Asia, demonstrating the university’s commitment to the region, said Jeffrey Cole, the director of USC’s Center for the Digital Future.
“The future rests strongly on Asia, and this is an opportunity for USC to showcase cutting-edge work done on its campus,” said Cole, who is a speaker at the conference.
As part of the conference, Samet will be leading a discussion on global health issues focusing on global epidemics from H1N1 to SARS. Cole plans to speak about the changes coming from traditional media and the future of music, newspapers and television.
Other panels, which draw from speakers across the region as well as USC deans and faculty, will touch on topics including the changing economic climate and the global outlook for energy.
The event is entirely set up by USC, drawing on organization from a number of USC offices, including the USC office in Taipei, and is primarily attended by alumni in the region.
“Each of the individuals coming pays hundreds just to register,” Powell said. “USC doesn’t make any money, but they only lose a little. Attendance is so good this year we might not lose anything.”
Powell said more than 600 people were willing to pay for registration and hotel fares for this year’s conference, up from the 450 who attended in 2007. The uptick has caused organizers to consider looking for a larger venue for future conferences.
“It’s been quite a surprise, especially because of the global economy. We expected it to go down… Alumni are simply coming out in larger numbers,” Powell said. “It’s proven more successful than anyone imagined.”
According to Clayton Dube, the associate director of the USC US-China Institute, the record attendance may be partly due to the fact that the region is the home to the largest percentage of USC’s current foreign students. Currently, 1,187 students from China, 625 students from Taiwan and 244 students from Hong Kong and Macau attend USC.
Cole said the conference is ultimately more than just a get-together for alumni and Asian leaders.
“The Global Conference energizes the USC community,” Cole said. “It demonstrates that USC isn’t just a school. It has become a global entity.”

“No matter what you do, make sure that you have a good time,” indie folk-rocker Devendra Banhart said last Thursday during a party celebrating the release of his seventh album, What Will We Be.
Discreetly located on the second floor of a Chinatown restaurant, the apartment previously known as Madame Wong’s is a former concert hot spot known to some as LA’s version of CBGB’s. Madame Wong’s became famous in the ’70s and ’80s for bringing in such acts as The Pretenders, The Ramones and Oingo Boingo to LA audiophiles.
Freak-folk · Devendra Banhart performed songs off his latest album, What Will We Be, last Thursday in Chinatown. A distinguished member of LA’s underground music community, Banhart’s audience consisted of mostly friends and family, including actress Kat Dennings and musician Fabrizio Moretti. - Scott Melendez | Daily Trojan
Thursday night, however, Banhart and his crew of sombrero-wearing psych-folk compadres decorated the recently converted two-story townhouse with skull-shaped piñatas, ice tubs full of free cerveza, dark-red lighting and endless trays of enchiladas and churros to give the celebration a timely Dia de los Muertos theme.
Different from most big-time indie-rock shows, the audience at Madame Wong’s was a small crowd of Banhart’s friends and family, including actress Kat Dennings, who stood in the front row, tapping her feet as marionette shadows danced across the walls, and Strokes drummer Fabrizio Moretti, who performed as a guest musician in Banhart’s band.
A visual artist, poet, singer-songwriter and occasional actor, Banhart’s personality is an exact reflection of his musical style — friendly and genuine, but mysteriously difficult to diagnose — making this exclusive live concert an ethereal experience. It’s one grounded in reality but high enough to scrape the dew off a Venezuelan rainbow.
Born in Los Angeles but raised in Venezuela until the age of 14, Banhart attended the San Francisco Art Institute, but his artistic journey entailed getting as far away from the rules as possible.
“In college, they’d tell me to paint pictures a certain way, make art a certain way and get rid of my own personal style, and that’s when I knew I had to get out,” he said in a quiet booth at Footsies, a hole-in-the-wall bar located a few miles north of Chinatown, where Banhart held his after-party.
After performing music on the streets and at small venues in the Castro district, Banhart decided to pursue his musical interests full-time and played concerts throughout the United States and Europe. His first six albums consisted of innovative musical combinations using rustic string instruments, raspy vocals and dreamy poetry. Success with these new sounds ultimately mounted Banhart as the poster child for New Weird America, a recently established musical subgenre also known as freak-folk or, as Banhart describes it, “naturalisimo.”
In the last few years, however, Banhart’s fame has spiked with art exhibitions, bit roles in studio films, musical contributions to TV commercials and a brief relationship with actress Natalie Portman — it’s no wonder he feels resistant to becoming a sellout. But although Banhart has a lot more exposure on the horizon — including songs on Todd Solondz’s upcoming Life During Wartime soundtrack and a featured spot on a Beck-compiled compilation of Leonard Cohen covers — he remains optimistic.
“College is very important,” Banhart said. “I left the institution, but I kept the connections I found there and have benefited from them to this day.”
Dennings agrees with this statement, as she swoops into the booth and whispers something into his ear every few minutes. A longtime friend of his, Dennings and Banhart shared the silver screen together in the film Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist, and continue to stay in touch. Concerning Banhart’s new album, Dennings adds that it’s “like unicorns dipped in chocolate.”
Banhart, however, isn’t too quick to praise his new work.
“My new album isn’t completely honest,” Banhart admitted after Moretti poured him a shot of tequila. “Even though it focuses on updating different genres, it’s not totally me.”
Despite Banhart’s sentiments toward the album, the 14-track What Will We Be is already getting rave reviews and is sure to propel Banhart even further up the ladder of important folk artists of our generation. The album mixes elements of R&B, bluegrass and Latin musical styles, and has an effervescent, friendly mood to it — much like the atmosphere Banhart has created for his guests Thursday night.
As the after-party wound down and Banhart headed off to a much more exclusive after-after-party, he made sure to write down a list of his favorite films and TV shows, taking contributions from Dennings, Moretti and other friends — in hopes of inspiring college students to follow in his footsteps and relish in the “naturalisimo.”

The USC College Republicans’ decision to bring David Horowitz, a conservative writer and activist, to campus sparked controversy from the moment it was announced, but the outcry ramped up this week when some students were denied admission to tonight’s event.
The College Republicans, who are hosting the private event, are denying admission to around 30 students affiliated with specific student organizations, including Students for Justice in Palestine and the Progressive Alliance. Alexa Ekman, president of the USC College Republicans, said the group decided to ban certain students because they were worried about potential protests.
Ekman said the College Republicans has obtained copies of emails that made the organization feel there was a real danger of physical or verbal protest by members of SJP and other groups during the event.
Ekman wouldn’t say exactly why she believed a protest might ensue. She did, however, reference an Facebook message that was sent to members of SJP from the group’s president, Alex Shams.
The email tells SJP members, “The fact that a USC student group is bringing this kind of racist trash to speak at our school is absolutely unacceptable, and it is up to us as students to resist it. Students for Justice in Palestine has voted to oppose this speaker in any way possible, and I am now calling on you to help us figure out how to respond.”
In light of this message, Ekman said College Republicans was concerned.
“We’re worried about our event and the people attending and our speaker,” Ekman said. “We do have reason to believe that there is a threat of opposition, whether it is by words or via violence.”
Shams, a senior majoring in international relations, said he is angry about the choice of speaker because of Horowitz’s conservative principles, which often target Islam.
“Right now, the USC College Republicans is bringing a man who is a very vocal and famous racist and Islamophobe who has in the past come to campuses across the country and targeted students in a similar way with his hate speech,” he said.
But no verbal or physical protest was ever planned, Shams said.
“That protest wasn’t supposed to disruptive at all. It was supposed to be silent,” he said.
Leena Ali, a second-year neuroscience Ph.D. student and a member of SJP, said only a silent protest was planned.
“We weren’t going to shout anything; we were going to get up and turn our backs,” she said.
But Ekman insisted there was a real threat of a protest at the event.
“They have shown active involvement in preparation to protest our speaker, and [we] feel that the reasons above justify their denial to our event,” Ekman wrote in an email.
She emphasized, however, that it is not the protest that concerns USC College Republicans, but the way in which it might be conducted.
“We are fine with their protest,” she said. “We welcome their opinions and ideas, [but] not to the speaker on our time, and at our event that we paid for, in a disrespectful manner.”
Shams accused the College Republicans of denying anyone with a “Muslim-sounding” name entrance to the event, but Ekman denied that claim. Many members of Students for Justice in Palestine are Muslim.
“We are not letting anybody in those [specific] groups in. It has nothing to do with racial profiling,” she said. “We spoke with Heather Larabee, [assistant dean of students and director of Campus Activities], and we told her exactly what we’re doing, so we’re in the clear.”
Larabee did not return calls asking for comment.
Ekman said the USC College Republicans are using Facebook to determine if students are associated with SJP or the Progressive Alliance and emailing these students to tell them they will not be allowed to attend the event.
“This is event is entirely privately funded, and thus USC College Republicans reserves the right to deny entrance to anyone for any reason,” the email reads. “The rhetoric utilized by students opposed to this event has given USC College Republicans extreme concern regarding the safety of our speaker and all those in attendance of the event. We have excluded your names from the RSVP list. Please do not attempt to attend our event, as you will be denied entrance.”
The College Republicans did not attempt to talk to members of SJP before the event in order to find a compromise between the two groups, because SJP and USC Progressive Alliance demonstrated they did not want to make amends with the College Republicans, Ekman said.
“[The USC Progressive Alliance made] fliers that pretend to be from our club and are inflammatory and derogatory and are types of slander,” she said. “By putting those words in our mouth, they have usurped their rights to have attendance to our event because they are not respectful at all.”
On his blog, Horowitz addressed the creation of the fliers, which were titled, “Hate Muslims? So Do We!!” and refuted the Progressive Alliance’s claims that he is a racist, saying they misquoted him.
Horowitz wrote that the Progressive Alliance flier attributed a quote to him which was “entirely invented” and “represent[s] nothing” that he has ever written.
Despite the controversy, Dan Schnur, the director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, said one of the benefits USC students receive is the opportunity to hear speakers of a wide range of ideas and opinions.
“Horowitz is certainly a very provocative speaker, but his is one voice of many in the debate over the future of the Middle East that has right to be heard,” he said.
How many times does it need to be pointed out:  Islam is NOT a “race”.  Islam is a religion.
Calling someone who calls Islam a supremacist religion does NOT make that person a “racist”.
Mohammed treated non-Muslims with contempt.  He forced them to convert to Islam, or forced them to pay a special tax that only non-Muslims had to pay, or if neither of these tactics worked he killed non-Muslims.
Mohammed waged many battles against non-Muslims.  This is easy to prove as stories of these battles and the sadistic actions Mohammed and his men participated in can be found in the Koran.  These stories are FROM the Koran.  David Horowitz did NOT make them up.
Mohammed taught his followers to force non-Muslims to convert, or to become second-class citizens, or to be killed if they did not convert or pay the special “non-Muslim” tax.  By the time of Mohammed’s death almost the entire Arabian Peninsula had been “cleansed” of all non-Muslims.  (Today this would be called “genocide.)
Islam is NOT a race.  It is a relibion.  It IS a supremacist religion which considers all others to be inferior.  This is what Horowitz said.
As a Mexican-American who identifies as a Republican, i find this kind of race based hate mongering as repulsive as it is unconstructive. This is exactly the kind of thing that is making the Republican Party less and less appealing to Americans, we need to return to the Repulblican Party of old, the party that protects civil liberties, that limits federal governmental powers while upholding states rights, that promotes the free market economy instead of making it an “old boys'” club. I hope the CR get their act together. : D
This is what a colleague of David Horowitz faced when speaking in London:
http://www.jihadwatch.org/2009/10/uk-muslim-protesters-threaten-geert-wilders-well-have-his-head.html
Is it any wonder the responisble college republicans are plocing who gains entry to Horowtiz’s lecture?
Sort of like the TSA looking out for the next Mohammed Atta.
If you want to talk about slander, how about the fact that the David Horowitz Freedom Center ran an ad in the UCSB campus paper claiming that the Muslim Student Association was a radical political group founded by the godfather of Al Qaeda and Hamas, what was this accusation based on, simply because they were muslim?
He started an organization called Discover the Networks that purports to keep tabs on leftist individuals and organizations because they may be in fact supporting Islamic terrorism.
So tell me how much of a benefit can students possibly derive from a speech from this guy? His parents were members of the communist party and ironcially if he were around back then he would most likely be part of the McCarthy mob that would have blacklisted them and even worse accused them of espionage and called for their deaths.
This is absurd. Not only because of the comments that Horowitz has made concerning other ethnic groups, but the fact that the GOP party can endorse this type of speaker/behavior. First Ann Coulter a few years back, and now this? The next thing I’ll read in the DT will be about Rush Limbaugh spreading his foolishness all over Bovard Auditorium. Ugh.
This is an outrage. If you want to associate/endorse this crap, then go off campus and don’t even think about using funds raised from USG towards paying your speaker/renting a venue to support this. I have been to several of the Unruh Institute’s events, and I really enjoyed them. Therefore, Mr. Schnur’s comment surprises me. No, he didn’t directly endorse it, and yes, we should be open to a variety of speakers at USC, but this is really just poor, poor taste. Surely there aren’t more conservative figures out there that are controversial for their concrete, well-reasoned points of view about the ME and not necessarily for the xenophobic comments they make?
To all of the sensible conservative Trojans out there, I know you’re there! Stand up and represent your party. Give Ms. Ekman a run for her money, and start your own Young Republicans club, as this is NOT how the face of the GOP should look at USC. The application of the label “conservative” should NOT be synonymous with racism and xenophobia, but inviting this speaker to campus convinces people otherwise.
…As for the right to peacefully protest: Why not?
I remember the controversy when Dr. Norman Finkelstein spoke on campus. He was also characterized as disseminating hate speech but was actually well-received by those in attendance. I saw Mr. Horowitz speak here at USC before on a panel with Yaron Brook discussiing the Mohammad cartoon controvery. He was often challenged on his assertions but was treated courteously throughout as I recall.
Maybe student groups could work together on events to pair some of the more provacative speakers so that a semblance of balance and the opportunity for rebuttal might diffuse some of the outrage that scheduling such individuals often engenders.
To reiterate one more time, the College Republicans only made the decision to limit who could attend based on past experiences Horowitz has faced when invited to and addressing college audiences.
Unfortunately Horowitz has often been met by Muslims and leftists who have shouted him off stage, and NOT given him the opportunity to freely speak.
Horowitz may not be right, or he may be perfectly right.  His words may be hateful, or they may be spot on.  In either case, he deserves the right and respect to share his words openly without being drowned out by a bunch of idiots who do NOT believe in an indiviual’s right to free speech.  This is all the College Republicans have decided to do because they knew to do otherwise would play into the hands of the real hate-mongers.
The ENTIRE LIST of SJP is restricted from the event. And only RSVP’d guests will be permitted inside. It is a privately funded event, and the CR’s are reserving their right to restrict entrance to potentially disruptive attendees who refuse to listen to what Horowitz has to say.
To say that CR’s hate Muslims or any race is a sweeping accusation prompted by ignorance and hate.
I pity those who look at this article and believe that the CR’s are inhibiting others right to free speech. In fact it is quite the opposite, and your comments that this should be shut down or the President of the club arrested is proof. They are not trying to stop protesting, they just do not want it to be done in a disruptive and disrespectful way to the speaker. And why would they let someone in to the event who they know is going to try to be disruptive?
Has anyone looked into what Horowitz actually talks about? Or are you all taking these out of context quotes at face value as fact. Anyone who does read what he has to say will know that he is not a racist, however, he is against fanatical hate speech, which I believe we have seen plenty of from the Progressive Alliance’s posters. Thank you all for proving his point.
unless the College Republicans are planning on paying USC for use of the space as well as electricity and other infrastructure costs, this event is far from “privately funded” thus, the CR claims about policing entry based on that fact are baseless.
CR has the right to refuse entry to whoever they please because they are not using USC funds for the event, they do not have the right to deny entry to USC students on the basis of race, ethnicity, or religion.  This is a violation of SCampus, and the onus to prove that they are not using racial, ethnic, and religious discrimination to deny access to the event to Arab and Muslim USC students needs to be proven by CR.
Students with Anglo names that are members of the SJP Facebook group were not denied RSVP status.  Muslim and Arab students that are not members of the SJP Facebook group were denied access.  So what CR is claiming is not ever remotely accurate.
College Republicans is claiming to be advocates of free speech for themselves while doing everything in their power to suppress the rights of free speech of others.  Also, College Republicans wants a one-sided event with no debate, disagreement, discussion, or constructive criticisms.
If College Republicans is confident in their position, they should not be afraid of people that disagree with them.
The Omar Barghouti event on Monday evening about Palestine and Israel included the Israel Studies Chair of UCLA as a respondent so that the event was not entirely one sided and there would be academic debate and disagreement.  I challenge College Republicans to try to match the same standard for themselves instead of being cowards who are too afraid to have their own viewpoints challenged publicly at their own event.
The banned groups do not believe in free speech.
Why should they be permitted to attend if their only intent is to suppress the free expression of ideas of the invited guest?  We have seen plenty of demonstrations of the type of behavior we could expect, at other campuses.
They are free to protest outside.
The USC College Republicans have chosen to keep certian specific students from entering the event on the grounds that those students have openly said their only intention is to disrupt the speaker. The USC CRs are protecting Horowitz’s  right to speak without disruption. Students who wish to protest may do so freely, outside of the event.
That the anti-Horowitz groups are claiming racial profiling is ridiculous and a slander against  the CRs.
If these groups support freedom of speech they should allow Horowitz to speak, and maybe even try to listen to what he has to say.

Jenny, call Horowitz’s dialogue what you want, but to me, any discourse that involves the demonization of a general sect of people is extremely dangerous, and I think it is negligible of a school with a large Muslim population to allow such dialogue in a campus venue. When speech endangers others, the issue of free speech becomes irrelevant. College Republicans have banned many on fear of David Horowitz’s safety, so why should Muslim students not have the right to register similar grievances regarding a man who comes to campus to stir up xenophobic sentiments? I hear what you’re saying, but I find your defense weak for ignoring these troubling sides of the issue.
Talk about cherry picking your Muslim history, Ali. Yes, all those things did happen, but you completely ignore the positive achievements of Muslims. I’m not going to bother going into similar atrocities from Christian and Jewish history, because it’s neither of us is going to sway the other.
College Republicans is conducting a private event. While it is being held on campus, it is perfectly legitimate for any group to enforce a guest list if their event is being privately funded as SJP could do if they so chose. Furthermore, Shams comments in the DT are slanderous becuase neither SJP nor Progressive Alliance has produced documented, specific evidence of Horowtiz being a racists. I assume that now we live in such an intolerant campus environment that anyone who is a Republican or Conservative and persumably disagress w/Obama, is a racist. Lincoln was a Republican. So was MLK. Learn the facts and history before you make unfounded and false statments that seek to infmlame the student body. Horowitz and his organziaiton, the Freedom Center, will likely take legal action against Shams, SJP, and Progressive Alliance. While there is a disguisting double standard on college campuses that makes it ok for other student organizations to slander College Republicans, the legal system is not plauged by a double standard. Those who actively spread false statments in writing and in publications are comitting the serious legal wrong of slander. And they can expect legal action to be taken against them. I encourage the student body to visit David Horowitz’s Freedom Center website (www.freedomcenter.org) to learn for themsevles what Horowitz and the Freedom Center stand for.
Steve,
I detect a fair bit of hate in your comment.
I do not mean to be glib, just real.  Your comment was what it was: opinionated and harshly judgemental.  Would you say the same thing about Jerimiah Wright?  Or is your knee-jerk opinion aimed soley at the right?
I do not agree with much of what Ann coulter has to say and find some of it offensive.  That said I do agree with some of what she has to say.  The key for me is to TRY to be open minded.  To “TRY” to be open minded is avery hard to do for al of us.  To condemn without thinking is what we’re fighting against, and I include the Republicans who are doing the right thing by bringing a fresh and very different voice to the college debate.  Bravo to them for doing so!  For the rest of us let’s listen and think before trying, judging and convicting.
@ Lindasy.. calm down, your ridiculous
@ “Ali”: There are almost 2 bn muslims and 14 million Jews, if you look at things in relative terms and not abolute terms, Jews have historically caused WAAY more bloodshed then Muslims. From the times of Jesus, to Palestine now. The first testament its self is full of violent claims. Jews believe it is their god given right to take the land of Palestine, and they are doing so by use of force. Jews and Muslims where living side by side peacefully prior to the Israeli Palestinian issue. Take your biased research somewhere else.
PS. I am NOT an anti-Semite, Jews have lost legitimacy in that claim, way too over used.
and do not attack Alex Shams, do not sue anyone. Be civil about this, find some legit claims to attack SJP on and do not coward out and call the big brother, fight this peaceful debate, don’t run away and attack the debater.
@Ali
I would tend to agree with Miles. 1000 years ago, Christians were waging religious wars against Muslims. 500 years ago Christians were waging religious wars against each other. Christians still target women, gay people and Jews. Now we are so fortunate in First World countries that Christian extremists are only bombing abortion clinics (to entirely disregard Third World Christianity).
Yet Republicans focus exclusively on human rights abuses by Muslims. Why? Republicans are Christians. Even the secular Ayn Rand folks rarely dare to confront Christianity simply because they couldn’t get away with it.
It is entirely hypocritical for Republicans to attack Islam over human rights—their anti-Islamic rhetoric is based instead on Christian norms. This is not to say we cannot criticize Islamic societies; it’s just disingenuous to describe their abuses as inherently Muslim.  
The Republicans young and old are just hate mongers no matter what side of the ledger. They had Ann Coulter last year who is hateful of the Jews so they play no favorites only bringing the worst of the worst to the campus of USC. Their idea of “Fight On” goes the furthest away from the sports area.
Free speech remains a precious, and easily lost, right. USC should be proud that it can host such a wide variety of speakers from around the world in a civilzed, tolerant atmosphere.
As the legendary journalist I.F. Stone noted, “even under the worst dictator, it is not forbidden to agree with him. It is the freedom to disagree that is freedom of speech.”
agreed.
As an alumnus and donor I’ve just made President Sample’s office aware that the use of U.S.C. facilities in a way that prohibits free discussion and speech, as a form of preemptive censorship, not only offends me but will cause me to take my donations to my postgraduate institution.
This issue is not Jew vs. Muslim. I’m neither and frankly think the world would be better off is both groups would peacefully exist. However to ban individuals from a speech on a university campus because they theoretically may be disruptive is not something a high quality institution should allow. If College REpublicans wish to discriminate in this way they need to take their event off campus.
Thank you for making the relevant point. We can bicker all day about Horowitz, the point is, they’re letting him speak on the basis of “free speech” and then preventing those who disagree to attend. I understand they CAN do it because it’s a private event, but it’s just wrong and hypocritical.
To All
From what I have read, there has been a clear intent to disrupt this event. Lets not look beyond what it is, another group trying to disrupt anothers private event. This man clearly costs a lot to get here thus I understand Ekman’s decision to not allow those affiliated with the other group. That makes perfect sense especially after the slander that they sent out which i saw at VKC.
Fight On!!
Miles,
Mohammed was a warrior.  He preached the spread of Islam by whatever means necessary.  Are you caliming this is not true?
Then how do you explain the following?  Are these all examples of a “small, minority sect” as you claim?
Sudan:  Muslims have killed 400,000 and created 2.5 million refugees.
Somalia:  Total anarchy thanks to Muslims.
Thailand:  Over 4,000 Buddhists killed in last four years by Muslims.
India:  Under constant threat from Muslims…Mumbai massacres targeted non-Muslims.
Kashmir:  A hot-zone between Pakistan and India.  Muslims claim Kashmir belings to them despite Hindus presence there fro thousands of years.
Pakistan:  Thousands killed (sunnis by Shia and Shia by Sunnis).
Afghanistan:  Taliban have murdered tens of thousands with the emphasis on helpless women.
Iraq/Iran War:  One million Muslims killed by fellow Muslims, Shia v Sunni and vice-a-versa.
Saudi Arabia:  Shia are second class citizens.  There is not one, single non-Muslim citizen of this country.  Not one.
Yemen:  Several hundred Shias have been killed in the past year by Sunni.
Englan:  several hundred commuters were killed by Muslims.
Spain:  Several hundred commuters were killed by Muslims.
New York City:  Several thousand civilians killed by Muslims.
Beslan Grammar School/Russia:  Over one hundred school children killed by Muslims.
Western China:  Dozens killed by Muslims.
Some of the most ancient Christian communities are under attack…
Egypt:  The ancient Coptic Christian communities are under siege
Iraq:  The anciet Chaldean Christian community is under siege
Nigeria:  Christians in the south are being killed by Muslims.
Malaysi and Indonesia impose limits on Christian’s freedoms.
Bali:  Hundred killed by Muslims at a disco.
Turket:  Today Turkey is 99% Muslim, 1% other religions.  90 Years ago Muslims killed 1.5 million Armenian Christians in the “Armenian Genocide”.
Tell me again how kind and tolerant Muslims are.
Don’t get me wrong.  I’m sure your friends are wonderful.  But the facts ennumerated above are sticky facts, not some fantasy created in a right-winger’s mind.  The Bali disco was bombed.  One million Muslims were killed in the Iraq/Iran War.  Sudan has become a killing field thanks to Islam.  Are you denying these facts?  Why is this so widespread if Islam is a tolerant, peaceful religion?
And Chris & Ali, how can both of you make such sweeping generalizations of predominantly Muslim countries? Similarly, you make a romanticized generalization of Israel, completely ignoring its strong record of war crimes against civilians in recent years.
The issue is not as black and white as you make it out to be. There are dangerous sects of Islam, just as there are dangerous sects of Judaism and virtually all other religions. 9/11 brought us close to one such sect, but in spite of the horrible things that happened on that day, there is no basis to vilify the inhabitants of Muslim nations, the majority of whom are opposed to violence and fundamentalist fascism. Did you miss the protests in Iran?
I have several Muslim friends and they are among the kindest, most diplomatic and peace loving people I know. How dare you write off an entire ethnic population as adherent to religious barbarism.
Yes, I understand that the event is private. The CR can enforce whatever they want, as much as we may disagree with it.
The problem is that USC is allowing CR to use a campus venue when the enforced policy directly contradicts USC’s own written values regarding racial discrimination and tolerance. It’s a moral violation.
You want hatred?  You want freedom of speech?  You want freedom of education?  You want woman’s rights?  Or, do you want a hate-filled supremacist religion instead?
One of Islam’s core tenants is “us versus them”.  Muslims ARE superior.  Non-Muslims are Kafirs, inferior.  Find me one Muslim dominated country where this is NOT so.
Meanwhile, as Islam tightens its grip we get more and more of the following:
Pakistan: Jihadists blow up high school for girls
It is fairly common to see the tribal regions of Pakistan described as “lawless,” as this story does. But while the central government may not have meaningful authority in the area, it is not lawlessness, per se, that is the issue. Instead, it is the imposition by force of Sharia law.
“Militants blow up Pakistan girls school: officials,” from Agence France-Presse, November 1:
PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Islamist militants blew up a girls school in Pakistan’s lawless Khyber tribal district Sunday, destroying the building and wounding four people in neighbouring homes, officials said.
Two explosions ripped through the 18-room government high school for girls at Kari Gar village and a boy who watched the premises is missing, possibly kidnapped by the militants, local administration officials said.
“The militants have blown up the school with two blasts and all rooms were demolished,” said administration official Shafeer Ullah.
“Four people in neighbouring houses were also wounded and their homes slightly damaged. We’re still trying to find out what happened to the office boy,” Ullah told AFP.
Another of Khyber’s administrators, Farooq Khan, confirmed the incident.
Islamist militants, who have carved out a strong presence in Pakistan’s semi-autonomous tribal belt on the Afghan border, have destroyed hundreds of schools, mostly for girls, in the northwest of the country in recent years.
Nearly 200 schools were destroyed in the Swat valley alone during a two-year Taliban uprising to enforce sharia law in a district once favoured by Western tourists for its ski slopes and bracing mountain air….
Lindsay is absolutely correct. Alex Shams, you cannot slander another individual is a student newspaper. There are legal consequences to your quote in DT and the flyers you have been distributing. Instead of attacking Horowitz, why don’t you go work for “justice in Palestine?” You won’t becuase your organization is not at it’s core pro-palestinian, it is at it’s core a virulent anti-Israel group which often employs anti-semitic methods. Why don’t we raise the issue of the speaker you brought? Omar Barghouti? He callied for the annihilation of Israel, which is the equivalent of the annihilaition of 6 million jews. Does that number sound familiar? Wake up USC community. Israel stands for peace, and human rights in the Middle East. I dare say if Shams visited Israel he would enjoy far more rights in Israel than in any other country in the Middle East. In all countires besides Israels, non-muslims, women, and homosexuals are denied many rights they enjoy Israel. In some countires, homosexuals are stoned to death for their sexual orientation as are women who to disobey the males in their families. Shams should take a trip to all the countries in the Mid East before he wastes his time calling a pro-Israel speaker a racist.
The is a private events. As such CRs can chose to enforce their guest list any way they choose. They are not receiving one penny from the Univeristy. Furthermore, Horowitz IS NOT  a racist or any other slanderous term these far left groups are calling. It’s interesting how they just say, Horowitz said blah blah but produce no documented quotes. These groups are setting themsevles up for a big, fat slander lawsuit. There are consequences to slandering other individuals. And College Republicans refuses to stand idly by while they are so disguistingly attacked as is their speaker. Before you make infmalatory and untruthful statements in a college newspaper, verify that what you are saying is 100% factual. Otherwise you set youself up for a big fat slander lawsuit. Sure, you think, “I am a student. I don’t have any money to pay?”. Well once you do start working, the court will garnish your wages for years. And that way you will be paying for years, for slandering a speaker and a student organization just becuase you disagree with their political views.
Wow.
Seriously, you fear for the safety of the audience and the speaker? I mean, I totally get the “not wanting disruptions on the speaker’s time,” since you paid for him and all, but don’t get melodramatic. No one is assassinating Horowitz, I would like to believe.
I’m not familiar with the background of this, but I think the College Republicans have entirely overstepped here.  Have a little faith in your fellow students to not assault a visiting speaker.
Weenies.
This is absolutely ABSURD! How can USC permit this kind of racial discrimination on campus?! This has to be reported to the administration by as many people as possible. The USC College Republicans have gone too far with racial profiling this time, and it is irresponsible and shameful of the USC administration to allow them a venue for such segregated events on our campus.
This man needs to be arrested tomorrow, along with this Ekman girl or whatever. These people are dangerous to society. They incite violence and racism.
I am one of a number of Muslim students who is NOT in SJP or any of the above mentioned groups and has been denied to the event out of the concerns of a security threat.
Eckman is lying through her teeth in this article, and I am proof of this.
USC GOP is denying students like me with Muslim-sounding names entry, which is illegal under USC rules.

Paul Rockower walks the USC campus decked out in bling from around the world.
“This is from Tibet,” Rockower said, fiddling with a metal bracelet that looks like it was formerly a decorative silverware handle. “I traded a Chicago Cubs T-shirt for it in Shigatse.”
Common bonds · Displaying now through May 2010, Paul Rockower’s exhibit, 21st Century Family of Man, represents the masters of public diplomacy major’s last 11 years of traveling the world as a student, journalist and explorer. India, Israel and China are among the countries he has visited. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The USC master of public diplomacy student also sports an array of necklaces — a charm from a shrine in Pakistan, another from a sheik temple, Brazilian nuts dangling from knotted twine, a simple silver Star of David — collected during the past 11 years of exploring the world as a student, journalist and explorer.
In the second-floor Annenberg Gallery, Rockower’s travels are documented in a more accessible form. Selected from thousands of images taken during his adventures around the globe, 21st Century Family of Man exhibit features a lobby and conference room’s worth of professional-grade photos documenting the commonality among the people and places Rockower has encountered.
“The overall connection is that family is family wherever you go,” Rockower said. “You can be anywhere in the world and find similarities.”
As the first student to utilize the space, Rockower also hopes that 21st Century Family of Man will turn the Annenberg Gallery — primarily an outlet for working artists — into a student arena. Previous exhibits have showcased Pulitzer Prize-winning photo essays, editorial cartoons and 1960s political posters, but never student works.
“You make your opportunities by asking for it and hopefully more students will see it and take advantage,” Rockower said.
Both the exhibition’s title and subject matter are throwbacks to the groundbreaking 1955 New York Museum of Modern Art show titled The Family of Man. The original Family of Man featured 503 black-and-white photographs taken by 273 amateur and professional photographers from around the world.
Like a mirror reflecting images of the world back onto itself, the exhibition brought striking photos of the human existence to viewers living in a tumultuous post-war era. The message of basic cultural similarities was so strong that The Family of Man spent the next eight years touring the world, eventually showing in 37 countries on six continents.
But a lot has changed since 1955.
“The original Family of Man was very much an element of the generation it came from. At the time, the pictures were universal, but now, they look dated,” Rockower said.
Advancements in commercial travel and information technology have created a post-postmodern world smaller than the one captured in the original MOMA exhibit, and though human commonality is still a reality, it was in desperate need of a visual update.
Through both 35mm film and digital photography, Rockower’s 21st century revamp captures the essence of our new common bonds if not through lush, color images of Nigerian children wearing Britney Spears shirts, then by virtue of the exhibit’s creation.
“Fifty years ago, you needed [about] 300 photographers to capture the world,” Rockower said. “Now, because of changes in communication and travel, I can do what it took [about] 300 photographers to do.”
Although the diverse display of cultures is Rockower’s first major exhibition, the self-taught photographer’s goals for sharing his Picasa Web Album are loftier than simple bragging rights. As a student in the country’s first and only public diplomacy program, Rockower hopes that by bringing the images of the world to USC, he can create a two-way dialogue that will inspire students to travel and see for themselves how alike humanity can be.
“Traveling is an investment in yourself,” Rockower said. “It’s so easy, it’s so much fun and it’s so beneficial.”
The self-proclaimed “bohemian, Orientalist Zionist” grew up on the East Coast, but found a rush in traveling at a young age. During high school, his involvement with the Young Judea group took him on a summer trip to Israel. Wanting to learn more about the country, he spent a year studying in Jerusalem and then backpacked around Europe for six weeks.
“It was such a mind-blowing experience because I was 19 and here I am wandering around Prague,” Rockower said.
After graduating from Brandeis University in Massachusetts with a bachelor’s degree in Islamic and Middle Eastern studies, Rockower nabbed a job at the Israeli Foreign Ministry in Houston and spent time exploring the diversity in his own backyard.
“I treated Texas as a study abroad experience. It’s got such a different culture and I could appreciate it as something different,” Rockower said. “I could call myself the Israeli Ambassador to the Republic of Texas.”
Through a rotary fellowship, Rockower ended up in South Africa, reporting on Jewish communities in remote villages for the Jerusalem Post and continued to alternate between traveling and working until finally deciding to relocate to Los Angeles to attend USC. As of this past summer’s trip to Japan, he has been to 45 countries.
The 21st Century Family of Man showcases 70 photos of somber adults, happy children, obscure cities and recognizable monuments, documenting a period of Rockower’s life that has made him who he is today.
“I want people to see the world and realize how similar we are and how rewarding it is to take those steps,” Rockower said. “It’s a matter of trying to understand the way the world is, but you can’t understand it if you don’t see it, taste it or hear the music.”

USC frequently touts the fact that it enrolls the most international students out of any other American institution.
And for the eighth year, the university has done it again.
According to the annual Open Doors report released today by the Institute of International Education, 7,482 international students attended the university in the 2008-2009 academic year.
New York University came in second place, with 6,761 students, and Columbia University in third, with 6,685 students.
The next California school on the list was UCLA, which came in eighth place with 5,590 international students.
USC also set two records in terms of enrollments by country. There are 1,623 Indian students at USC — the largest segment of the university’s international population. Students from China make up the second-largest group of international students at USC, at 1,428.
According to an article posted on USC’s website, officials said the university’s reputation on the Pacific Rim and an expanding alumni base in China and Indian that increases recruiting efforts helps USC attract high levels of students from these two countries.
“USC has long been a leader in attracting international students from all corners of the globe,” said C. L. Max Nikias, executive vice president and provost, in the article. “These students bring a wide range of ideas and beliefs to our campuses, as well as an abundance of intelligence and creativity. Not only do they benefit from their experience at USC, but they offer our domestic students a rich resource for teaching and learning.”
The survey also showed that the number of international students at about 3,000 institutions in the United States rose 8 percent from last year, setting a new record of 671,616 students.

When word got out that John Woo was making a historical war film, few knew what to expect. An army of white doves? Close-quarter crossbow shootouts?
Instead, the director of Hong Kong gangster classics such as Hard Boiled delivers an intense retelling of The Battle of Red Cliffs in ancient China. Though not a perfect war film, Red Cliff has enough flair and ambition to let us all know that crossbows are just as cool as submachine guns.
Battle cry · John Woo’s Red Cliff, which is set in 208 CE, has become the highest grossing film in mainland China since it opened in 2008. - Photo courtesy of Magnolia Pictures
It’s the year 208 CE, and Prime Minister Cao Cao of the Han Dynasty has no problems bossing his young emperor around. When his hunt for rebels ends in the slaughter of innocent villagers, some nobles such as Lui Bei decide enough is enough. With the help of his wise adviser, Zhuge Liang, Liu Bei allies with Viceroy Zhou Yu, another southern noble, and together they face off against Cao Cao’s 800,000-man army.
As a veteran of modern action flicks, Woo has his own ideas about Chinese third-century warfare. On a large scale, the massive battles are historical, with chessboard tactics and epic charges.
Up close, however, the action becomes more stylized, with some fighters body-slamming horses and impaling four people with a single spear thrust. These up close moments give the film a definite flair and original feel that manages to sidestep the risk of feeling hokey.
Woo does not create the kabuki-esque fights seen in Hero, and has no qualms dishing out the blood and gore, but the larger than life parts of the film make it feel less like a historical film and more like a war song in the vein of Herodotus’ Histories compared to Frank Miller’s 300. Or for Chinese history fans, more like Romance of the Three Kingdoms than Records of the Three Kingdoms.
This characteristic leads Red Cliff into its chief problem. Epics are great, but they cannot be half-done. Red Cliff still clings to the desire to be a historical film. The switches from realistic to grandiosity are jarring. Ultimately, they make it difficult for the audience to connect with the film.
This connection is what separates Gladiator from Gods and Generals. Without it, the film is left hanging on a museum wall instead of jumping off the screen and dragging you in.
Red Cliff may feel stage-y, but its cast does not. Tony Leung Chiu Wai, who had such a burning intensity in Lust, Caution, is completely believable as the warrior-poet Zhou Yu. He does not need to have his whole family slaughtered to show us war is painful — it’s all there in glances and murmurs.
Zhang Fengyi, who plays Cao Cao, gives an ambitious humanity to what could easily be a one-dimensional villain.
Bringing up the girl’s team is Wei Zhou as Zhou Yu’s sister, Sun Shangxiang, who is fierce without blatant “girl power” rah-rahs. Less interesting is Chiling Lin as Zhou Yu’s swan-necked wife, Xiao Qaoi, whose plot arc seems just a little too maudlin and convenient.
The best performance belongs to Takeshi Kaneshiro as Zhuge Liang. Behind his every smile, you have no idea if he’s planning a bloody ambush or just enjoying the music. If Woo ever delves more into the Three Kingdoms period, Kaneshiro would be fantastic reprising his role and taking the reins as one of the period’s greatest thinkers.
Through no fault of the cast, Red Cliff can be hard to follow, especially for those unfamiliar with Chinese history. Trying to keep track of who’s fighting also distracts from the clanging swords and flying heads. Most characters are introduced through dialogue, but the audience has no time to make sense of the information overload. These exposition bombs come from the cuts made for the American release — the original Chinese cut is almost five hours, and was released as a two-part saga.
Despite its flaws, Red Cliff is still a very entertaining film. It is simply impossible to ignore its ambitious style and Woo has definitely begun to absolve himself of his sins in Paycheck.
It is always interesting to see the results of a talented director branching out into new genres. Woo proves he is just as capable of staging fights on the battlefield as he is in teahouses. Red Cliff may not cement itself as the definitive Three Kingdoms film, but it’s worth its weight in popcorn.
I liked Woo’s other flicks, maybe too violent for American tastes, like “The Killer, A Better Tomorrow, Hard Boiled…”
Those defined the “Hong Kong” shooters.

Los Angeles is the future. Or, that’s what it used to be. Though the city is still part of the American myth of manifest destiny and upward mobility, Los Angeles is also part of a state that seems to be in a constant state of both disarray and innovation. Even the first introduction to the city  seems at once progressive and backward physically, culturally and spiritually.
Flying into Los Angeles International Airport is a strange, holy experience. The first glimmer of native architecture is the motif of powder-blue swimming pools and, once the jet has landed, the futuristic, alien-like structure of Encounter Bar & Restaurant, a Jetsons-like, geometric building that predicted that by the end of the 20th century we would be eating TV dinners on the moon.
The whole complex is a sad first greeting to a downtrodden population that wheels its luggage through the LAX terminals.
Even as visitors-cum-residents leave the airport, that same unsure progress-turned-digression unfolds. The traffic crawling on old roads debilitates a population that has depended on the fantasy of spontaneous, immediate movement as its very identity. An aging strip club sits next to a stainless steel Carl’s Jr.; modern, sleek hotels rest across from theme restaurants celebrating the golden age of flight.
Los Angeles constantly changes; it has been a wasteland of crime, a fantasy factory, technology hub and a cultural mosaic. But the city needs to realize that as the cultural and economical focus shift toward places like Downtown and the neighborhoods along the new Eastside Metro extension like Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles, the city needs to reckon with an identity forever in limbo. Despite the expanding public transportation and the effort to create a Downtown heart, we will never be the metropolis we have created in countless movies.
We feed into it wholeheartedly; the movie industry, which overwhelmingly fuels the area’s minds and wallets, has destroyed Los Angeles so many times at the contentment of outsiders everywhere: Volcano, Escape from LA and Independence Day punish Angelenos with natural and alien disasters. And Kurt Russell’s eye-patch.
Despite the ominous feelings of doom, Angelenos still seek an entirely old-fashioned way of predicting what is to come: fortune-telling, which, if any observant Angeleno knows, seems to have prime real estate throughout the area. As outdated as fortune-telling may seem, the residents and tourists alike still seek their local oracles for guidance.
One such business is hidden in the Old Chinatown Plaza, a neon outdoor plaza bustling with tourists, families and couples with matching nose piercings on a freakishly hot November Sunday afternoon.
The psychic at It Pun Fortune Readings sits in front of a small storefront chewing a piece of fluffy, white bread. He is the one clairvoyant, after speaking to one on Hill Street and another in the courtyard, that will allow me to pay a fee, listen to my future and let me take vigorous notes upon the subject for a story.
In a black suit and a camouflage army hat, he squints at me with his dark, old eyes and the wrinkles deepen on his face as he looks at my hands through a magnifying glass with a lens the size of an expensive steak and a handle with enough sterling silver to make a hefty sword.
For $10, he told me the following after I asked him what was in store for me as well as the city in which he has told fortunes for 19 years: I will have three children and I will marry my third boyfriend. I will live to see 103, thanks to a very long line down the outside edge of my hand. My best luck comes in the summertime, and my honesty is my truest asset. This was all recorded with his red Xs and Os on a set photocopied template: my future in shorthand.
Recording his prediction would change my destiny, according the first psychic I tried speaking to. By putting such supernatural talents on paper, I have the power to alter the universe’s energy against me, putting myself in a precarious position, ripe for a good heaping portion of bad luck.
My Sunday oracle was the representation of a Los Angeles caught between opposites; a city showing its age and steeped in uncertain tradition, but methodically looking toward a limitless future. He was an LA transplant who found wealth through reinvention through storytelling and gumption, practicing an art of the past by seeing what is to come.
He still didn’t tell me what fate has in store for the city he lives and works in, but rather nodded, smiled and handed me my photocopy as he returned to his roll.
In a city where luck and hard work lives next to the commercial yet creative, and the archaic but contemporary combine, you never know what to expect next.

On Tuesday, President Barack Obama addressed the nation from US Military Academy at West Point regarding his plan to end the war in Afghanistan.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
In the midst of rising unemployment, historic deficits and a new health care system, Americans listened attentively to the president’s words in search of an answer for why they should still be focused on a war that has lasted eight years.
The commander in chief tried to convince Americans to hold on, but his speech left many questions unanswered.
Al-Qaida still poses  a real threat, though the Washington Post reported recently that there are only an estimated 100 members left in Afghanistan. Obama didn’t try to belie the gravity of the situation.
But with so much speculation about the next step, the president still hasn’t convinced the public that the end justifies the means.
Asking for $30 billion more per year to fund a war that’s already cost $172 billion as of April is a tall order and  leaves the nation wondering: With all our overwhelming domestic problems, at what point do we cut our losses?
Health care reform, expected to be approved in the coming month, will run the nation $850 billion over 10 years, a staggering number considering the nation’s $1.4-trillion deficit. Compound that with multibillion-dollar bailouts for the Bank of Americas, GMs and Freddie Macs of the world, and the public has reason to be wary of the expenses.
But the truth is, despite the staggering prices of bailouts and reforms, the spending is necessary to sustain and change the American infrastructure.
The same can’t be said for expenses in Afghanistan. At some point, enough is enough.
Obama undoubtedly understands the implications of an escalated front. He wisely chose an audience full of the men and women whom he is asking to fight overseas. But the public must have full confidence in Obama if the war is to move forward — support he didn’t garner with his speech Tuesday evening.
First of all, where do we get the money? Do we fund the war with a progressive tax, or do we freeze other spending and allocate funds away from projects such as the $787 billion stimulus package passed in February? Financing, though, isn’t the only question. His plan still has many holes.
For example, why does the commander in chief plan on deploying only 30,000 more troops, when Gen. Stanley McChrystal said that a minimum of 40,000 troops were needed to succeed in Afghanistan.
It makes even less sense that Obama would set a deadline to withdraw troops by July 2011. If success in Afghanistan is that critical, why force our way out if we fail? The Afghanistan government is not yet fully stable after eight long years. How is it going to improve so dramatically in just two?
Although a final date helps citizens keep the end in sight and reminds Afghan President Hamid Karzai that America will only be around for so long, there is a real possibility that two years won’t be long enough.
Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) remark that, “The way that you win wars is you break the enemy’s will, not announce when you are leaving,” is more rational. Sure enough, Obama is losing support from anti-war Democrats convinced that he’s digging himself deeper into a hole and still pretending China is on the other side.
Whether or not the allocations of troops will ultimately prove to be the correct choice, Obama left many questions unanswered by the time he stepped away from the podium.
Robert Fragoza is a junior majoring in chemical engineering. His column, “Reality Check,” ran Fridays.
It is time to pull out of Afghanistan and Iraq!  Bring our boys home and give us all the health care we deserve now!  The money wasted by our goverment trying to kill innocent people will pay for quailty health care for all of us.  We all voted for Obama to get us out of these Hell Holes!  Obama, please stick to your campaign promises and dismantel the BCS system now!  There has to be a better system that doesn’t favor the SEC.
Fragoza, you’re right on the money with most of this article. Obama is clearly faking it here, with his speech full of contradictions. Victory is absolutely critical, but we’re going to quit in two years whether we win or lose. This is a war of necessity, but we aren’t sure if the cost is justified. Karzai is hopelessly corrupt, and he is just the right man for this alliance. We’re sending 30,000 troops and building a counterinsurgency strategy based on making the people know they can trust us… but we’re also telling the Taliban exactly when they can begin moving back into power.
You blew it by interjecting a lunatic opinion without any sort of evidene to back it up: “But the truth is, despite the staggering prices of bailouts and reforms, the spending is necessary to sustain and change the American infrastructure. The same can’t be said for expenses in Afghanistan.” The article would have been better if you’d just left it out. Or you could do what the professionals at the big liberal rags do: find somebody other than yourself to make that statement, and then quote them.
I must say I was insulted by the President’s speech.
The issue is not a bunch of people running around some hills in the middle of Asia.
The issue is the people that read the Wall Street Journal, NY Times, and others whio want to do this nation ill.
It is the money people who pay the bills of others that are the real ememies.
I would hope the President gets real on this issue.  As I see it the president is playing “Lets you and him fight”.

Swine flu. Sinking economy. Struggling wars overseas. These are just a few of the blights we endured in 2009. Not to mention the fact that we suffered Sarah Palin while she was “going rogue.”
It is easy to recall 2009 and shake our heads in disbelief, to hope that we were sleeping and the past 12 months were merely a prolonged nightmare. But it is important to remember that the whole value of 2009 is greater than the sum of its often-troubling parts.
Aaron Rovner | Daily Trojan
Though 2009 was not a year of obvious triumphs, it hosted a series of crucial social steps and positive political decisions that will ensure progress for the future, spurring a massive overhaul in our nation’s culture.
We should look at 2009 as a reason to be hopeful because this year was a turning point. Americans used this past year to boldly declare that we will no longer tolerate a lack of transparency in our government and that we demand to see proactive steps that will create positive change.
And proactive steps were exactly what we took. The country exhaled a collective sigh of relief when President Barack Obama was inaugurated on Jan. 20, ushering in an era of new leadership for our floundering nation.
His inauguration was also a significant display of social progress, as Obama became the first black president, an accomplishment that seemed impossible as little as 65 years ago with the segregation of troops during World War II, or even as little as 18 years ago when the Watts riots erupted in Los Angeles. Obama’s feat was made even more momentous as he was inaugurated the day after 2009’s celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
Another proactive step that made 2009 a good year was the beginnings of an international agreement to control greenhouse gas emissions that took place during December’s climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark. Even Chinese officials agreed to attend the conference, despite having been key adversaries of the United States in regards to the issue of monitoring toxic emissions. Securing China’s presence and openness to some form of a climate agreement during 2009 has blazed a trail for our leaders to create politically binding agreements to help preserve our planet’s resources.
Just as Obama’s inauguration served as a catalyst for social change and the climate summit created the framework for future emissions commitments, the recent decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan for a limited duration with an emphasis on training local forces puts an end in sight for a war that has gone on too long.
This year also brought good news when activists proved that the job of building a stronger future is not solely in the hands of politicians, as communities including students and families rallied behind important issues.
Many who were disappointed by the outcome of California’s November 2008 vote to ban gay marriages used 2009 to actively support same-sex couples who wished to wed. Those against Proposition 8 were tireless in their efforts during the past year that a federal trial began Monday to determine the constitutionality of the measure that bans same-sex marriage.
Other issues affected our student community on a local level in 2009, such as President Steven B. Sample’s decision to retire. The news initially disappointed our community, but if we look beyond the surface we can see that the change in leadership provides an opportunity to positively impact students’ lives at USC in 2010.
Though his presence will be missed, President Sample’s retirement presents a healthy challenge for the current generation of USC students and faculty to uphold his legacy of academic excellence and innovation, and hopefully encourage the Trojan Family to rise to the occasion.
Of course, it is impossible to refer back to 2009 as a good year without honoring Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, the U.S. Airways pilot who miraculously landed an Airbus A320 in the Hudson River after its engines were disabled when it hit a flock of birds during takeoff, saving the lives of all 155 people on board. His heroic act reminds us that, although there is much work to be done in crafting a better future, 2009 still gave us many tangible reasons to celebrate.
The relentless efforts made during 2009 didn’t satisfy the desire for instant gratification that our society usually enjoys via fast-food restaurants and online shopping, but these innovative strides have created an end in sight for many of the problems that previously made our futures look so bleak.
We must have patience while the steps taken in 2009 work slowly to improve the economy, end our involvement in war, heal our environment and increase peaceful international communication. Additionally, it is our responsibility to build upward from the groundwork that was laid last year.
We have so many resources at our fingertips, especially technological tools that can facilitate international communication as we make changes during 2010 — even President Obama already uses YouTube to make weekly addresses. If we continue this trend of using technology to extend our reach in creating a unified community, 2010 can set the stage for exciting large-scale change.
Because of the impact that this year’s choices will have on revitalizing our quality of life for the future, 2009 was definitely a good year.

Junior running back Joe McKnight came under fire over the winter break, as accusations of an illegal gift from a businessman, which would be an NCAA violation, became wide-spread.
Escaping pressure · While NCAA allegations swirled during winter recess, McKnight took the opportunity to declare his intent to enter the 2010 NFL Draft, forgoing his senior year of eligibility. - Daily Trojan | Brandon Hui
The Los Angeles Times ran an article just before Christmas that looked at McKnight’s use of a 2006 Land Rover that he had been seen driving. The vehicle allegedly belongs to a Santa Monica businessman, Scott Schenter, who works for the County Assessor’s office. Schenter also founded a company called USC Marketing in 2008, which he says stands for United States China Marketing and is not connected to the university.
Any use of this vehicle by McKnight as a benefit from a marketing representative, agents or anyone of that nature would be a violation of NCAA rules. Accordingly, the NCAA responded to the accusations by investigating the situation.
McKnight was even forced to sit out of the Trojan’s San Francisco Emerald Bowl game after he was deemed unable to play by USC’s compliance department.
Schenter has reached out to the media in defense of McKnight, saying he has “nothing to do with agents, marketing players or representing athletes,” and that he has no ties to USC, as he is a University of Washington fan.
Schenter continued to explain that the vehicle belongs to a young woman named Johana Michelle Beltran, McKnight’s girlfriend, and that he helped her purchase the vehicle because the Beltran family was having trouble getting qualified for a loan.
McKnight has denied driving the car, though a Times reporter has claimed to see him driving it more than one time.
While everyone’s focus has shifted from McKnight to the NCAA basketball sanctions and Pete Carroll’s decision to become the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks, McKnight announced his decision to enter the NFL draft and leave USC a year early.
“The time is right,” McKnight told ESPN. “This was my first healthy season and I really don’t want to come back and risk injury.”
The time may be right in terms of injury, but his decision also comes at a time where intense speculation follows him all over the USC campus. McKnight, however, explained that these ongoing investigations and allegations do not have an impact on the decision he has made, but that other factors, like the comparison to former Trojan Reggie Bush, have solidified his NFL verdict.
“If I would have come back it would have been to pursue the Heisman,” he said. “My career was OK. It was good, but not like Reggie. There was a constant pressure to be like Reggie.”
McKnight has more in common with Bush than he might have wanted after the allegations made by the Times last month. USC is already under investigation by the NCAA along with the Pac-10 about the accusations that Bush (and basketball star O.J. Mayo, as well) received improper benefits during their time at school.
McKnight’s decision to turn pro during this time in USC sports may be fortuitous, since, after Carroll’s resignation settled, the focus would have shifted back to McKnight.
[…] RB Joe McKnight made the decision to leave USC early, but he is still under intense fire for allegation of illegal gifts.  Hey, it’s USC, isn’t that the nature of the program? (Daily […]

Last week, Haiti experienced a 7.0 magnitude earthquake in the capital city of Port-au-Prince, followed by incessantly large aftershocks. The prime minister of Haiti says more than 70,000 deaths have been recorded, with early estimates placing the death toll above 200,000 people.
To put that into perspective, the death toll from Hurricane Katrina was 1,836. 
In 2008, China’s Sichuan earthquake, which nearly leveled an entire province, killed about 70,000 people with more than 18,000 missing.
The Nargis Cyclone that destroyed much of Burma in 2008 wrought up to 138,000 deaths.
In each of these disasters, governments of the nations involved aided the areas, and governments from around the world offered relief money. With the earthquake in Haiti, the United States has pledged $100 million in aid along with 10,000 troops for a year. China and Europe have acted in a similar though more modest manner.
This government aid and emergency relief is necessary immediately following such a tragedy in order to be effective: The military brings organizational help for the distribution of food and water to those displaced by natural disaster and soldiers help bring order to the chaos and looting on the streets while emergency workers search for missing people. We often forget, however, about the other crucial and effective source of redevelopment — non-governmental organizations and faith-based organizations.
In addition to government aid, President Barack Obama commissioned former presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton to raise money for effective and appropriate aid to Haiti. Yet, in an interview on Fox News, both Bush and Clinton encouraged faith-based groups as “a very important part of not only this emergency but the long-term reconstruction of Haiti.”
In summer of 2008, just after China’s earthquake, I had the opportunity to spend almost two weeks aiding the recovery effort in Sichuan’s disaster zone. Every night, I watched the same clips of the Chinese government helping the destroyed areas, but I was most impressed by the substantial number of people that cared, especially the massive volunteer movement of Chinese students and underground Christian churches. These groups greatly impacted relief efforts by raising spirits and reaching reaching out to remote villages.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
One 2008 USC alumni, who has chosen to remain anonymous because of the sensitive nature of his involvement, spent many months directing relief efforts in Burma with a Christian organization. The group entered the country providing humanitarian aid prior to Cyclone Nargis.
Although Burma resisted all international aid and is infamous for its list of egregious human rights violations, the Burmese government gave complete freedom to the NGO and even provided financial resources since the group was so effective.
When it comes to natural disasters and catastrophes, governments are great at providing immediate relief, search and rescue and rebuilding infrastructure — all necessary aspects of recovery and moving forward. Groups are best, however, at helping others because of relational capacity and compassion.
In devastated areas like Haiti, we humans rise up compassionately to meet the challenge. Currently, money is flooding into relief organizations, and volunteer lists to travel there are filled with people who are eager to go to Haiti to help.
Even here at USC, the Keck School of Medicine sent a team of doctors to treat victims. Also, CrisisCamp, a student group on campus, is providing data, information, maps and technical assistance to NGOs to assist Haiti.
“People were fighting to survive before the earthquake struck. I can’t even imagine how desperate the situation is now,” said Jon Porter, a junior majoring in business administration, who worked in Haiti caring for local orphans during spring break last year.
We are very good at responding to catastrophe. But the real test of our compassion is in daily life — we need not travel far to find people we can serve.
If our compassion lasted beyond immediate need and devastation, life would very likely look much different, not only for our neighbors but for us as well.
It is equally important to provide relief at home as it is to places devastated by disaster. By living according to the Golden Rule that we learned in the third grade — treat others the way you want to be treated — together, we can improve life here in Los Angeles just as we are in places struck by disaster

Last Tuesday, Google rocked cybersphere when it announced it would no longer be conforming to the “sanitized searches” endorsed by the Chinese government on
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Google.cn. China’s long history of media censorship was extended to search engines when Google made its multimillion dollar deal with the country’s dictatorship back in 2005.
In what many are now calling the web’s Berlin Wall moment, Google decided to rise up against Chinese censorship law in response to a hacking incident, which the search engine conglomerate has suggested was sponsored by the Chinese government. Competitive Internet giant Yahoo also stepped forward, using decidedly politicized language when it stated that it would be “aligned” with Google on the issue of Internet privacy. Even the U.S. Department of State decided to get involved, issuing a statement last Friday saying that it would demand a formal explanation from the Chinese government.
It is unclear at what point Google security became an issue of national importance — perhaps even national security — but what is certain is that this issue extends far beyond the rights of the everyday Chinese Internet user.
For Google, this was probably more of a scare tactic attempting to show the Chinese government who’s boss than an actual threat to close Google’s China enterprise; despite the very public fallout, Google only dropped its censorship controls on Google.cn for a number of hours. And, despite the high-and-mighty claim that Google would no longer collaborate with political oppressors, the company has returned to business as usual for the time being.
Google’s moral posturing seems somewhat questionable for several reasons. For one thing, if they really cared so much about so-called political oppression, then why did they agree to impose censorship models when they signed their initial contract? Some argue that Google’s CEOs were actually very worried about that issue from the beginning, yet felt that it would be better to provide some access to external world views than none at all. No doubt the thought of accessing more than a billion new potential users was also a strong incentive.
Furthermore, Google’s decision to take a strong stance probably has a lot more to do with protecting its assets (and its image) than the company’s political values. If the Chinese government was able to access Google’s highly lucrative intellectual property, the company could potentially face billions of dollars in losses. Equally important, if Google’s business clients fear that switching to Google Apps will compromise their security, it will be very hard to lure those important investors back out from behind their secure corporate servers.
Since the Chinese Communist Party conducted a business transaction with Google, this case creates several interesting questions from a political perspective. Google was essentially able to break Chinese law, without incurring any political consequences — because from Google’s perspective, the issue wasn’t Chinese law, but the terms of the Google.cn contract. China hacked first, so Google simply retaliated; the worst China can do is break its contract with Google.
This raises the second interesting point: If Google is able to break Chinese law without consequences, then does that make the company more powerful than the country? Probably not, but no doubt the Chinese government is livid that Google was able to take such swift and damaging action, not because of the company’s net power, but because of its technological superiority.
The political element only really came in when the U.S. Department of State decided to get involved. It’s possible that the State Department was simply using the Google issue to remind China that America still disapproves of Chinese political ideology. But the other, scarier possibility is that the State Department is actually worried that national security could be compromised via Chinese hackers on Google servers.
Technology has gone a long way toward meshing all areas of modern life in a way that’s never been seen before. But for businesses, business will always come first, and governments will always dwell mainly in politics. Though the two worlds have been brought into close collision, their interests are essentially aligned: As long as Google can make a profit off China, and China can modernize its country through Google, the two will continue to interact.
Either way, one thing is certain: China will now be more nervous than ever to tap into those technological assets, in whatever way they can.

So, if you read the first installment of “Digging Up the Backissues” and thought that you might get into comics, here’s another series to help you break into the medium, and just have a good story to read.
A Parisian man is murdered while guarding an ancient secret. Soon after, his friend and unlikely detective must track down the killer, and find out why the man was murdered, getting caught up in a centuries-long conspiracy involving secret societies and the Holy Grail. 
No, I’m not talking about The DaVinci Code. I’m talking about the single best comic book of the last decade, and a story created a few years before The DaVinci Code: Rex Mundi. While Dan Brown’s novel was a lackluster, disappointing thriller that relied solely on controversy for its success, Rex Mundi was a smart, creative mystery and political thriller that used a twist on the Holy Grail myth to explore faith, dogma and Machiavellian machinations.
Created by writer Arvid Nelson and artist EricJ, Rex Mundi is the story of the Holy Grail told as a murder mystery. Set in the 1930s, it is an alternate history where magic is real and the Protestant Reformation never happened, so robed, masked Inquisitors roam the streets, hunting down heretics and acting as the law.
The series works on many levels. The mystery that drives the plot is revealed gradually, with each revelation holding impact, and actually gets wrapped up rather well. In the background, a political crisis builds until it intertwines with the mystery of the Grail. Caught up in all of it is Doctor Julien Sauniere, a sharp, driven and moody character — almost a European Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe. Nelsons’ characters are fully rounded and in many ways the character drama is just as effective and compelling as the mystery.
The art is another highlight. The series goes through three artists in its run, and each artist’s style fits perfectly with the story. EricJ gives the initial story arcs a sharp, noir-style look, perfectly creating the urban feel of Paris. Jim Di Bartolo came onboard for a story set in the catacombs of the city, and his moody, atmospheric pencils only add to the suspenseful story. Juan Ferreyra finishes up the series with a softer, Art Nouvaue style as the story moves out of the city and into the sprawling countryside. Despite the different artists, the art always fits with the story, and a realism that permeates the series.
Smart, creative, and very compelling, Rex Mundi is the best comic of the decade. It takes a popular conspiracy and uses it to tell a suspenseful, genre-defying thriller that ultimately deconstructs the modern theories of the Holy Grail. Nelson and his artists have created a masterpiece for the medium, and a story that holds up among its prose cousins and rises above them.

With the U.S. job market slumping, some USC students are turning to the possibility of international careers — especially in China, with its dynamic market and booming economy.
The Zhongwen Club, in partnership with the USC Career Planning and Placement Center, is hosting an event today called “From Los Angeles to Beijing: Launching Your Career in China.” The event is a response to the growing interest in working abroad and aims to expose students to the opportunities available in the rapidly expanding Chinese job market.
“It’s getting harder to find jobs in the United States,” said Cleopatra Wise, president of the Zhongwen Club and a senior majoring in international relations and East Asian languages and cultures. “We thought having a professional event that would be open to the whole USC student body would be a good way to inform them about the opportunities in China.”
Clayton Dube, associate director of the U.S.-China Institute, said although there is no concrete data on the number of Americans who go to find jobs in China, evidence suggests the trend is on the rise.
“There’s considerable evidence that Americans, especially young Americans, are going to China to learn about China, to learn about themselves and to explore career opportunities,” Dube said.
Dube lived and worked in China in the 1980s. At the time, there was little enthusiasm among Americans for working in China, but he says interest has grown.
“One of the reasons why China is so attractive is that it is growing rapidly,” Dube said. “Many people are using this moment when there are few opportunities in the United States to try their luck in China.”
At the event, professionals with experience in a variety of fields — including economics, finance and education — will provide insight into China’s job market. They will address issues such as the cities and industries with the greatest demand for foreigners and what companies look for in American graduates.
“What we want [students] to walk away with is having a basic knowledge of what it’s like to work in China and knowing if China is a good move for them to start their careers because China honestly isn’t for everyone,” Wise said.
Hannah Watanabe-Rocco, a senior majoring in cinema, said she would consider looking for a job abroad because studying abroad in United Kingdom last fall made her want to experience other places.
“After going abroad now, I just want to see more of the world and explore more of the world,” Watanabe-Rocco said. “Another part of why I would consider going abroad is because I will take a job wherever I can get one because there are not very many opportunities here right now.”
Yewande Odetunde, a junior majoring in business administration and a participant in the Marshall School of Business’s Learning about International Commerce Program, which gives students the chance to explore the job market abroad for 10 days, said she would also consider working abroad after graduating.
She said she thinks working abroad would be beneficial to her because she is considering working for a multinational firm. Such experience, she said, would help her to better understand the cultures of customers and consequently to tailor products to them.
“Having a product that’s known around the world, you need to understand what [people’s] thought process is when using or thinking about using your product,” Odetunde said. “I want whatever career path I have to allow me the opportunity to communicate and interact internationally.”
Even with demand for foreign professionals with expertise in China, Dube said there are no guarantees for finding work. Doing well in China, he said, requires patience to learn the cultural customs and business practices, and depends on one’s willingness and flexibility to adapt to a new environment.
“China can be very challenging and it can be frustrating, but, if you are open-minded and adventurous, you will probably be able to find an opportunity,” Dube said.

A renowned Asian pop culture magazine that specializes in multimedia content is moving from Westwood to South LA. and will now be published at USC.
Asia Pacific Arts, an online magazine featuring interviews and music clips from Asian and Asian American artists is now being published by the USC US-China Institute in partnership with the USC East Asian Studies Center and the Annenberg School of Communication & Journalism. Until September, the magazine was published at the UCLA Asia Institute.
“The USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism views Asia Pacific Arts as a great opportunity to capitalize on and link several key programs at Annenberg: our growing global network of scholars and practitioners, especially in Asia, and our thriving programs in arts journalism and entertainment studies,” Carola Weil, associate dean for planning and strategic initiatives at Annenberg, told USC News.
With the switch in publisher, the magazine also went through a significant redesign and will soon be expanding its coverage.
Many USC students have already started contributing to the publication.

The push by USC Admissions to increase its number of visits to high schools around the world has led to a record number of freshman applications and a stronger applicant pool.
Daily Trojan | Vicki Yang
In the tough economy, many universities chose to cut their admissions travel budgets, decreasing visits to high schools. USC, meanwhile, set out to increase visits by 50 percent, aiming to attract more students from a wider variety of backgrounds. The return was about a 3 percent increase in freshman applications.
The Office of Admissions far exceeded its goal, visiting about 1,350 high schools, a 67 percent jump from last year. Though these 1,350 schools are only a few of the 30,000 high schools in the United States, Tim Brunold, associate dean and director of undergraduate admission, said the visits were integral in drawing a greater number of strong applicants to USC.
“We want to keep up the trend of delivering a freshman class that is more distinguished than the one before it,” Brunold said. “High school recruiting visits are one of the best ways to provide more high quality applicants.”
Brunold said the “volume and scope” of USC’s visits were “definitely beyond” those of other universities. USC spent $200,000 on travel for recruitment, which is  less than they had originally budgeted.
Aside from campus tours, surveys show that high school outreach visits have the greatest impact on generating applications, Brunold said. Applications from a particular school can as much as double after USC visits for the first time.
Wayne Thompson, a junior majoring in business administration, said colleges visiting his high school gave him a good picture of the university.
“It’s a tangible effect to be able to shake someone’s hand,” he said. “To converse in face just generates excitement.”
While USC visited the same number of California high schools as 2008, it increased its presence in the Southeast and Northeast, especially in highly populated states like Texas, Florida, Georgia, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. USC drew 6.8 percent and 4.3 percent more applicants from the Southeast and Northeast, respectively.
When determining which schools to visit, USC seeks the most return on resources spent by finding schools with achievement scores that match its target and that also have a large number of students that would be interested in coming to USC.
That approach seemed to work this year, as preliminary figures show that the average SAT score of this year’s applicants was 20 points higher than last year.
Kate Durkee, an undeclared freshman, said USC mailings and a desire to move West were enough to persuade her to apply. But she said she would have liked to see USC make an effort to visit her Maryland high school. Nonetheless, she applauded this year’s increased visits.
“It makes the school more competitive,” she said. “Our reputation has already gone up, and this will create only more opportunities for all of us.”
Jordan Roberts, a freshman majoring in architecture, said about 50 students attended a USC information session at his school, six of whom went on to enroll.
“The visit did not make me want to apply anymore than I already did, but I was happy to have my financial aid questions answered directly,” he said.
A visit encouraged Stephanie Tong, a junior majoring in business administration, to apply not only because the recruiter sold the city and debunked the stigma associated with USC but also because of his attire.
“The USC officer wore a suit, and it showed that he really cared about his and the school’s persona,” she said. “It brought a level of professionalism when other schools had people come looking casual.”
Similar was the experience of Kevin Song, a junior majoring in business administration.
“It was good to hear all the benefits from one person traveling to us, instead of 50 of us going down to Los Angeles,” he said.
On the international level, USC reached 15 more schools this year. There was a 60 percent increase in applications from China and 10 percent increase from South Korea.
Although Brunold added two recruiters this year specifically for international visits, he said that number should increase as USC makes a push into India, Latin America and Canada, areas where the number of applicants did not change.
Despite the increase in applications, Brunold says the enrollment target remains 2,600 freshman, which will lower the admittance rate from 24 percent. 
As for next year, Brunold said he expects to keep being aggressive with a goal of “meeting every student that is a match for USC.”
usc news also says that usc recieved 35,753 applications for the fall 2009 class.

which one is right?
Don’t go to school at USC but I assume now that UC system is crambling, it is a chance for USC and other private schools to capitalize on it
enlightened, why do I smell Bruin coming off of you in waves?
You’re speaking without an ounce of personal experience and it shows. Yes, we all know that south of USC is not a pleasant place, and that Westwood is among “the real glitz of LA”. We know that UCLA has better academic faculty in general, and that UCLA focuses more on research than does USC. Never once do we deny these things.
Yet I find it hard to believe that you do not have enough class to shed these stereotypes, stop attacking the rival school, and admit that both schools are excellent. Our core curriculum may limp behind, but academically-motivated students will find that Thematic Option (the honors curriculum) will more than satisfy their intellectual itch. Besides the football team, we have many things that UCLA does not have—an undergraduate business program, an octopus (far-reaching, fast-hitting, sucking in more applicants than ever) of a film school, the Annenberg School of Communication. Sure, south of USC is gritty, but who is closer to the heart of LA, to downtown, to Pershing Square, to the Gold Line which extends to Little Tokyo and Chinatown? Hollywood gets stale when you’re not a tourist, I imagine. On top of it all, we smile and extend open palms when we meet a Bruin. Why, “enlightened”, why do you not have that sort of class? If you are a Bruin now, you don’t deserve to be one.
I think USC’s administration should be a lot more wary, “because the recruiter sold the city and debunked the stigma associated with USC but also because of his attire.” So how did the recruiter “sell” the city? It’s Los Angeles, the 2nd most populated city in the U.S. and perhaps the 6th or 7th in the world. It’s very dangerous, especially in this part. You come out when it’s dark, and you’re open game. I laugh when there is euphemism used to “sell” the glamour of USC’s geographic location. There are lots of naive students who attend here, and the DPS notifications and statistics attest to that. Stop kidding yourself USC, you know damn well that the selling this university has led to blood on your hands. I don’t want to bring up past, but not so distant, tragic events. 
Oh yeah, and the “stigma,” of what? That USC is still an overpriced party school. 
If want to attend a school with competitive academics and a much more stringent admission pool, it’s that school across town that may get it’s butt kicked in football by ‘SC, but nonetheless, they’re still a public Ivy. Oh yeah, they border Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, WESTWOOD and other affluent towns–the real glitz of L.A.–where you won’t be in danger when it’s dark.
The grand total of freshman applicants is?

A cloud of debate hangs high in the Tibetan Plateau of the Himalayas. On one side, the Tibetans and their supporters have, for the past 50 years, fought for independence and genuine autonomy. Sympathy lies with the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama. Further, countless human rights violations against the Tibetans are claimed to have occurred at the hands of the Chinese government. On the other side, Beijing has retained an iron grip on the political and cultural aspects of the region it claims as Southern China. 
The controversial saga between China and Tibet was revisited Tuesday, thawing the silence since the last talks ended in November 2008. Chinese President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice President Xi Jinping attended the meeting with the Dalai Lama’s envoys at the other end of the table. Some scholars believe this surprising ninth round of talks may indicate that China is offering an olive branch of sorts to its neighbor.
The Chinese government-backed Xinhua News Agency reported that diplomats at the meeting discussed improving the living standards of the Tibetan people to national levels by 2020. Indeed, the Chinese government has taken strides to develop Tibet economically by providing incentives for Han Chinese to migrate there, creating jobs and infrastructure in the process.
But while increased standards of living are nice, the people of Tibet are probably more concerned with their political status. The Dalai Lama’s government-in-exile is bent on achieving genuine autonomy and holding the religion, culture and well-being of his people as the top priority.
Early in the talks, the Chinese government refused to remove its military presence in the densely populated regions of Tibet — judging from this result, progress may be harder to achieve than expected. Perhaps this round of talks is just another demonstration by China to push its consistent hard-line approach on Tibet.
Admittedly, I am certainly not in the Chinese camp on this issue. After fatefully discovering the tenuous China-Tibet issue during my junior year of high school, I was convinced that the Chinese government was purposefully exploiting and eliminating the rich Tibetan culture. Accounts by imprisoned nuns and dissidents only inflamed my reaction. Reading up on the International Campaign for Tibet, it seemed obvious at the time that China was, simply, the bad guy.
Andrew Laskowski | Daily Trojan
Today, I can’t say with certainty that I’ve completely abandoned that thought. I’d like to think that some of my idealistic naïveté has ebbed and China’s reasons for claiming Tibet are not completely unfounded. After all, it’s difficult to give up such valuables as mineral resources and an opportunity to display its clout and potential to develop Tibet as a Chinese cosmopolitan region. Additionally, the issue probably contains more complexities than are apparent. Nonetheless, China’s global reputation is hazy, and this round of stagnant talks doesn’t do much to change that opinion.
Needless to say, China is a great country with an even greater potential to rival the United States. The National Bureau of Statistics of China is reporting very optimistic statistics for its economy — gross domestic product growth of about 9 percent and a stable unemployment rate less than 5 percent. The rise of the Chinese dragon, as they call it, is happening as we speak. Yet, its rise may not be met with much sustained success if its reputation isn’t detoxified.
From the most recent reports of the eviction of thousands of Chinese residents for building development, to the alleged hacking attacks on Google, China’s international character is not getting a good rap nowadays. Don’t forget its controversial tussle with the Uighurs in 2009, which resulted in 200 deaths and a messy affair for Beijing to clean up.
If China wants to play the game and compete with the rest of the world, perhaps it ought to play by the rules. For China, arriving at stalemate after stalemate with the Dalai Lama only creates a more tense relationship and doesn’t achieve much else. The Danish Foreign minister Per Stig Møller called on both parties to ultimately allow for the Tibetans to “attain genuine self-rule, with cultural and religious freedom and respect for human rights within the framework of the Chinese constitution.”
The United Kingdom’s junior Foreign Office Minister Ivan Lewis added, “Peaceful dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama’s representatives is the only way to bring about a lasting and peaceful solution to the problems in Tibet.”
Though open-mindedness can’t hurt the relationship, it certainly isn’t enough. China has failed not only to hold peaceful dialogues, it has also—more importantly — manifested its anti-Dalai Lama and anti-autonomy notions through its actions. It is time China matches the thrust of its global and political influence with behavior that is supported by a clear conscience, and this round of talks is the perfect opportunity to do so.

I am wondering, have the author ever been to China?
There are more than one sides of this issue. While it’s true that China’s (re)conquest of Tibet in 1957 was motivated by the region’s natural resources and strategic location, it’s also true that Tibet was a feudal state where the vast majority were slaves and serfs owned by elites like the Dalai Lama and his handlers. China freed the slaves, built schools and hospitals, cured polio and smallpox, and is slowly but surely improving economic opportunities for native Tibetans. China will never give up the territory, and the Dalai Lama will never get his slaves back, so if that’s how you define “progress” you’re going to be disappointed. 
As a major economic partner of China, our role should be to encourage China to embrace reforms that increase individual freedom and protect human rights *generally* (throughout China). That’s a realistic kind of “progress” that can improve life for all of China’s citizens, including the Tibetan people.

It has not been an auspicious week for American space travel.
The California State Historical Resources Commission voted last week to officially commemorate more than 100 items of space junk, a list that includes two urine collection devices and four motion sickness receptacles (known affectionately as barf bags by those who frequent Disneyland’s Tower of Terror).
The historical scent of galactic bodily fluids had barely cleared from the air when newspapers across the country began reporting that President Barack Obama is planning to place a moratorium on space travel to the moon and Mars, and instead place the burden of exploration on private companies.
The New York Times reported Thursday that the budget Obama will unveil to Congress this week will allocate $100 billion to NASA over the next four years; the majority of the money will go to private companies to provide shuttles to the International Space Station. The two capsules NASA has already spent billions of dollars engineering will be retired.
The implications of the plan raise serious questions about NASA’s place in the future of space travel, a field it once proudly held a vice-grip on.
The shelving of the two space shuttles will cut at least a third of the 15,000 jobs at Kennedy Space Center according to the New York Times, a number only slightly offset by the estimated 1,700 jobs outsourced launchings could create in Florida.
Obama’s budget will also effectively sound the death knell for the Constellation program, NASA’s five-year-old initiative to develop spacecrafts that would return astronauts to the moon and perhaps even chart a manned mission to Mars. The program’s two figurehead capsules, the Ares I and the Orion, have already cost NASA $9 billion — an amount large enough to question the rationale of Obama’s budget.
Outsourcing the construction of space shuttles away from NASA’s 50-plus years of experience is risky business; no private company has the equivalent know-how or knowledge of safety protocol, and, with space travel still an infant field, safety is paramount.
The budget leaves little wiggle room for scientific advancement. The Orlando Sentinel, the first periodical to report the forthcoming budget changes, did quote White House officials as saying NASA will eventually be tasked with developing “heavy-lift” rockets that will explore beyond Earth’s orbit — but this will probably not come to fruition for decades.
There can be no denying that outer space is not at the forefront of the administration’s focus; in its slow rebound from economic recession, the United States has much to battle without leaving the atmosphere. Under the planned budget, NASA will be utilized to combat problems closer to home, most significantly climate change.
Yet, despite economic woes, it’s hard not to see Obama’s budget as the end of an era for American space travel. Terrestrial technology is growing with leaps and bounds, as new, ill-named gadgets are announced with the pomp and circumstance of rocket launchings.
The frontier that once seemed conquerable is now receding from America’s focus. The United States has given NASA the backseat in the space race in favor of entrepreneurship. It may be a small step forward for commercial companies, but it’s a giant leap backward for American space travel.

Recently, Billy Corgan announced that his seminal ’90s band the Smashing Pumpkins would be releasing its first album since their 2007 comeback, Zeitgeist. This time, however, the lead singer has shed the only other founding member — drummer Jimmy Chamberlin — and is soldiering on as the sole remaining tie to the original Smashing Pumpkins.
The fool · The 44 songs on Teargarden by Kaleidyscope are inspired by Tarot cards and their characters. Above, watercolor album artwork. - Photo courtesy of TheSmashingPumpkins.com 
The new album — whimsically titled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope — not only features a new drummer, 19–year–old Mike Byrne, but a new deployment scheme. While 2000’s Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music was subversively distributed online, it was mostly a plot to undermine Virgin Records’ unwillingness to give the Pumpkins a double album. Kaleidyscope, on the other hand, is being released as part of a web-based project that Corgan describes in several interviews as a way to bypass the process by which art is made and delivered.
The 44-song concept album, which is still being written, will be distributed digitally — one song at a time — until there is enough to realize Corgan’s vision of an 11 EP box set. More importantly, Corgan’s plan includes infinite amounts of no-strings-attached song downloading directly from the band’s official website.
Thankfully, the two songs that have been released so far are a positive introduction. “Widow Wake My Mind” sounds like Corgan’s more upbeat work with his side project Zwan and “Song For A Son,” which seems like a boring ballad at first, eventually layers guitars beautifully and a pretty awesome guitar solo.
Although the songs don’t resemble those sun–kissed, nostalgic songs of the Pumpkins’ earlier work (“Today,” “Soma,” “Crush”) or their songs that, quite frankly, rock (“Siva,” “Geek U.S.A.”), there’s no doubt that Corgan is still a very talented songwriter and some of his great harmonies are still apparent. But with only two songs released since Dec. 8 (the second arrived on Jan. 18) the entire experiment could take years to culminate.
Despite the fact that this is an experimental form of releasing music, Corgan’s complex history as the driving force behind the Smashing Pumpkins has prepared him. When Corgan brought the Smashing Pumpkins together in 1988, he expressed that he wanted the band to be his own artistic vision. He brought in James Iha, D’arcy Wretzky and Jimmy Chamberlin as bandmates, but their presence has long been regarded as a façade of cool ’90s diversity that masked Corgan’s one-man show. Corgan not only wrote all the music for the band, but it has been rumored he snuck into the studio at night and re-recorded over the others’ parts. Corgan’s control over the band can’t be denied and it’s debatable whether or not the Smashing Pumpkins were ever really a band, an argument that rings even more true now. Corgan has acknowledged this dilemma, writing on his blog that the band is “just a name, THE Smashing Pumpkins.”
Despite questions to the Pumpkins’ current validity, however, Corgan’s exclusively downloadable release could be extremely successful, partly because Corgan embraced the Internet so early on. After the band officially broke up in 2000, Corgan took its album underground. Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music was released by giving 25 vinyl copies to friends and prominent fans,  complete with permission and instructions for online redistribution. A decade later, with the height of Corgan’s career far behind him, it might just be his current low profile that allows him to again be successful with the Internet in a way that artists trying to reach their peak could only hope for.
Regardless of whether Corgan’s new releases are successful or a total failure, at least a few people will be paying attention to the Pumpkins’ next move because of the intrigue. The story of the band’s career is one filled with huge success (Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Siamese Dream), backstabbing (Corgan publicly declared that he hated his fellow Pumpkins) and major pitfalls (drug abuse, depression, Corgan’s embarrassing blogs). And with a 44-song box set being created at this moment, it can only get more interesting.
Terrific article!  Informative, concise, and topically newsworthy,  Bravo, Ms. Geoghan.
This is really something to look forward to-‘one song at a time’…  I didn’t know about this. A whole new way of distributing music, bypassing the middle men, it sounds like.   And songs based on Tarot Cards??  It is ‘intriguing’!
Really great article. Thanks! Will be watching and waiting for the rest to come out.
Awsome article!  Go Corgan! Life always has yet another chapter to write.

Amid all the news about the State of the Union address and the faltering health care bill, a lot of foreign policy news has slipped under the radar, including one event that could dramatically affect U.S.-China relations for the next decade. It is serious, dangerous to international relations and somewhat illogical.
Recently, the United States authorized a $6.4 billion weapon sale to Taiwan. In response, China has threatened to impose sanctions and to withdraw from any military exchanges with the United States. Even the state-run media has taken the initiative, criticizing the United States. The China Daily claimed that the arms sale “inevitably cast a long shadow on Sino-U.S. relations.”
This sudden anger over arms sales is new for China. Although the United States officially recognized the People’s Republic in the 1970s, it has continued to supply weapons to Taiwan ever since. Arms sales to Taiwan are not new. So why would China be so angry?
China has been claiming Taiwan as part of its territory for years and reunification, be it diplomatic or militaristic, has long been part of its policy. Arms sales to Taiwan present a problem for China, even if China’s military vastly outnumbers its island neighbor’s.
It’s not the why, but the how of China’s reaction that is most vexing. Sanctions on the United States? Why would a rapidly developing nation try to hurt the economy of one of its biggest trading partners? China and the United States are inextricably linked; China is major buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds, while the United States is a major client of Chinese economy. Halting free trade between the two is detrimental to both sides, and China should know that.
It is not as if U.S.-China relations are strong right now. The recent mess over Google brought China’s Internet censorship to light and angered the United States. Add in the ever-present human rights issues with China, and the two nations are not exactly super friendly.
Ultimately, it seems that China is just flexing its muscles. The global recession is over, and recovery is beginning, and China feels like the time is right to assert its power. While it took a blow in the recession, China still had a positive growth. It is an economic powerhouse, possesses one of the strongest militaries in the world and, unlike its competitors, came out of last year’s mess relatively ahead.
Since China is in a relatively good position in the world, it would seem as if it would be trying to court international powers. This move, however, only threatens international security and trade. More than likely, this is just going to earn China the ire of the other members of the United Nations and possibly some counter threats of sanctions on China.
Still, for all of China’s claims and threats, it is most likely that the deal will ultimately go through. China is a major power in the 21st century, and knows it, and that means knowing when to not spoil a good deal. The U.S.-Sino ties, both economic and political, are too important for either country to do something so stupid.
China forced its hand and came out looking impulsive. The arms sale might or might not be right, but China’s reaction to it clearly displays a naïveté and arrogance in its place within the international community. While it might not like Taiwan increasing its arms, a few more Taiwanese ships are less threatening to China than trade barriers and more enemies. So in this case, China should just let trade go through and reap the benefits of free commerce in the global community.
China’s arrogance might stem from its strength in the world, but if it keeps up this blustering foreign policy, it may do more harm in the long run. Being a rich nation doesn’t take much wisdom, but being a powerful nation does.

The chinese know that we are screwed economically, they just want to give that extra little push to start the snowball effect.
We owe alot of money to them, in fact…. the national debt now is so bad that it is impossible to pay back, perhaps what people dont understand its not a matter of “IF” but rather a matter of “WHEN” the US will declare bankrupcy.
By impossible to repay i mean…. if we were to confiscate every penny of US currency from every single bank, business and citizen and use it to repay debt, we would still be highly in debt, not to mention destroy the economy.

On most mornings, I leave my apartment looking forward to the day ahead of me. I swing open the front door and mount my bike, eager to ride through campus on a beautiful Southern California day. That is, until I notice a haze dulling the morning sky. Alas, I try to convince myself that it’s just another day in Los Angeles. 
Perhaps three semesters at USC has acclimated me to the infamous L.A. smog. Before coming to USC, I’d never seen auto shops offer smog check services. Now, it’s common to notice a smog check sign on a corner, though it is more often than not partially obscured by a layer of smog. Yet when I return to my suburban Texas hometown or visit other cities, I find that I simply can’t accept that smog is normal. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, Southern California smog levels exceed health standards for more than 80 days a year. No wonder.
In a new study published by Nature, springtime winds from South and East Asia carry substantial smog-causing ozone to the Western United States. This cross-border pollution has dramatically affected both industrial and rural regions of the Pacific United States. In our case, it only worsens the air quality and spoils the otherwise pleasant bike rides to class.
Last December’s United Nations climate change talks held in Copenhagen was a hopeful first step taken by the international society to combat climate change and deforestation — problems that have long been unattended to. However, it concluded on a tenuous note. The Copenhagen Accords, released this week, seeks to tie up loose ends. Its goal is to prevent global warming from increasing beyond a 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit rise from levels in pre-industrial times. More than 80 developed and developing countries signed the accord with their individual emission reduction plans, but no hard deadline for curbing greenhouse gas emissions or any enforcement provision was put in place.
Daily Trojan | Andrew Laskowski
The United States’ goal is to cut emissions in the range of 17 percent from levels five years ago. China, who had been taciturn and resistant in Copenhagen, signed on to a more specific agreement, promising to make sure the rate of emissions doesn’t surpass economic growth. Singapore, an influential nation that boasts the world’s second busiest port, made a similar decision, albeit one that clearly exemplifies the self-interest that governs all states in an international society. Singapore seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 16 percent below current levels but only if the other countries agree to a strong, legally binding deal.
For states, it appears the obligation to one another overrides any moral obligation, such as the duty to environmental protection.
In fact, climate change is the perfect game theory scenario: Why should country A yield to curbing greenhouse gases if country B doesn’t? Should country A compromise its industrial production and influence in order to do the morally right thing by addressing the global warming issue?
With this mindset and at this rate, it is unlikely that President Obama will see his spearheaded effort of combating climate change succeed in the near future. As Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists said, “The pledges put on the table to date do not put us on track to meet that goal and will make it very difficult for us politically and technically beyond 2020 to meet that target.”
Indeed, it’ll be interesting to see how next year’s Mexico City summit will pan out. The Copenhagen conference drafted a rudimentary outline of each country’s emission goals ­­— but next year’s delegations will have the challenge of filling in the gaps that were too large to tackle in Copenhagen.
It is said that ingenuity is born of necessity. If this isn’t an urgent, much-needed point in our history, then I don’t know what is. If we can feel the negative byproduct of human activity and other sources of climate change wafting over from across the Pacific Ocean, it must be a sign that climate change is a pressing global concern.
So at this urgent time, what we need is some kind of ingenuity to redefine the model of how the international society of states, or of organizations or people, perceive production, development and progress. Is there not a way to thrive as developed or developing countries while respecting the environment? Perhaps we have just been functioning too long in this age-old outlook of leaving the environment at the bottom of our priorities that we don’t realize we could rethink the model.
Converting to a Greenpeace activist is not the solution. An applied realization that we have a moral obligation to the planet is not only a responsible act but it could also help to overcome the frustrating impasse encountered repeatedly by states.

Let me just point out the stupidest sentence in the article: “If we can feel the negative byproduct of human activity and other sources of climate change wafting over from across the Pacific Ocean, it must be a sign that climate change is a pressing global concern.” Whether or not there is ozone coming over the Pacific Ocean from Asia (I haven’t read that report), that fact tells you nothing about “climate change”. How *must* it be a sign? The very choice of the bet-hedging term “climate change” indicates that you, too, are doubtful of the theory of global warming. If the theory is right, shouldn’t it be getting warmer? Finally, how can you write an entire article headlined “Global warming does not have political ties” without mentioning Climategate or engaging with any of those who might argue that “global warming” DOES have political ties?
“Climate change has been happening since long before man’s evil emissions.” True.
Nature is more powerful than man. Science is not over, man still has plenty to learn.
It does not have political ties? There are many scientists who say it does not even exist! Climate change has been happening since long before man’s evil emissions.

2010-02-07,USC,China,"For the past few years, USC has earned the honor of being the university with the largest international student population, but competition — even for this large number of spots — may be getting tougher.
The undergraduate applicant pool for the graduating class of 2014 has seen a steep increase this application season in the number of international applications and an even more dramatic increase in the number of applications from China.
According to the USC Office of Admission, the number of international applicants has risen by 22 percent this year. The number of Chinese international applicants, however, is up by three times that, rising 66 percent.
“That’s not an uncommon occurrence,” said Tim Brunold, associate dean and director of undergraduate admission. “The applications have been increasing from international students at a very steady pace for several years now.”
Brunold noted that this increase is not specific to USC.
“I believe that it is consistent with other universities. I do think that there is a general sense among many American colleges and universities that China is a good place to go recruit students,” Brunold said. “I think that this growing trend of China is going to be something that will be with us for a while.”
Still, Brunold attributed the steep rise to applications to USC from Chinese applications to an increased outreach effort by USC Admissions.
“There’s always been a lot of interest from Chinese students at our graduate level,” he said. “But more recently, China has really taken over the top spot in our freshman recruiting.”
While the number of applications might be higher, Brunold said the percentage of Chinese applicants admitted to USC has remained similar to the overall average of acceptances over the past two years. For the 2012 graduating class, 14.5 percent of Chinese applicants were admitted, and 29 percent of Chinese applicants were admitted into the 2013 graduating class, compared to an overall admissions rate of 24 percent for the class of 2013.
Though Brunold expects the number of applicants from China to continue to rise, he said the university does not necessarily plan on increasing enrollment.
“Every indication we have is that it will continue to rise. That also means though, just like with any other group of students, it is going to get more competitive. Whenever you have more applicants, there’s more competition,” Brunold said.
He added that the university is “very pleased” with having a freshmen international population around 10 to 12 percent, but that this is simply a “natural balance” and by no means a goal for the admission office.
According to Brunold, China tops the list of the five countries outside of the United States that send the most undergraduate applications to USC. The other four countries, in order, are South Korea, India, Canada and Taiwan.
Students from China who come to USC said the hands-on learning experience offered by American universities is a draw. Some also noted that USC is well-known in China, which helps it draw applicants.
Yingying Zhang, a graduate student studying computer science, completed her undergraduate degree in China before coming to the United States for graduate school. She said she believes the university system in the United States is very different from that of China, and she wanted to gain hands-on experience in her field of study.
“In my undergraduate university, our courses focus on theories, not implementation or practice. Some students just care about their grades, not real skills,” Zhang said, adding that she hopes to gain “skills and experience” at USC.
Ruoqi Zhou, a freshman majoring in international relations (global business), applied to many colleges, all in the United States, and believed that she would learn more at USC than back home in China.
“The United States’ environment and education is better for me to accomplish my dream,” said Zhou, who said she hopes to become a journalist.

A few days ago, I tried to persuade a friend to take the bus with me to run some errands off campus. The reluctant response I got was one I’ve been hearing since my first visit to USC.
“Dude. There are some really sketchy people around here.”
I won’t attempt to deny that the South Los Angeles neighborhood punctuated by our red brick-and-ivy campus is not exactly the Hamptons. But I can’t get past the idea that it gets a worse rap than it necessarily deserves because it’s a working-class community, and maybe it’s different from what we were used to at home. We judge it for that. Unfortunately, we tend to apply the same preconceptions to people.
When Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the failed Nigerian Christmas Day bomber, was taken into federal custody, it didn’t take long for Republicans to start blasting the way the government treated him, which they felt was lenient and not appropriate when addressing a terrorist threat to national security.
Abdulmutallab’s case has been handled judiciously and within the confines of the law. Still, many feel that it is not good enough for a situation such as this.
The reason for our discomfort is obvious: Abdulmutallab is a terrorist, and terrorist attacks often make us so nervous as to forget that we are a nation that tries every individual fairly and by the same set of laws.
America’s fear of foreigners, especially Muslims — a xenophobia found close to home, as well — often causes us to try to ignore the very rights and liberties that we claim separate us from them.
The obstructionist-type critics who have condemned the Obama administration’s handling of the incident have been so eager to protect our country from people like Abdulmutallab that they have overlooked a lack of constitutional basis for their claims.
Consider their main arguments: The defendant was to be tried in a civilian court, not a military one, and that he was read his Miranda rights.
Let’s take a moment here.  
Abdulmutallab is a civilian accused of breaking civilian law on U.S. territory. He didn’t perform a military attack, he wasn’t arrested by the military and he’s not a prisoner of war. There is no constitutional reason that he shouldn’t be tried in a civilian court. This comes down to a case of Republicans trying to push him off into the military system in an attempt to work around the civil rights he would be afforded otherwise.
Miranda rights apply to every defendant accused under our court of law, whether they be terrorists or shoplifters. They can’t be suspended simply because a particular individual makes us more nervous than others. This is a crucial part of our nation’s legal system. It’s what sets us apart from Iran or China — that the person in custody is afforded his basic human rights, no matter who he is, where he’s from or what he’s done.
Our nation prides itself on being unique, on representing fairness and equality. Why not put to use these laws that we are so passionate about defending? Abdulmutallab’s failed attack on Northwest Flight 253, foiled by a defective homemade detonator, was well-documented, with a plane full of witnesses and a syringe full of evidence.
Even in a fair and impartial trial, Miranda rights and all, he is likely to be convicted. And a conviction in such a manner is an opportunity to reinstate in the world’s eyes the idea that, regardless of the background or crimes of the accused, we play by the rules we’ve set for ourselves. To call for unlawful treatment of Abdulmutallab is a waste of that opportunity, recalling instead the less constitutionally supported treatment of prisoners such as those in Guantanamo Bay.
In an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, John Brennan, defended the federal government’s conduct, declaring, “we reacted very well to that situation. He was then put into a process that has been the same process that we have used for every other terrorist who has been captured on our soil — whether they be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens.”
This last addendum to his statement is an acknowledgment of the fact that prejudice against foreigners is definitely a pathological issue in cases such as these.
Race and religion are key factors in the critical response that has surrounded Abdulmutallab’s treatment. There’s little point in denying that we as a society get more nervous and demand harsher treatment of an accused terrorist when he’s Muslim.
When Oklahoma City was bombed in 1995, an exhaustive search for the culprit ended in a shocked and confused nation being handed U.S. Army veteran Timothy McVeigh, an Irish Catholic from New York. People had heard the word “terrorism” and automatically looked toward the vague, frightening population of non-white, non-Christian outsiders.
No one demanded that McVeigh’s Miranda rights be suspended.
Brennan was right to defend the actions of our government in this instance. “Counterterrorism professionals deserve the support of our Congress … rather than [Congress] second-guessing what they’re doing on the ground.”
Those professionals acted constitutionally, and any complaints that they did not are the result of either a bias against foreign nationals or the exploitation of that fear for partisan purposes — what Brennan referred to as the “political football” that Republican critics are currently tossing around.
The federal government should be congratulated for conducting Abdulmutallab’s case in a fair and unbiased way, in spite of our painful history with — and nervousness around, — people of his religious background and inclinations. In order to be a nation of equality that we claim to be, we must ensure that the same constitutional rights are granted to every defendant in our court of law, whether we feel safe around them or not.

Hey Diane,
I personally thought what made the U.S. constitution unique for its time was that the founders believed that these unalienable rights applied to all men not just american citizens… “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that ALL MEN are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights”
btw i know i was quoting the declaration…
Hey Diane,
Suspending legal rights for a political agenda is soooo last-administration, dontcha think?
Hey Kastalia sweetie, for better or worse, Tim McVeigh was an AMERICAN CITIZEN. That’s probably why no one demanded his Miranda rights be suspended, doncha think?

Prevailing wisdom states that proficiency in multiple languages is an invaluable tool for experiences like studying abroad or perhaps making a good impression; Americans admire those who have managed to become fluent in at least one language other than English. But to others, like our European counterparts, being fluent in at least two languages other than their native tongue is commonplace. So why is that notion so foreign to Americans?
President Theodore Roosevelt once said, “We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language.”
As absurd and provincial as it might sound, it still resonates with many Americans today. Though we might try to pride ourselves on our cultured outlook, well-traveled backgrounds or ideals, our mind-set regarding learning languages hasn’t shifted much from Roosevelt’s. We still operate under the assumption that English is the sole lingua franca.
The Center for Applied Linguistics recently conducted a survey revealing that many schools have dropped foreign language instruction because public elementary and middle schools have largely ceased such programs.
Fundamentally, the education system roughly demonstrates the idea that there is no need to consider foreign languages in our everyday interactions. In fact, only 9 percent of Americans speak a foreign language, compared to 44 percent of Europeans.
Our education system has generally relegated the learning of a foreign language to the privileged, the college-bound or the less science-inclined, which tacitly asserts that knowing a foreign language is not a priority. Rather, it’s a necessary activity only for those studying or working abroad.
Although most schools in the United States do offer foreign language instruction — mainly in French and Spanish — it often begins late in a student’s career, by which time the brain is significantly less adept at absorbing a new language.

Interestingly enough, though most foreign language instruction in the United States is waning, interest in Chinese is on the rise. The proportion of elementary and high schools offering instruction in Chinese has increased four-fold within the past decade. In addition, the College Board reports that the Chinese Advanced Placement test is quickly surpassing German as the third most taken foreign language AP test.
Yet authors, linguists and educators are wary about the permanence of this sudden surge in learning Chinese in schools, especially kindergarten and elementary schools. It doesn’t take a genius to realize that Chinese is gaining popularity because China is quickly assuming a role as the United States’ greatest competitor. Students realize that having a working knowledge of Chinese will give them an advantage in the business world and for the myriad opportunities that are becoming increasingly available.
This is a case of déjà vu: Interest in learning Russian skyrocketed during the 1980s, before Japanese ran its course in the 1990s, and Arabic became popular after Sept. 11.
While American educators realize the benefits of learning a foreign language early in a child’s life, what about the rest of us? Will Americans really be convinced to learn Chinese and break the mind-set that English is the universal language?
At this point, it is unlikely Americans will make the necessary psychological shift to embrace knowing a foreign language as well as, say, basic algebra. As Susan Jacoby, author of The Age of American Unreason, said, “The fad for Chinese will pass — born, like the promotion of Russian studies during the Cold War, out of the idea that we must know the language of our chief competitor.”
Sadly enough, Jacoby’s prediction might be true, as our bias toward English and our complacence for genuinely embracing diversity have hindered us from becoming the true global citizens we emulate.

I think learning a second language is reasonable if one goes to a foregin country.
But lets get serious about learning things.
I was in Shiyan China in November of 2008.  What is needed in this nation is that the old people should start doing physical exercies like the Chinese I saw.  They were out there by the hundreds.
I saw some old guy getting off of a bus.  I wanted to ask his age but I was told it would be impolite.  I did not ask.

Terrence, the old guy’s age was 68.
I agree with Teddy and Rich. Learning a language is fun, and has been very enriching to my life, but it is not a priority or a necessity. Interestingly, I spent several semesters learning French and Japanese in high school and as a college student, never to really use either of them, but gained semi-fluency in Chinese after graduating, while I worked in China. Looking back, I think that wasting time on languages in schools was kind of a status symbol, something I was able to do because I wasn’t studying a “hard” subject like medicine or engineering. Frankly I wish I’d spent more of my undergrad years acquiring practical knowledge instead of “finding myself”, which is really just another word for putting off responsibility.
Teddy Roosevelt was a racist, and ironically the U.S. is considered the current Roman Empire. But we’ll see how long that lasts. I am patriotic, but not nationalistic. English was almost overturned by German as the official language in the early part of U.S. history. English should be the official language throughout the U.S. The founding fathers of MY country were “dead old white men.” Were these dead old white men myopic then? Absolutely, however, some traditions should persist, like–the English language!
The only reason Chinese language is on an upswing is because China’s recent rise in economic prowess. But alas, it’ll burst a la the Japanese economy. 
Enjoy your 15-minutes China, the world isn’t impressed by your shoddy, mass-produced merchandise.
america makes shoddy products too and at ten times the cost! American auto companies are certainly not competitive and electronics have had that same reputation for decades. maybe we make better financial products–on second thought those are shite too…hmmm at least we make better weapons of mass destruction!
Nadine, thanks for writing this article. It’s something more Americans need to hear, even though I agree that most of them probably will never see the value of learning a foreign language. You also could have included the statistic that less than a third of Americans even have passports and a great number have never even left their hometown. Not hard to see why they don’t think learning languages is important. 
@ Rich, your comments are as ignorant as Teddy Roosevelt’s. Since when did speaking another language make you less American? Have you forgotten that this country is a land of immigrants? Do you think the 44% of Europeans who speak another language consider themselves less nationalistic because of it? English is the official language of the US. So what? French is the official language of France and you’ll find lots of people there who speak other languages.
What are “other countries standards”? Furthermore, what are “American standards”? One of the things that makes America great is that it embraces people from everywhere and our culture is a hodgepodge. People who immigrate to America and then choose to isolate themselves within their own culture without integrating is one thing, but diversity is GOOD for America and sets a positive example for the rest of the world.
Teddy Rosevelt also said that we have no room for 50/50 pct Americanism in this country…what he is saying is that we need to protect our culture so we dont get overran by other cultures ala the Roman empire. You are eitther 100% American, or you are not an American at all, period. I agree with his sentiments, and we are seeing today that letting people live here by their contries standards is not a good thing for America. There still isnt any room for 50/50 Americanism, and Englisg IS the official language here. That being said, we need some to learn foreign languages, but the need to live in America as a bilingual citizen is really not needed to be successful.

Most students have to go overseas for the chance to share a classroom with students from an international university, but a select group of USC students will have the opportunity to do so from Los Angeles.
A hand-selected class of 12 undergraduate students from USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering and Marshall School of Business are pioneers in a new, innovative approach to videoconferencing technology.
Using technology known as the i-Podium, the Principle and Practice of Global Innovation Teams class shares lectures with students from Peking University in Beijing on a biweekly basis.
“The ‘i’ in i-Podium stands for international, innovative, interactive, immersive, integrated, interchange, infusion and the combination of all the above,” said  Stephen Lu, a professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering and Viterbi’s David Packard endowed chair.
Lu, who is pioneering the pilot program, emphasized that the technology is not particularly innovative, but its use is groundbreaking.
“It’s not about the technology but the way they let us use it,” Lu said. “It speeds up the scale of delivery.”
This is the first year USC has partnered with PKU to offer this new strategy, branching off of the Distance Education Network. Lu lectures for his stand-in class at USC while a monitor projects the same lecture to his other classroom at PKU.
The PKU students are also projected onto a screen in Lu’s classroom. Lu is then able to lecture and teach his class while being able to answer the questions of all of the students, even the ones raising their hands in China.
The collaborating screens at both campuses enable the students to engage in group projects, discussions and communicate with absolute synchronization.
The students from USC and PKU discuss issues facing the respective campuses and compare problem-solving techniques. Right now, they are developing a case study focused on observing and improving campus life.
Students compare differences in the problems cultures face and collaborate to find solutions.
“We’re working case studies in order to improve the respective campuses by sharing ideas and identifying problems and providing solutions,” said Craig Western, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering and a student in Lu’s class.
Many students said the class helps provide global context.
Jin Oh, a sophomore majoring in business administration and a member of Lu’s class, said the interaction of the two groups of students can help to change “the way they view the world; looking at things differently they become innovative.”
The i-Podium is still in its initial stages but it could be expanded in the future.
Kelly Goulis, associate dean of Master’s and Professional Programs at Viterbi, said the program could branch out to other schools at USC if the pilot program is successful.
“If the experience is positive and enriching for students, there soon may be multiple courses to adapt a global curriculum,” she said.
Marshall and Viterbi will evaluate the success of this spring’s class in deciding whether or not to offer the class in the fall.
Many other departments have expressed interest in the program.
If successful, i-Podium could eventually extend to other universities across the nation.

Just three years ago, Kina Grannis was a USC student secretly writing songs in campus stairwells. Today, however, the singer-songwriter and YouTube star is releasing her debut album, appropriately titled Stairwells — a coffeehouse-friendly acoustic-pop compilation that harks back to the days she spent at her alma mater.
Strong enough · Kina Grannis wrote several of the songs off her latest album, Stairwells, in actual stairwells around campus. Since graduating, the 24-year-old has maintained a fan base through her YouTube channel. - Photos courtesy of Kina Grannis 
“When I came here, music was what I really wanted to do, but at the same time I was really shy and self-conscious, so I found myself retreating to stairwells in New North, Troy Hall and VKC,” said Grannis, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in social sciences in 2007. “I just kind of sat there and wrote for hours because it was the only place I felt safe being me. I guess this album is a tribute to where I grew into an artist.”
The 24-year-old musician — who first received the attention of millions of Americans when she won the Doritos “Crash the Superbowl” contest in 2008 and currently has more than 140,000 YouTube subscribers — appeared to be much at home in McCarthy Quad for our interview.
“I’m so happy to have an excuse to come back here,” Grannis said. “I miss it.”
Grannis’ years at USC were her musical launching pad. She joined the Songwriters Club during her freshman year and was selected by the Thornton School of Music to record a CD as part of its Protégé Program, directed by Thornton’s Associate Dean of External Relations Christopher Sampson. The student-produced project developed into her first record, Sincerely, me, released in 2005.
Sampson, who became Grannis’ songwriting mentor, gave the budding artist an assignment — to wake up and write music for an hour first thing every morning.
“That’s when a ton of my writing happened,” she said.
One song on her new album, “Strong Enough,” is a product of those early morning sessions and was written during her last semester at USC.
Though she didn’t admit it to anyone at the time, Grannis confessed that music was the only thing she could imagine herself doing. So in her senior year, when she received an e-mail from a complete stranger in Austin, Texas giving her the chance to become a full-time musician after graduation, she did the unexpected and said yes.
“There was a lot of debate, but I moved to Austin … and got involved in their music community,” she said.
For six months, she sang in a now-defunct band called Doctari, raising the eyebrows of her friends and family back in California.
“The whole thing was kind of strange,” Grannis said.
Then came the Doritos “Crash the Superbowl” contest, which invited aspiring singer-songwriters to submit a song with the chance to have a music video produced and aired during the Superbowl.
Grannis submitted an original song, “Message From Your Heart,” and won. Her music video aired to 97 million Americans in a highly coveted 60-second spot after the first quarter.
“I broke down and was crying in my family’s arms for like 10 minutes,” Grannis said. “It was the most emotional thing. And at the time, I wasn’t even realizing what this meant. All I knew was that something just happened. I didn’t actually watch it at all.”
As part of the contest, Grannis also scored a record deal with Interscope Records. She then left Austin for Los Angeles and never turned back.
“It just got so crazy so quickly,” she said.
Although winning a deal with a major record label is every fledgling artist’s dream, Grannis parted ways with Interscope after just six months, finding herself at a creative crossroads with the company.
“Major labels just have so many people they need to go through before a tiny little step can get done, and it was a really slow process,” Grannis said. “At the end of the day, in my mind, the album was already written. I just wanted to record, while they still wanted to develop and have me write with other songwriters.”
Grannis decided to produce her full-length debut album independently, setting herself apart from other plucked-from-the-masses stars such as Justin Bieber and Esmée Denters who have opted to go the major label route.
“It has been a huge challenge trying to be a label by myself. Hundreds of thousands in marketing money would’ve been nice,” Grannis said. “But I had to make the album I wanted to make, have creative control and keep my YouTube, so [I don’t regret it] at all. I’m happy I did it.”
The USC alumna represents a new wave of musicians who are proving that they can make it in the music world — without the help of record companies — through media-sharing sites like YouTube and MySpace.
“The strange thing I’ve found is what people consider ‘making it.’ One way to make it is with a major label or American Idol,” Grannis said. “But I don’t think people have caught onto the fact that so many artists survive by doing it on their own.”
With the help of the Internet, her supportive family and her growing fan base, she’s proven that she can do just that.
Grannis is the 32nd most subscribed musician of all time on YouTube, a statistic that includes major artists. And some of her most popular video covers of songs by artists such as Rihanna, Taylor Swift, Michael Jackson and Jason Mraz have well over one million views.
The artist uses her online medium not only to share her acoustic covers and original songs but also to connect with fans. She frequently updates her blog and Twitter account and includes shout-outs and birthday wishes in her videos.
With each video requiring anywhere from four to eight hours to record and edit, maintaining her web presence has practically become Grannis’ full-time job.
“Sometimes I can’t believe I’ve gotten to the point where I can just do music [full time]. It’s something that I’m definitely grateful for,” Grannis said.
The singer-songwriter cites Bon Iver, Sigur Ros, Imogen Heap, K’s Choice and James Taylor as her favorite artists, and these influences come through both in her video covers and on her album.
Mostly acoustic and entirely heartfelt, Grannis’ latest album is refreshingly simple, with catchy pop hooks and soft, pleasant harmonies.
She worked with producer Rich Jacques on the record, who she met after winning the Doritos contest. Though they had initially worked together just for fun, Grannis felt Jacques truly understood where she stood as an artist. So when it came time to find a producer, she knew exactly who to ask.
“He was really good at capturing what I wanted and let me be a part of the production, which is another thing [about producing independently],” Grannis said, “Big producers will often just go and you don’t have a say in what your song will sound like. But I was there every day, playing little parts on the piano and trying to figure it all out.”
Grannis plans to tour the United States this spring and summer and hopes to eventually take her music to Europe. For now, though, she’s got a lot on her plate.
“It’s been exciting and so, so stressful,” Grannis said.
With a full-length album under her belt and a tour on the horizon, Kina Grannis has come a long way since her days at USC playing songs in stairwells, afraid to share her music with others.
But even after all this time, there’s one thing that hasn’t changed.
“There’s not many stairwells where I live now, but it’s still my favorite place to play,” Grannis said.
Thanks for writing this article ! i from france and i know she will come europe soon, i do all i can for this
What a fantastic article. As Caleb said, Kina has to be one of the most down to Earth, genuine artists around. She truly loves to connect with her fans and through everything stayed true to her craft and continues to make her music in the fashion we’ve all come to love. She probably could have “sold out” and gotten rich with Interscope, but that’s not how our Kina works.
*starts making plans on constructing a gigantic stairwell to hold a concert in*
I’d go anywhere to listen to kina’s music – I’d love to hear a concert in a stairwell some day.

I purchased her stairwells album and I cant wait to have it on repeat!! Kina is a down to earth artist that interacts with her fans! Thats what makes her stand out!
Thank you for this wonderful article. It’s really an inspiration and Kina is an inspiration. Thank you for the insight of Kina’s Journey becoming musician. I love her music all the way, from her YouTube videos. Her music is so sincere and warmfelt something I can relate with myself. 
Congrats Kina & Stairwells!
Nice to see the mystery of the album title revealed here! I love the new record. Even knowing most of the songs from youtube, I’m hooked again.
I can’t say anything the people before me have not. This is a wonderfully written article that captures how incredible Kina Grannis truly is. I too will link it everywhere I can :)
This was a fantastic article to read. I will definitely be linking a lot of people I talk to about Kina Grannis.
Thank you so much to all the folks at USC who inspired our favorite musician!

Senior gift voting is upon the class of 2010.
The students on the senior gift advisory board who brainstorm ideas for the senior gift have envisioned four ideas: a tribute to retiring USC President Steven B. Sample, a solar thermal energy system for the Lyon Center pool, a Class of 2010 Internship Award or a van for the Volunteer Center.
Each gift is unique and has its own merit. Two of the gifts offer a plaque recognizing our contribution visibly to the student body. The others do not offer something as lasting and physically visible, but instead offer much more: a lasting impression and legacy.
Every dollar the class of 2010 donates for the internship award will be matched by the USC Office of Financial Aid; senior gift organizers expect approximately $20,000 in donations. This gift will fund highly qualified students in financial need in their unpaid internships and volunteering opportunities abroad. There are very few things as life-changing as serving and volunteering abroad or working an unpaid internship to gain job experience.
I know how drastically serving in China after its catastrophic earthquake in 2008 affected me. As the class of 2010, we can provide this sort of experience for many students to come.
President Sample is a man that I look up to very much. I am grateful for all he has done for this university: raising the standard in educational quality, drawing large endowment donations and attracting high-caliber students, all to further the prestige of USC.
But while we should pay tribute to the outgoing university president, I think Sample would prefer we employ our gift to helping others or further the campus as a whole. The senior class will have an opportunity to honor Sample at a celebration later this year.
A solar thermal heating system for our pool is a neat option, but it is the most detached. I am grateful for USC’s efforts to make our campus and university-wide carbon footprint smaller. Not only is this project scheduled to take place without our senior gift, but it has  little influence on people’s lives. If our gift goes to the pool heater, it will account for at most 8 percent of the total cost of the green initiative.

Senior gift option number four is a van for the USC Volunteer Center. The Volunteer Center will use gift funding to purchase a van to take students without vehicles to volunteer opportunities in the surrounding community. Furthermore, the transportation service will bring neighboring community members to USC for on-campus programs.
This van is the only alternative to the internship award directed at influencing people and communities.
The tribute to Sample and the Lyon Center pool heater would both have much more tangible incarnations than the internship award or the van. When I initially read about the gift options, I wanted something that would flaunt “Class of 2010” somewhere on campus for everyone to see.
But as I considered the plaques of gifts from other classes in the past, I realized that I am disconnected from them; I see their plaque and appreciate their gift, yet I don’t experience any heart-felt connection to the class.
The internship award gives recognition to the class of 2010 with a named learning experience, and the van recognizes our class with the opportunity for continued community service. While these options may not have much physical recognition for the class, they do intimately connect our graduating class to those that will benefit from our contributions.
Instead of some student reading a plaque, a member of the community, student or someone in another country will have 2010 written on his heart as the class that blessed them. We will be the class that made it possible for someone to meet them and possibly serve them. We will be the class that made it possible for a student to go abroad and have a life-changing experience.
Ironically, in doing so, we will honor Sample’s legacy as well.
Let us be a class that offers our gift to the people, to the transformation of hearts and communities. Let us follow in the footsteps of President Sample and give back to the community and the students.

The current pool heating system runs off natural gas which is hardly deprecating to the environment. The thermal system is straining a gnat. There are many better and greener opportunities for Trojans to invest in, that have not been sought out by the senior gift board. All-in-all, the thermal system is hardly cost effective and does not change much environmentally.
The Solar Thermal System on the Lyon Center would be a clear values statement from the class of 2010. It would show that the seniors truly believe in creating a more sustainable world and are willing to put their money where their mouth is. I often hear people pushing for sustainability and simultaneously stating that there aren’t enough options to help make a difference. There is no guarantee that this project would happen without the contribution of the seniors. It might make financial sense for the university to invest in energy conservation measures, but I can assure you that there are many less visible projects that have a much quicker payback period than a solar thermal system. If the seniors vote for this, then they are making a clear statement that sustainability and renewable energy are important to them.

On the eve of London’s Chinese New Year celebration, Trafalgar Square stood empty. Standing at the top steps of the National Gallery, I relished this rarity, knowing full well that by noon the next day, every inch of the concrete-covered Downtown space — which is around the same size as Los Angeles’ Pershing Square — would be occupied.
I took the bus early the next afternoon, only to be diverted by routes altered for the day’s festivities. Stranded by public transportation and a haywire sense of direction, I looked like a USC freshman trying to find the Coliseum for the first time and decided to just to just follow the crowd.
But it wasn’t the sound of firecrackers or the Caucasian man dressed in traditional Chinese garb that alerted me of my proximity to the event. From about a quarter of a mile away, I could hear string instrumentals and high-pitched Beijing opera music blasting from the stage.
As soon as I stepped foot on the firecracker shell-strewn pavement of Trafalgar Square, I took a good look at the crowd that enveloped me and was surprised by the turnout, a large portion of which was actually Chinese.
Vendors at promotional booths hawking gift bags that included soy sauce, Chinese-inspired aprons and New Year’s-themed DVDs grabbed the attention of potential customers with special deals.
And true to British drinking culture, a public bar selling Tsingtao beer, a specialty from the Shandong province of China, was set up on the side.
More than 250,000 people arrived the Sunday after the first day of the Chinese New Year to welcome the Year of the Tiger and participate in the most important holiday in Chinese culture. Many attendees flaunted their spirits by buying tiger tails, paper dragons and other celebratory trinkets.
The date of Chinese New Year changes annually in accordance with the first day of the lunar calendar. The celebration lasts for 15 days and consists of cultural traditions for each day, including visiting relatives, setting off firecrackers and, of course, eating good food.
When the emcee came on stage to galvanize the crowd into doing the “Chinese wave,” which appeared startlingly similar to “the wave” performed at sports events, she cited her pride in being British-Chinese.
Britain has one of the largest Chinese communities in Europe, with a large portion of that population residing in London.
The effect of that presence is a robust Chinatown that attracts tourists and locals alike with restaurants, markets and other Chinese-run businesses housed in architecturally traditional buildings.
Organized by the London Chinatown Chinese Association, the massive celebration kicked off with a parade through central London and ended in Chinatown, which was decorated with red and gold lanterns and good-fortune posters to mark the occasion.
Dancers wearing colorful dragon-like costumes mimicked a lion’s movements to the beat of drums, cymbals and gongs, as they attempted to ward off bad spirits and spread prosperity by scattering leaves of lettuce.
By mid-afternoon, the narrow streets of Shaftesbury Avenue in Chinatown were packed with people trying to get a peek at the lion dancers as they tried to eat lettuce hung off of fishing poles outside local businesses.
In exchange for this service, businesses also attached red envelopes with money onto the fishing lines to bestow prosperity in more literal terms.
Chinese custom also dictates the offering of red envelopes — called ya sui qian — and is normally given by married adults to younger children “to crush the spirits,” as the translation of the tradition’s name indicates.
Little did I realize that, by the time the lion dance had finished, the crowd had slowly pushed my friends and me in front of a Chinese bakery selling egg tarts. For 2 pounds ($3.05) apiece, we greedily devoured the flaky pastry crust filled with egg custard, which left us only wanting more.
With our hunger sparked, we popped into Fung Shing Restaurant to order a real Chinese meal.
The food available, however, didn’t include the traditional specialties, such as dumplings and nian gao (or New Year’s Cake), eaten during New Year’s celebrations. But, Fung Shing did have an array of family-style dishes in the communal eating style typical of Chinese culture
At about 5:45 p.m., we followed the masses once again toward Leicester Square for the closing ceremony that promised fireworks. After a lengthy speech, the entire square fell silent in anticipation for the first explosion.
Flashes of red and gold glittered the sky in every direction. With the fireworks shot so low into the sky, I could almost touch the tails of light as they rained down dangerously close to the trees. A line of lanterns was lit to look like rockets ready for launch. Firecrackers popped on the ground nearby, matching in loudness the brightness of their more powerful counterparts.
It was as if the world had stopped for 15 minutes as the crowd watched in hushed awe. When the display ended, the crowd disbanded, and I left with my stomach full and Trafalgar and Leicester Squares as empty as they were the night before.

Palin, Kardashian, Jersey Shore cast booked for Leno’s homecoming
Jay Leno’s much anticipated return to The Tonight Show will include quite a variety of guests and performers. The homecoming is attracting a large amount of interest among viewers and will garner an A-list line-up of guests.
Tonight, his first night back in the 11:30 timeslot, Leno sits down with Jamie Foxx and Olympic Gold Medal Skier Lindsey Vonn, plus a musical performance by Brad Paisley. The two-week line-up, released by NBC last week, includes other A-listers like Sarah Palin, Olympic Star Snowboarder Shaun White, Chelsea Handler and Matthew McConaughey, as well as the cast from MTV’s Jersey Shore (who is also scheduled to make an appearance on The View later this month). A performance by controversial live TV performer Adam Lambert is still in the works for Tuesday night.
Leno is returning to The Tonight Show after an unsuccessful shift to a prime time talk show. He is reclaiming the show from Conan O’Brien who left when NBC tried to move him back to his original midnight timeslot. The New York Times reported that O’Brien received a $45 million settlement from NBC to get him out of his contract earlier this year.
Precious wins big at 41st Image Awards
If you noticed tons of limos and people in black-tie attire on campus Friday, they weren’t coming to USC. They were headed across Jefferson Street to the Shine Auditorium for the 41st Annual NAACP Awards.
I did attend both the VIP Pre-Reception on Thursday evening at Milk Studio in Hollywood and the awards show on Friday broadcast live on FOX.  The reception, which was an intimate relaxed evening for the celebrities and guests to mingle, featured stars including Sherri Shepherd, Idris Elba, Donnie McClurkin, Denise Boutter, Keith Robinson, Eva Marcell with new beau Lance Gross and LaLa Vasquez. I spotted The View’s Sherri Shepherd and her husband along with Tracie Ellis Ross, from hit sitcom Girlfriends, having a great time dancing to Beyonce’s Single Ladies with partygoers in the studio-turned dancefloor.
At the award show the next night, Precious won six Image Awards including best picture, director, screenplay, lead and supporting actress. The film is competing in all those categories at next week’s Oscars. I did get to talk to Xosha Roquemore about her role in Precious alongside Gabourey Sidibe. Roquemore played Sidibe’s classmate, Joann (who’s favorite color was fluorescent beige).
“It was great being on set with Gabby during taping,” said Roquemore. “That’s my homegirl and I know she’s going to do her thing at the Oscars next week!”
The show consisted of appearances and presentations by many black celebritie elites including Tyler Perry, who accepted the Chairman’s award, Monique’, Chris Rock, Maxwell, Nick Cannon, Gabrielle Union, Tichina Arnold. Cicely Tyson and Morgan Freedman. John Legend, Kerri Hilson, Mary-Mary and Tamela Mann performed during the event.
Sandra Bullock also attended the event for her best actress nomination for her role in The Blind Side. She received many positive comments on her dress during the evening, even one on stage from host Anika Noni Rose joking, “Sandra Bullock, your dress is bad, girl!”
USC student Devan Bratton, who works for SeatFillers.com, got to sit next to Bullock for almost half the show on the front row. Many students watching the broadcast noticed Bratton on TV sitting right next to Bullock during the show. “She was very nice to me and talked to me a lot during the show,” said Bratton.
Osmond son commits suicide, leaves note for friend
Marie Osmond’s son died here in Los Angeles Friday night after jumping from his eighth floor apartment. In a note he left for “his only close friend in Los Angeles,” he said he intended to commit suicide after a life-long battle with depression. Osmond pulled out of her performance with her brother Donny at the Flamingo in Las Vegas on Saturday night after hearing the devastating news.
Michael Blosili, 18, was a student at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, the school on the LA season of Project Runway and The Hills. Blosili had been battling depression for many years. In 2007, at age 16, he went to rehab for undisclosed reasons. His mom, Marie, was hospitalized in 2006 for an alleged attempted suicide. She quickly denied the claim after the National Enquirer published the story.
He, along with other members of the Osmond family, was seen publicly on the Osmond special on The Oprah Show last year. TMZ.com reported that The Los Angeles Police Department has launched an investigation into Blosili’s death and an autopsy has been scheduled.
Ne-Yo arrested? In Norway?
I never thought I would hear of R&B singer Ne-Yo coming within 50 feet of men fighting with guns and knives. Contrary to my belief, that’s what happened this weekend in Norway with Ne-Yo and his crew.
After a show in Oslo, Norway, Ne-Yo and his ‘boys’ attended an after party where they were drinking and dancing in a club’s VIP section. The club’s security was called to the scene because of a massive fight that broke out close to their private section. YBF.com is reporting that Ne-Yo and his crew were allegedly throwing fists and kicks. A Norwegian newspaper published that one of Ne-Yo’s crewmembers punched someone in the face and “blood was everywhere.”
When the fight broke up, the singer and his crew tried to leave the club, but another fight broke out in the street. The police detained Ne-Yo and a few a members of his crew outside as they tried to leave the second fight. Reports do not specify whether Ne-Yo was officially arrested or just detained.

On Wednesday evening, the Marshall School of Business’ Society and Business Lab, in conjunction with the School of Cinematic Arts and the Coalition to Abolish Slavery & Trafficking screened Kavi, a Oscar-nominated short film about a young modern-day slave laborer working in a brick kiln in India. Through its heartfelt depictions, the film sheds important light on the country and its social problems. More importantly, Kavi makes it starkly known that slavery still exists everywhere in the world today. In fact, the current number of slaves number is approximately 27 million, more slaves than history has ever known.
Definitively, slavery can be described as the restriction of ones freedom to move, which includes much more than the slavery written in history books. For one, such a restriction consists of human trafficking and, in a way, the millions of people who leave their countries to find work out of necessity, based on oppressive economic factors.
Many Southeast Asian businesses depend on these kinds of employees, migrant workers who provide inexpensive labor, to keep their countries competitive with rising giants China and India. On the other end, the system allows workers to find productive employment in host countries.
On Tuesday, the Thai Labor Ministry enacted a new immigration policy aimed at better monitoring its labor force. Unregistered foreign migrant workers had to either seek new work permits or request to have their citizenship validated, disrupting the country’s heavy reliance on migrant workers. The policy was leveraged with the threat of arrest and deportation for those who didn’t comply.
According to the International Migrants Alliance (IMA), there are more than 1.4 million migrant workers in Thailand, mostly originating from the Southeast Asian countries of Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. They constitute about 5 to 10 percent of the Thai work force. With that said, a reported 500,000 people did not register with local authorities and are now facing deportation.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Though the Thai government’s concerns of preserving national labor laws and keeping health and security risks at bay are legitimate, this abrasive register-or-leave policy may not be the most effective method. For one, the system apparently does not translate instructions into the workers’ native languages, making it daunting and very difficult to register.
Businesses are frantic that this will drive costs up and hurt Thailand’s economy. Low-wage businesses, predominantly textile mills and farms, have already been experiencing employment shortages and cannot afford to lose a significant portion of their workers. Deporting thousands of foreign workers may mean that wages will have to increase. For many migrant workers, like those from Myanmar, returning to their home countries might not be a safe option. Furthermore, as activists at Human Rights Watch purport, there is a lack of transparency in the country and region as a whole.
“Physical abuse, maltreatment and subhuman conditions are but a few of the bad things to come to migrant workers who will be arrested and detained once the Thai government pursues its crackdown,“ said Eni Lestari, chairperson of the IMA.
Another point of contention is the Thai government’s recent signing of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Declaration on the Protection and Promotion of the Rights of Migrant Workers, which this new policy could violate. For “humanitarian” purposes, it says, “the receiving states and the sending states shall take into account the fundamental rights and dignity of migrant workers and family members already residing with them without undermining the application by the receiving states of their laws, regulations and policies.” But what if there were a problem with the laws, regulations and policies of the state?
A classic case of overlapping authority and clashing priorities, Thailand’s immigration policy has resulted in different influential parties arguing in opposite directions. For the authorities, it seems to be an issue of an “us vs. them” ideology, where the government is concerned with preserving national boundaries and the domestic workforce, as any sovereign state is naturally apt to do. But the consequences of this recent policy will affect both migrant and domestic workers, the costs of production and, potentially, interstate relations.
Before creating such a stringent punishment, the groundwork for proper follow through needs to be set. If not, the purpose is defeated. It seems as though the laborers are left between a rock and a hard place and, as Wednesday’s discussion pointed out, there are millions similarly trapped in this situation.
Nadine Tan is a sophomore majoring in business administration. Her column, “World Rapport” runs Fridays.
Wow, just Wow. An opening paragraph about SLAVERY and then you lead in to a discussion of Thai immigration law (which is, let’s face it, a thinly-veiled discussion of OUR immigration law). The main point you seem to have is that Thailand’s insistence that immigrants have proper visas and obey the law is… inhumane? Racist maybe? The suggestion that immigrant laborers will face “physical abuse, maltreatment and subhuman conditions” if they register with the authorities is shameless. What do you think happens to them now, when they have no recourse to law enforcement, and live at the mercy of whatever unethical bosses will illegally employ them?
In Orwell’s 1984, Oceania’s fictional slogan was “war is peace; freedom is slavery; ignorance is strength”… you haven’t written anything about war and peace in this article, but two out of three isn’t bad, I guess.

USC boasts the largest international student population of any university in the country and is located in one of the nation’s most diverse cities  — on Friday, those two worlds came together.
Students from a wide array of countries, including Thailand, China, Australia, Taiwan, Denmark, India, Columbia, Iran and Papua New Guinea, visited Vermont Avenue Elementary School as part of the school’s Literacy Day. Now in its third year, Literacy Day is a chance for elementary school students to interact with people from different countries and cultures, and a chance for USC students to tell children the importance of reading and going to college.

Topics ranging from after school activities to what species of animals live in each country filled each classroom Friday morning as USC students detailed their experiences growing up in other countries.
Leidy Lim, a graduate student studying teaching English to speakers of other languages, said it was fun to watch the children’s reactions as the USC students talked about their cultures.
“They ask so many questions,” Lim said. “The kids are so curious about how life in their country differs from mine. I told them Papua New Guinea doesn’t have theaters, and they were in absolute shock.”
To the kids, the experience is a fun way to learn about a lifestyle outside the United States. But many of the USC student volunteers said they might have learned just as much as the children did.
“It’s a great opportunity not for just the kids, but for us as well to give back to the society,” said Warren Chan, a senior majoring in business administration. “It’s mutually beneficial, and I find it very uplifting.”
Prior to this year, Literacy Day had previously been held at Loren Miller Elementary School. But Brenda Cortez, who is now the principal at Vermont Avenue, heard about USC’s Office of International Students and the International Students’ Assembly and worked with the groups to bring the event to Vermont Avenue.
Though this is the only outreach program specifically involving international students, OIS and ISA are looking to have a few more days like this at the elementary school. A culture day might be in the works for the future, with students from ISA spending a whole day focusing on teaching kids about traditional food, clothing and societal customs.
Many of USC’s international students, including Xiaoran Wang, a graduate student studying electrical engineering, said they hope the program will be expanded.
“The children just get so excited to see us, and it really makes me happy and makes me think to myself how I could get more involved,” Wang said.
Becky Peterson, international student adviser at OIS, said she sees a great desire among international students to participate in these outreach programs, and she hopes more events of this type will develop.
“The international kids have such huge hearts. To do something like this really showcases how much they really enjoy giving back,” Peterson said.

USC School of Architecture dean QingYun Ma recently appeared on BusinessWeek‘s list of the world’s “27 Most Influential Movers and Shakers,” which “aims to shine a light on the breadth and scope of the profession as well as to highlight those whose work is influencing global business and policy.”
Ma is one of three renowned architects on the list to have won the prestigious Pritzker Prize and appears alongside past winners Zaha Hadid and Rem Koolhaas.  Other influential designers recognized by BusinessWeek include Apple design guru Johnathan Ive, spaceplane designer Burt Rutan and the New York’s Museum of Modern Art senior curator of architecture and design Paola Antonelli
Ma taught architecture at Harvard University, Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania before coming to USC in 2007.
In 2008, Ma launched the USC American Academy in China, which aims to become China’s leading platform for critical research in the arts, architecture, urbanism and humanities. That year, he worked as a planning expert for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
In 1999, Ma formed the internationally-recognized architecture firm MADA s.p.a.m., whose work has been exhibited in Paris, Venice and Berlin. MADA s.p.a.m. is responsible for Qingpu Community Island in Shangai, the Centennial TV and Radio Center in Xi’an, and Tianyi City Plaza in Ningbo. MADA s.p.a.m. is considered the most internationally visible practice in China.

Regarding Dr. Finkelstein
The news article published March 11 in the Daily Trojan under the title, “USG-funded speaker event draws criticism,” was a misleading piece of journalism rife with bias against USG-funded guest speaker Dr. Norman Finkelstein, whom Students for Justice in Palestine hosted for a speech that night.
The topic of Finkelstein’s lecture was the Israeli invasion of the Gaza strip last year, and he focused on discussing and affirming the findings of the subsequent investigations by the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that found evidence of pervasive and systematic crimes against humanity by Israeli soldiers in what Finkelstein deems a “massacre.”
However, the article published by the Daily Trojan showed no indication of this. Instead, it published outrageous claims that Dr. Finkelstein is “said to be a Holocaust-denier” and asserted through a student’s quote that Dr. Finkelstein is supportive of killing any Israeli civilian.
Dr. Finkelstein’s entire family went through the Nazi Holocaust, and he has never denied that it occurred. While it is true that he is “said to be Holocaust denier” by a select, radical few that wish to defame him, this statement is patently false, and for the Daily Trojan to publish such a disgusting allegation is poor journalism. Holocaust denial is not subjective — Dr. Norman Finkelstein is not a Holocaust-denier, and for ’SC Students for Israel and College Republicans to blatantly lie about a man who lost so much of his family in the Holocaust is morally repugnant.
Additionally, Shanel Melamed’s comment that Dr. Finkelstein “say[s] that it’s OK for me to be killed” is blatantly untrue and a very obvious attempt to defame a man who has never made any comment in the past that he is somehow “OK” with just killing innocent Israeli civilians, as the quote suggests. To publish such an outrageous and false assertion by a student as if it had any basis in reality is in truly poor taste.
We are also rather shocked at the complete lack of even a semblance of neutrality. Marwa Katbi, SJP’s Vice President, was asked by the Daily Trojan reporter what she thought of the claims that Finkelstein is anti-Semitic and expressed that Finkelstein does not hold anti-Semitic views, adding that any insinuation otherwise is a bogus claim. She continued to say that slamming Finkelstein with a baseless charge of anti-Semitism was an attempt to silence his honest criticism of Israel, and a drew away from the main issue of Thursday night’s lecture, which she stated was the massive human rights abuses committed by the state of Israel.
Running this quote alongside the opposing claims would have been the proper way to balance a news article about our event. To be in the possession of such a quote and not to have printed it strikes us at best as convenient censorship and at worst as willful propaganda.
We hope the Daily Trojan will in the future reconsider publishing statements like those above that serve to defame USG-funded speakers, and our club, with baseless accusations.
USC Students for Justice in Palestine
I’m wondering why people are so quick to label Dr. Finkelstein as a fraud (multiple times in the comments), or hateful person without offering any validation.  I’m certainly open to that argument, but there’s nothing that I’ve seen that indicates that he actually is a fraud.  Does he speak untruthfully, cite lies, misquote, or present inaccurate realities?  Or is it that he just makes conclusions that make us uncomfortable, that we don’t agree with, or that we have a hard time believing because they are scary?  From what I’ve seen of the guy, he doesn’t make up histories or deny that they occurred, and he cites his sources.  So, if we’re labeling him anything other than Doctor (he received his doctorate from Princeton University’s Department of Politics), please, let’s see some real reasons why, or its just more malicious slander.
anyone catch Martin Sherman’s lecture on Islam and Israel on Thursday? It was the biggest load of unacademic crap and blatant islamophobia i’ve seen usc pay for in a while.
the usc college republicans and students for israel are from the same lying, immoral group as that sleazebag. props to SJP for fighting this
Ahh shut your mouth.  Anyone who doesnt support your position is automatically crap.  Learn to respect other peoples positions, especially when they are right.   Until you recognize that there are terrible things done in the name of Islam and condemn it for what it is, youre going to be on the fringe.  May Israel defend itself now and forever, from an Indian friend who has seen the same types of attacks in his country!
hahaha
i do respect other peoples’ opinions, and condemn terrorism- IN ALL ITS FORMS, including STATE SPONSORED TERRORISM. For me, this is the real danger, as it is uncotnrolled and backed up armies and lots of cash. the US Invasion of Iraq, and the subsequent 100,000s of innocent Iraqi deaths, is terrorism.
i like how you say “shut your mouth,” while telling me to respect other opinions.
ISLAMOPHOBIA and racism are different from legitimate criticism of policy.
My original post condemned the newspaper and the students it quoted for being completely wrong and thus maliciously attacking the integrity of a man and the organization that sponsored him.  As I said, that is slander, plain and simple.  Those students and the newspaper should be held accountable.  So thank you SJP for defending your voice with this letter to the editor.
Since then some other people here have turned this into a snowballing argument about the Middle East issue.  I have already bitten on your provocation, and I won’t do it again.  It didn’t take long for me to be inaccurately labeled as an Anti-Semite–that token term that gets handed out like Halloween candy to anyone who questions Israel’s illegal actions and racist policies.  Send me the proverbial friend request if you want to talk about Palestine-Israel, but that’s not what I was talking about here originally.
haha yes youre so right! When people attack you and blow themselves up in your cities, just chill.  It will go away somehow. There arent really people who want to kill you for religious or territorial reasons.  
Rolling my eyes
Norman Finklestein=destructive, dishonest, scummy little human being parading under the banner of academia=complete nonsense
Please stop and take a look at this debate. None of us believes human rights violations, including killing of anyone, is ok. Could we respectfully consider the notion that each of us believes in the same principles and is working towards the same goal of peace? Anyone thoughtfully considering fact as objectively as possible (such as Dr. Finklestein) should be given our respect at the very least, regardless of his followers, or his opponents.
It would be nice to think that, wouldn’t it? Unfortunately, there are bad people in the world, and it is necessary for good people to defeat them — on the battleground of ideas if possible, on the battleground of battle otherwise. Thankfully, Israel has shown the resolve to defend itself in both arenas.
How narrow-minded is your world view? If you are so naive to think that this is a battle of good versus evil, I am genuinely appalled that you are going to graduate with a degree from any university. Please take yourself out of the TV-world that you live in, learn a little about putting yourself in another person’s shoes, and then join the debate to contribute something meaningful.
Do you deny the existence of evil? If your whole philosophy is based on the principle that every person, every ideology, every act is morally equivalent, then you have some hard growing-up left to do. People who would strap bombs onto their own children for the sake of murdering innocents are not morally equivalent to soldiers who would risk their lives to protect their children. Activists working to undermine Israel’s right to self-defense are not “equally right” to those who support that right. And no, it doesn’t matter if they have “good intentions”. Wrong is not right. Words have meanings. Terrorists are not freedom fighters. Certainly evil people can have their minds changed (see “battleground of ideas” above), but we’re all safer when the good guys have more and better guns.
Okay so IDF soldiers who shoot unarmed palestinians are morally justified. Glad I have heard your point of view.
No jack thats not what he’s saying.  That is obviously a horrible tragedy and if the incident was as you say than those soldiers are obviously not morally justified.  But when you say phrases like “IDF soldiers who shoot unarmed palestinians” , those kinds of accusations are often grossly wrong.  So many times you hear that Palestinians are killed, but the real story is not told.  Were they in the crossfires when the IDF was attacked? Were they being used as human shields?  Were the unarmed civilians among people who were attacking Israeli forces?
I remember reading a report once that said 25 Palestinians had died in an explosion late at night, and Hamas and others accused Israel of bombing civilian homes.  Turns out the incident was that a device went off in a bomb manufacturing factory in gaza and the 25 people there or around it were killed when munitions exploded.  
Way too often Israel is blamed when Palestinian civilians are killed and it is actually the fault of the terrorists who use palestinians to their advantage
I think what he means is that people who declare that they want to destroy Israel and act towards that goal without any regard for human life even on their own side can be considered evil.  And its really not necessary to insult someone for being in college if you dont agree with their views… haha
“That is obviously a horrible tragedy and if the incident was as you say than those soldiers are obviously not morally justified”
Well… now take that logic… and apply it… to other examples… which there are a myriad of…
“So many times you hear that Palestinians are killed, but the real story is not told. Were they in the crossfires when the IDF was attacked? Were they being used as human shields? Were the unarmed civilians among people who were attacking Israeli forces?”
Very clear reason why the “real story” is never told. Operation Cast Lead is an outstanding example. Israel invades Gaza but bans reporters. They refuse to do a decent internal investigation after international groups all have substantial reports of numerous human rights violations. They didn’t let reporters in because of what happened during the Second Lebanon War when their atrocities were reported numerous times.
This is all very easy to read up and discover. Your excuse sounds like some generic CNN comment.
I wonder how many of those here lambasting Dr. Finkelstein and his supporters actually attended his presentation.  If they had they would have been given the first opportunity to challenge him on any of his statements; either from the evening’s lecture or elsewhere. Sitting in the audience a few rows behind me were Israel supporters who (I’m speculating) took issue with some of Dr. Finkelstein’s positions. They wore name badges with “TRUTH” written on them. They walked out in unison at the end of Dr. Finkelstein’s talk (save one or two). Of this group, only one student asked questions (to the best of my recollection). He went first and was allowed multiple questions of which Dr. Finkelstein addressed each and every point (he also praised the student for taking an opposing view in front of an audience largely sympathetic to Dr. Finkelstein’s views). Dr. Finkelstein then suggested that some of the other people waiting have an opportunity and that he would return to the student for further questions at the end if he wished (which he declined when the time came).
Sadly, what I see here is a rehash of so many of the same discredited arguments (if not outright personal attacks). All would have had the chance to directly face the object of their ire and challenge him on any point of fact they chose. This is the third time I’ve seen Dr. Finkelstein speak to a university audience and he is remarkably consistent. Detractors are given the courtesy to go first in line for questions, and he does not shy away from any of them, or the statements or presumptions included with the questions. 
From my perspective, the frustration apparent is the inability to counter his points, rather than the claim he is putting forth a false representation.
I have seen Finklestein speak before, and have read many of his books. Its very naive to think that those who criticize him don’t know what they’re talking about or haven’t done their homework. I am very well educated on the matter.
And it is too bad that this same courtesy is not shown by many who support Finklestein and his ideas toward people on the other side of the issue.  For example, just recently the Israeli Ambassador to the United States was at UC Irvine giving a speech but was not able to finish because Palestinian supporting students in the audeince repeatedly stood up and started yelling free palestine nonsense until people gave up.  This has not been a rare occurence on campuses throughout the US, but I have no heard of a time when supporters of Israel interrupted a speaker so many times that he was forced to give up, much less an ambassador to the US.
I’ve seen him speak before.  The guys a delussional idiot
I don’t know how else you qualify shooting 4 teenagers in one weekend.
Jack, you are my hero. The end.
Wait what event are you referring to?
israel killed 4 palestinian protestors last weekend. so much for free speech.
And rockets have again been flying into Israel recently, killing civilians, and several Israeli soldiers have been killed in the past couple weeks as well. 
If you are going to report the news, report all of it, not the segments that you want to use to support your cause.  Thank you
I dont know about this specific incident, but the real difference is that one side (namely Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist groups) has the expressed attempt to kill the other side no matter if it is a soldier or a man, woman, or child, and on the other side Israel does everything it can to avoid civilian casualties.  If Israel had dropped its weapons at any time in the past 60 years, it would have been attacked and destroyed. If terrorist groups around Israel had dropped their weapons, there would have been peace.  We cant keep justifying terrorist groups who advocate terror by saying its because of the other side or their circumstances…they are in those circumstances because of their actions and outside forces wanting to harm Israel more than establish peace.
Oh my god you people are awful. The article you complain about only said that Finkeldink was “said to be” a Holocaust denier. In the same text, it accused Israel of racism and murder, without and qualification like “said to be”. Do you interpret anything less than a call for a new Holocaust to be “pro-Israel bias”? Clearly the DT is biased in favor of your anti-semitic views… if not, why would they print your Letter which is just a rehashing of what you wrote in the comments on the earlier thread? Accusing them of a pro-Israel bias (heaven forbid such a thing!) is clearly dishonest and disingenuous on your part.
Right, Joe.  It is said that Finkelstein is a holocaust denier, which is a statement that is wrong. Finkelstein is on record speaking very clearly about his own family’s persecution during the Holocaust. The Daily Trojan failed to point that out, and thus it legitimized a lie. Sure, the editors posted the correction to the article online, but since it was the crux of argument opposing his campus appearance, the Daily Trojan should have checked if those claims were legitimate in order to ask whether or not to write the article in the first place.  Otherwise it’s no better than tabloid fodder.
You are also right that the article stated that he accuses Israel of racist policies, which is something I think he would not dispute, but I can’t say for sure.  So, to the best of my knowledge, this is accurate reporting.
The paper published slanderous statements that deliberately attacked another’s character, and that is very serious. People can go to court for that type of offense. Once is enough, but the author solidified the sentiment repeatedly by quoting Lauren Korbatov who equated Finkelstein to a person who denies slavery ever occurred, and Melamed at the end of the article, who feared that he intended to hurt her for some reason.  Each time the article failed to point out that these students’ accusations were false in the most basic sense of the word.
Lastly, HOW DARE you accuse me of harboring anti-Semitic views, as that was no part of my statement. DO NOT accuse me of anti-Semitism. If you intend to accuse me of hating Jewish people, I do not.  Furthermore, I am part Arab–A descendent of a people from the Near East called Semites. I do not hate myself.
Umm in case you didn’t realize, the term anti-Semite doesn’t carry the literal meaning of semite anymore…..its definition deals specifically bigotry and hatred against Jews.  
As for everything else, I just don’t understand why you are so concerned with defending this man Finklestein…I’m very curious how passionately you would defend someone who does not support your position of the Israeli-Palestinian issue.  Indeed, I am very curious.  
And although the writers of the article may not have completely accurately described Finklestein when it called him a “Holocaust denier”, he defenitely deserves much blame and condemnation for minimalizing the Holocaust and pretending that it was somehow exagerated for political purposes.  For example, he once posed how it was possible that so many people died in the Holocaust if there are so many survivors…..  That’s like asking how it was possible that thousands of people died when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima if there are so many people with radiation poisoning from it…  
No matter his familiar ties to the Holocaust, the man has done great injustices to the issue and insulted those who lived through it by pretending like it was an exagerated account made up for political purposes instead of the greatest instance of human cruelty in the history of mankind.
Again, I am extremely curious how you would defend this man or others like him from “misinformation” if he did stand on the same side as your views and opinions.  I look forward to seeing your outraged and passionate comments on future articles in which pro-Israel figures are misportrayed by the media.
I disagree with the inaccurate usage of the term anti-Semitism, but that is irrelevant. If it refers to a hatred or bigotry targeted against Jews specifically I am still appalled to have been labeled as such, because it is simply, AGAIN, not true (I’m sensing a theme here).
To everything else…
I would hope that ANY article published by the Daily Trojan contains statements that are factually based. And I would not advocate for the misrepresentation of anyone on the other side of the issue, or do so myself. I don’t see why you would even question that. This isn’t about me defending Finkelstein. I disagree with the manner in which this man was represented by the Daily Trojan and the students who spoke out against him because it was entirely inaccurate. That is all I mean.  I’m steamed about this because using deliberate misinformation and scare tactics are the greatest disservice to this or any political debate. I think you would agree. So, yes, I am passionate about this. And no, I don’t feel that my stance on the issue (though it’s clear) matters in the context of my arguments.
Whatever the article concluded about Dr. Finkelstein should have been factual. If he has stated that the memory of the Holocaust has been exploited for political gain, then that is a theory that is the right of an educated political scientist to make.  That is what political scientists do. His theory should be presented as such, whether or not any of us think it is reasonable. It should not be twisted into an inaccurate representation of his views. The Daily Trojan and the students the article quoted have done that. He is not a Holocaust denier as the article mentioned, nor has he expressed even the shadow of intention to physically harm any student at this university.  Theorizing about the manner in which the Nazi Holocaust has shaped world politics is not the same as denying it ever occurred.
I’m done.
haha your statement “theorizing about the manner in which the Nazi Holocaust has shaped world politics is not the same as denying it ever occured” must be a euphemism for “theorizing that the Holocaust really wasnt so bad and was totally exagerated so that it could be used for selfish reasons is fine cuz its not as crazy as denying it outright”
I am now going to go theorize that slavery really wasn’t so bad as people think and African Americans have disgracefuly exagerated it and used it for political purposes.    
No one is saying that Finklestein doesn’t have the right to make his absurd claims but that doesnt mean we cant refute and condemn his dishonesty.
Rami, anti-semitism doesn’t mean “hate” in your heart, it means bigotry in the world. I don’t give a rat’s you-know-what whether you:
(a) hate the Jews
(b) are enamored of a handsome liberal professor who hates the Jews
(c) believe that murdering Jews will get you into heaven
(c) have convinced yourselves that you’re unbiased, but the Jews happen to be evil
(d) are trying to impress a hippie chick
(e) don’t know the facts, and are parroting something you heard a celebrity say
All I need to know to call you an anti-semite is that you are intently, actively, working to spread lies (“racism”, “murder”) about Israel, spread hatred of the Jewish people, trying to undermine Israel’s right to exist and to defend itself, and using lies to defend another anti-semite. You are working for anti-semitic ends. You don’t get “points” for having good intentions.
Its no surprise to me that the Daily Trojan would print an article full of lies regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and specially the people which speak on behalf of the Palestinian people. As a former SJP member from 2004 to 2008 I have found many such biased articles printed by the staff of the Daily Trojan and time and again we have had to write letters back expressing our outrage.  
Its time the staff and editors start doing their part in writing balanced and well researched pieces that reflect the real situation in the middle east as is being done by reputable organizations like the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. 
This is not only a problem that affects the USC campus, but also on a national scale.  The lack of news sources that will speak the truth regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is staggering and this problem greatly contributes to the fact that human rights abuses in Gaza and other territories continue to go unnoticed! 
Stop selling propaganda to USC students! Its no wonder that alternative news sources to the Daily Trojan have been printed in past years. There has historically been a lack of balanced writing coming from the Daily Trojan and thats just plain bad journalism!
Thank you for following up, SJP.  This lack of diligent, dutiful reporting and disregard for the most basic tenets of journalism has been a noticeable theme in articles published by the Daily Trojan.  I’m not accusing the entire organization.  I know you try, and I know you’re students.  But these are more than simple misgivings I have.  The article quoted students making slanderous and biased quotations that attacked Finkelstein’s philosophies and previous statements.  As SJP has stated here, these accusations were just plain false. This is far more serious than an error in the sports section on the back page.  This is especially true when dealing with the highly contentious Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where misinformation abounds.
It is despicable to publish accusations about “what is said” of a person, while ignoring or giving no allusion to what that person actually says.  Shouldn’t someone check to see if ‘what is said’ of a person is actually true?  Failure to do so makes you no more credible than the ridiculous tabloids I scoff at every time I check out at the grocery store.  For a student reporter and editor trying to build credibility, the Finkelstein article from March 10 was a serious blow to that goal.  As much as I’d like to accuse the Daily Trojan of deliberately spinning this article, I will refrain, and hope that as students you learn about the repercussions poor reporting.
Fighting misinformation is the utmost tenet of your aspired profession.  LIVE BY IT. Truthful, even-handed reporting is the most basic of your ethical responsibilities as journalists, and the article published on March 10 about Mr. Finkelstein showed a clear disregard for that.
Ok Rami who is so concerned with truth.
TRUTH-  the only reason SJP is defending the fraud Finklestein is because he supports their anti-Israel sentiment. Its got nothing to do with honest reporting or character defamation.  It’s the same old Israel-hating nonsense. 
You really think otherwise?  Give up the act.
Great letter! Hopefully the DT will learn from it’s atrocious mistake with that article and actually start reporting and doing researching. The fact that Finkelstein’s parents survived the Holocaust is even listed on his Wikipedia…it is not exactly difficult to figure out that those allegations about him were just plain false.
Yes! Let us always support anti-Israel speakers for political purposes!!!  The fact that he had family in the Holocaust makes it fine for him to say whatever he wants!!!!
Give me a break…..
What’s wrong with supporting anti-Israel speakers for political purposes? Seems fine to me. In the US we question Cuba’s policies, Venezuela’s, and China’s policies. I don’t see a difference in Dr. Finkelstein’s right to do that to Israel?
Here’s why….because it is part of a larger attack on Israel that is characterized by a DOUBLE STANDARD and DISPROPORTIONATE condemnation and attack of Israel. 
Think of all the academics and “intellectuals” like Finklestein who attack Israel relentlessly.  Think about the wider international community (particularly in the UN) where Israel is condemned and condemned in the harshest manner a thousand times before a countries like China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Sudan, whose human rights abuses rage a thousand times greater than anything Israel has ever come close to doing, are even given a slap on the wrist or asked to politely stop. 
Btw equating those countries you mentioned with Israel is an extremely unfair assesment.  You named three countries that range from dictatorial to repressive to closed socities and more… in contrast to the open society and only democracy in the entire middle east (this does not mean it has no problems or faults of its own).  
And even if people were to buy the claim that questioning policies of repressive regimes is somehow on the same level as criticizing israel, where on college campuses do we see constant attacking of any of these countries like we do with Israel?  This charade is getting really old….
Just because something is disproportionately portrayed does not mean that it makes their actions any more right or justified. 
I don’t know what media you see, but I think the clash is coming from how one-sided this debate is shown on our news system and how ignorant that makes our general population. Everyone has a sense about the terrible things happening in Sudan and China and why they are occurring. Having speakers “speak out” against the atrocities in Sudan seems redundant when (mostly) everyone knows about it and generally are against it. Instead, we have informational booths, bake sales, and movie screenings to raise awareness that everyone is happy to support and attend.
Not everyone knows about the Israel-Palestine conflict’s causes or how the US taxpayer is funding it. I would say Americans have a bigger hand in that cookie jar, giving us a larger responsibility for continuing that conflict when the majority of us do not know about it. Therefore, college campuses in America would naturally have more speakers about political events that are happening on our dime in order to educate rather than to raise awareness about something already supported. 
(And if Israel is condemned a thousand times harsher than other countries, it could be 1) because they’re doing something really bad or 2) because they boast a more Westernized lifestyle by destroying their neighbors, which is something generally the have’s shouldn’t do to the have-not’s)
Here’s whats wrong….its all part of a larger anti-Israel sentiment that attacks Israel with a DOUBLE STANDARD and DISPROPORTIONATELY.  This is most clearly seen in the international community (especially in the UN) where Israel is condemned and condemned a thousand times in the harshest of terms  before countries like China, Sudan, Egypt, Saudia Arabia, and Syria, which commit acts of violence and repression a thousand times greater than anything Israel has ever come close to, are even given a slap on the wrist or politely asked to stop!!
And your comparison between questioning the actions of those countries versus Israel is extremely unfair.  The three countries you mentioned are dictatorial to repressive to closed societies while Israel is an open society and the only democracy in the entire middle east (no, this does not mean it has no problems or faults of its own, but it puts in on a level a whole lot better than you give credit).
Even if you could equate the US questioning dictatorial and repressive regimes with attacking Israel, then why does Israel get attacked and chewed out so much more than any other country on college campuses? Shouldnt the worst conflicts and abuses be getting the most attention or at least equal attention? The day I see one anti-Cuba speaker, one anti-China speaker, one anti-Saudi Arabia speaker, one anti-Algeria speaker, and one anti-Syria speaker for every anti-Israel speaker is the day i’ll believe its actually a genuine human rights issue and not a malicious and disproportionate attack on Israel.
  Give up the charade already…
An illegal blockade is an illegal blockade. Stop trying to muffle criticism because it’s “unfair”. $3 billion of U.S. foreign aid and billions in military hardware go there every year. Does the same apply to Algeria? Are American citizens being killed because of the government’s support of Sudan? 
When a country starts 2 wars in 3 years, I don’t care who they are, they deserve criticism. When a country commits an illegal blockade and starves a population before, during, and after killing 1300 members of that community, I don’t care who they are, they deserve criticism.
Alison,
You’re right, an injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.  However, the fact that it is such disproportionate attack is testament, a sign, an indication of something greater, of a greater political motivation that simply fighting for human rights or an end to conflict.  That is why I question it.  If you are so passionate and aggressive in condemning Israel for the civilians killed who you believe died because of Israel’s actions, why are you not as aggressive in criticizing Sudan when literally hundreds of thousands of people have been murdered and raped in ethnic cleansing.  But rarely ever do we see as angry and persistent demonstration against Sudan, or China, or Saudi Arabia, or Algeria, or Zimbabwe, or a slate of other countries that commit attrocities that make the Israeli-Palestinian conflict pale in comparison.  
So yes, when you see that the vast majority of UN resolutions are solely against Israel, you would think that its because it must be doing something “really bad”, but the reality is that its all political and the same old Israel bashing that has been around for decades.  
And god bless America for supporting Israel in the face of so many ill wishers and people who would like to see Israel ended.  I am not even Jewish but I will never stop supporting Israel.
Jessica,
Don’t rank, or assign some arbitrary value to human suffering. That is a level to which I will not stoop.  I’m not playing that game with you.
In regards to democracies in the Middle East, last I checked Lebanon uses a democratic form of government, and a few others.  So again, that arguments is wrong.  And we say we went to Iraq to save them and install our white horse democracy there (we see how well that is working).  Besides that, let’s not forget that democracy isn’t always peachy.  It can be used to violate the rights of the minority.  We in the US have firsthand experience of that.  
But in relation to Israel this opens a whole new bag of tricks that isn’t appropriate to get into here.  That was not my argument in my post for this article.  If you want to talk to me further about the host of UN resolutions that Israel has ignored, read my post below and contact me separately.  Please.
Sorry for the double post I thought the first time did not go up
Yes Jack we also give 3 billion dollars in assistance every year to Egypt, as well as Saudi Arabia and a slew of other countries in the Middle East. Learn a little first before you ramble.
And I think you got it wrong…when a country gets attacked on regular intervals through massive conventional wars as well as terrorist proxy wars since 1948, it is remarkable that it is still an open and free society that values human rights.  Perhaps we should be outraged at groups like Hamas for instigating wars and hiding behind civilians to increase collateral damage and score media points.  Let’s remember that every time Palestinian civilians are killed, Hamas wins.
Jessica,
I feel like you are deluded as to who and why people are criticized.
There are sanctions on Sudan, and a trade blockade. Same with Syria. and Iran. What more would you like?
There is no real conflict regarding Algeria’s government right now, I’m not sure what you think you’re talking about.
The reason we target Israel is because the US gives $3 billion a year, mostly in military aid, to the country! These are OUR tax dollars. I also object to the money given to Egypt- but this is mostly civilian aid, and it is only given because of the Egyptian government’s stance on Israel.
I focus on Israel because it is a human rights abuser, and it uses our taxes to do so. The fact that Israel has an open press is the biggest shame about the matter- in other democracies, OPEN DEBATE leads people to OPPOSE SLAUGHTER. in Israel, open debate leads people to SUPPORT SLAUGHTER, OCCUPATION, and APARTHEID. In Sudan if people oppose genocide they can’t speak up- the same in other places. But in Israel people actively support brutality!!!! Absolutely shameful!!
“Yes Jack we also give 3 billion dollars in assistance every year to Egypt, as well as Saudi Arabia and a slew of other countries in the Middle East. Learn a little first before you ramble.”
Never said the United States didn’t. You clearly ignored all other points of my post though, which is hardly “rambling”.
“And I think you got it wrong…when a country gets attacked on regular intervals through massive conventional wars as well as terrorist proxy wars since 1948, it is remarkable that it is still an open and free society that values human rights.”
Do these human rights include illegal human blockades, routine breaking of sound barriers, not letting scholars leave Occupied Territories, and banning Arab parties in election? Read the U.S. State Department annual report on Human Rights in the Occupied Territories… that’ll explain so called “freedom and democracy” which applies to a select # of group. And that still doesn’t justify the killing of 1300 people. If the United States was a democracy in the 19th century, does that justify the genocide of Native Americans? Britain was a “democracy”, does that justify colonization in Africa and Asia? 
“Let’s remember that every time Palestinian civilians are killed, Hamas wins.”
I don’t even know to analyze that statement. So the 4 Palestinian, unarmed teenagers killed this past weekend? That was justified? Under what grounds?

While earthquakes, health care reform and Tiger Woods have dominated mainstream news in the last months, there’s another story that has been steadily making waves in the international and online world — Google vs. China.
In January, Google claimed to be the victim of a hacking attack that originated from computers in China. In response, it decided to go against a 2006 deal it had with the Communist country and no longer filtered search results on the Chinese version of its website.
China retaliated by demanding stronger filters and threatened to block Google from its citizens. Most recently Google made its final push for power in the struggle by rerouting all Chinese searches through its uncensored Hong Kong servers, effectively bypassing Chinese filters.
Although China could simply block any Chinese user from accessing the Hong Kong servers, that is besides the point. Google’s actions have shown how far the company is willing to fight for Internet freedom.
The Internet has been in a kind of limbo with lawmakers and companies — they don’t know how to treat it. It’s a tool for social networking and mass communication, yet it’s also a host for television and music. Plus it’s full of information, from published resources including PEW studies, articles from major magazines and participatory websites like Wikipedia.
Because it is a medium in which freedom of speech can run rampant, governments such as China’s are attempting to manipulate or suppress information on the web. They have blocked websites that discuss the Tiananmen Square protests, the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual sect and even social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
China’s actions cut off communication with millions of people and tried to rewrite cultural perceptions through information and meme control. The Internet is just a modern form of communication, as phones and mail were before it. The idea of censoring the mail is ludicrous, just as censoring the Internet should be.
During the first conflict between China and Google, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about the United States’ Internet policy. Extending the First Amendment to the Internet, she said, “the freedom to connect is like the freedom of assembly in cyberspace.”
There is a bit of a gray area when it comes to Internet freedom, though. Google, complying with German law, blocks any pro-Nazi website in the country. Similarly, there are many websites on the web that are from pro-hate and terrorist groups. Should they be repressed or should freedom of speech extend to all users on the Internet?
Like in the real world, people can say what they want — it is actions that are criminal, not speech. So, although we may not agree with what is on the Internet, we should not compromise free speech simply to stop cases here and there.
China blocks social networking sites out of fear that people will share information. That fear isn’t unfounded — just look at what sites like YouTube and Twitter did during Iran’s elections last summer.
The Iranian government kicked all foreign reporters out of the country, yet the citizens still shared videos, articles and pictures through the web.
The Internet served as a platform for mass communication and helped highlight the oppression that occurred in the country.
And even if governments choose to censor sites, people will find a way around it. In China, 384 million people use the Internet, and there is a vibrant illegal file-sharing culture. People have a taste for what the Internet offers, and they are going to try to get more of that, no matter how illegal it may be.
Oppression gives rise to rebellion. In America, file sharing and Wi-Fi hacking emerged out of a desire for free services. Just imagine the ingenuity and efforts going on in China to obtain free and uncensored Internet access.
Thankfully, our government has moved toward promoting Internet freedom. In addition to Clinton’s comments, a bipartisan group of senators formed the Senate Global Internet Freedom Caucus. The group formed soon after the Treasury Department authorized U.S. companies to send social media services and software to other countries to promote global communication.
So, while Google’s war over censorship in China might or might not come out in its favor, Internet freedom is at least being talked about. The more people realize that the Internet is an extension of speech and information, the more they will realize that those should not be censored or oppressed. China may pull the plug on Google, but sooner or later, its hold over the Internet will collapse. There are already dozens of cracks in the levee. The only question is how soon until the dam bursts.

In a joint media briefing, Andrew Guzman discussed his vision and the importance of continuing diversity initiatives.

Google’s recent decision to stop censoring results on its Chinese website and redirect Chinese users to its uncensored Hong Kong site has caused substantial contention among various communities. The Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper, the People’s Daily, denounced Google’s apparent objective and moral façade.
The company is “not a virgin when it comes to values. Its cooperation and collusion with the U.S. intelligence and security agencies is well-known,” an article said.
Chinese experts have also said that Google will suffer by losing a vital partner in China. In fact, China represents the world’s largest Internet market with 400 million users, and the country’s two largest cellular communication companies are expected to end their respective deals with Google.
Human rights activists have applauded the company for maintaining a position of unrestricted information and setting a precedent for future censorship issues.
This standoff between two giants triggers a certain memory, though one on a much smaller scale. At my high school, being protected from taboo subjects and certain articles by reputable news sources like Newsweek wasn’t uncommon. In no way are such restrictions in high schools the same as China’s expansive human rights violations and hacking activities. The two are conducted with different intentions and have vastly different implications. But in the end, it is wrong to block content of any kind.
Some limitations were reasonable — no high school student should be accessing pornographic sites at school. Other times, particularly when researching to write articles for the newspaper, the censorship was exasperating, and hindered us from accessing sites with content the school district deemed inappropriate or objectionable. That content included information remotely related to illegal drugs, homosexuality and everything conventionally considered taboo. So without access to information that was vital to our research and should have been accessible, it obstructed our work and only added to our frustration.
As members of Generation Y, which makes up a substantial population of Internet users, firewalls merely cause resistance. Blindly blocking people from accessing content doesn’t teach or protect them from anything. On the contrary, it inspires creative methods to bypass and defy authority. The information on the web is for everyone’s use, and mistrusting people’s abilities or intentions is insulting.

Governing as a helicopter parent authority is stifling to the people of a nation and only brews dissent. Think about ourselves as college students: Being monitored and unreasonably censored in any sense ultimately carries with it more costs than benefits to authority figures.
Similarly, Chinese Google users are usually well educated and have the ability and willpower to speak up.
As New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof put it, “Young Chinese are impatient for change, and their impatience is compounded by the siren song of the West.” The Chinese Politburo wants to restrict the free flow of information on the Internet, but its people are diametrically opposed to such censorship.
Thus, for the Chinese government to regard Google as an enemy against its people would be a huge mistake . Furthermore, having a dominant world power as a symbol of censorship probably won’t win many enthusiasts over.
Such a divergence in opinion between the people and the government raises numerous red flags. If the government cannot lead the people into believing in censorship, coercion alone won’t do the job. This disconnect is not only embarrassing for Beijing, but it essentially undermines the use of the Internet.
Sure, Google may lose the Chinese market and its governmental support, but its revenue from the Chinese market — between $250 and $300 million — is a drop in the ocean compared to Google’s total annual revenue of $24 billion. Google said it refuses to act as an “agent of the Chinese government,” and instead abides by its name and mission — making the world’s googolplex of information universally accessible.
Senator Byron L. Dorgan, (D-N.D.) said to the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, “Information is not to be feared, and ideas are not enemies to be crushed. The truth is China too often wants a one-way relationship with the world.”
What is also true is that a one-way relationship in any context isn’t sustainable.

I also appreciate that Google eventually stuck to some scruples and avoided obligatory censorship.  I always find myself somewhat conflicted when it comes to issues of censorship, however.  In a perfect world, people could use morals and reason to guide their actions and no one would have to worry about media content.  But in this imperfect world, I have no issue with censorship laws that prohibit pornographic billboards, for example.  And children (minors) cannot take legal action against parents who put content filters on their computers and televisions…  Certainly a link could be made suggesting that Beijing sees itself in a parental capacity over its citizens.  And maybe some sites would be better off censored, but it’s more likely that the power to censor would corrupt more severely than the power to watch all kinds of trash on the Internet and television.  Censorship is like holding a tifet by the tail, I suppose.
An editorial note: it’s odd that you wrote about China saying, “But in the end, it is wrong to block content of any kind,” then followed it with commentary on your school policy: “Some limitations were reasonable…”
*censorship is like holding a TIGER by the tail. :)
BTW, GOOG may’ve done  the right thing this time, but it is becoming the next Microsoft, a worse one without Bill Gates. Losing China means you lose your biggest growth potential. GOOG has already stepped on too many people’s toe, and we all are waiting for the day it falls.

Pico. Figueroa. Spring.
We might walk, drive or bike the often-maddening grid of memorable Los Angeles streets, but knowledge of their namesakes remain elusive to even natives of the city.
Though L.A.’s history is one with many layers, our neighbors at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles have created an ingenious six-part YouTube series that peels these layers away, going behind Downtown’s landmarks and exposing the people and events related to some of the area’s oldest names.
Not surprisingly, many of the early street names can be traced back to the days when Lala Land was El Pueblo de la Reina de Los Angeles and the first few videos in the series refer back to 1800s-era diseños, or maps, to show these origins.
Starting with Chinatown’s Ord Street — named for Edward C. Ord, who drew the first land survey of Los Angeles — the series discusses the reasoning behind Downtown’s street names such as Washington Boulevard, Pico Avenue and Alvarado Avenue.
As the city spread outward from the pueblo’s core, areas and streets bore the names of its Mexican history as well as Los Angeles’ first winemakers, landowners, developers, settlers and government officials.
But while some streets paid homage to people involved in their creation, others have been named for their physical landmarks (such as Downtown’s Aliso Street being named for its identifiable sycamore tree named El Aliso), national civil rights leaders (Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard) or pay tribute to longtime local citizens (Georgia Street near the Staples Center).
Pairing old photographs and documents housed in the NHM’s own Seaver Center for Western History Research with current images of the streets being discussed, the videos are educational, but not boring. They acknowledge the city’s multicultural beginnings and put particular emphasis on the Mexican heritage that thrives today.
Easy to watch and guaranteed to teach you something new, the NHM’s “Street Names of Los Angeles — A History” series is one worth catching up with.

It’s difficult to say whether grief or love is the greatest emotion one can experience. Both are overwhelming, full-body sensations that tend to linger long after the damage is done.
Motherhood · Carey Mulligan, recently nominated for an Oscar for her role in An Education, plays Rose in Shana Feste’s The Greatest. - Photo courtesy of Paladin Pictures 
So it’s no surprise, then, how one can replace the other over time.
In The Greatest, a character-driven family drama that premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, first-time writer-director Shana Feste explores the numerous intricacies and nuances of emotions ranging from distress to apathy, trauma to understanding. A family is broken, a lover is struggling to pick up the pieces and the unrelenting sense of loss hangs like a heavy veil overhead.
Even the film’s prologue, a tastefully steamy scene between young lovers, is shrouded in a sense of bittersweet nostalgia from the first frame. We meet teenagers Bennett (Aaron Johnson) and Rose (Carey Mulligan) as they hurry to undress each other in the fading light of the afternoon. They’re giddy, clumsy and overcome with infatuation.
Afterward, as Bennett drives Rose home, he capriciously halts his car in the middle of a wooded, dimly lit highway. Just as he turns to Rose and says, “I love you,” a truck crashes into the sedan, and it all fades to black.
In the aftermath, we meet Bennett’s family, the Brewers: his obsessive mother Grace (Susan Sarandon), unfaithful father Allen (Pierce Brosnan) and screw-up younger brother, Ryan (Johnny Simmons). What unfolds is, at first, a by-the-numbers tale of grief and familial ties.
But between Grace’s overwrought outbursts, Allen’s steadfast determination to go about his days and Ryan’s drug binges, the Brewers are struck with another, arguably as painful, shock — Rose is pregnant with Bennett’s child.
Without a home or family of her own, Rose approaches the Brewers and, much to Grace’s resentment, is taken in by Allen. It’s a refreshing, if a bit of a deus ex machina twist that allows for fresh relationships and bonds not often seen on-screen to form.
An introspective filmmaker with an eye and ear for realism, Feste exudes a languid 70s-era sensibility often associated with independent auteurs like Robert Altman. She uses the camera as a quiet intruder, moving at a slow and steady pace through the Brewer’s household, catching in minute moments how their lives have been altered and how, more significantly, Rose struggles to desperately piece together the life of her child’s father, whom she barely knew.
Yet when compared to 2008’s Rachel Getting Married, another loosely woven family drama that set no limits on the range of the camera lens, The Greatest seems like a diluted imitation where the camera is barred from the rooms that hold the most secrets.
Although The Greatest failed to garner acclaim and hype at Sundance like several of its highly touted peers, including Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire and An Education, the film’s yearlong wait for its limited theatrical release has swiftly morphed from a frustration to a blessing in disguise.
That blessing? The new wave of success for the film’s centerpiece, Carey Mulligan.
If it were not for Mulligan, the recent Academy Award-nominated 24-year-old who has swiftly become the “It girl” in Hollywood circles, The Greatest would be standard independent fare — and average, at best.
Mulligan’s turn as Rose, however, is truly the anchor of this film, grounding not only audience members to their seats but also the on-screen characters to their oft-forgotten reality. Possessing a certain je ne sais quoi quality to her acting, Mulligan is poised without ever being mechanical. Her facial expressions, inflections and tears are exact, yet reveal themselves rawly, as if she had never experienced those emotions before. She outshines Brosnan, a typically endearing actor, in each scene, and her on-screen appearances opposite the ever-brilliant Sarandon are the most electrifying to watch.
The Greatest also features a surprise supporting performance from Michael Shannon — who plays the truck driver who rammed his tractor-trailer into Bennett’s car — that at once solidifies his 2009 Academy Award nomination for Revolutionary Road and reaffirms his status as one of the finest if underappreciated character actors working today. What stands as more of a testament to Shannon’s talent is that he does it all in a mere five minute scene — a brief but climactic encounter with Sarandon toward the film’s end.
Although the performances — save for Brosnan’s incredibly forced bawling moment — ring true to Feste’s realism, the film’s spotless ending does not. Lives this uncertain and messy do not clean up quickly without so much of a scuff mark left behind; the closure appears more rushed than honest.
This problem hinders many contemporary indie films, especially in an age where most studio-attached independent production houses have folded and distributors are few and far between. A film is much more likely to sell to a distributor (and bring in an audience) if the ending delivers closure or satisfaction to the viewers. As a result, independent films have started to lose their street cred by tying their third acts into neat, little bows instead of letting their endings unravel, leaving them torn and frayed.
Yet happy endings do not necessarily equal closure, and the audience is left more cheated than pleasant at The Greatest’s end credits.
Feste’s bold, defining voice makes her directorial debut a poignant, heartrending drama — but it’s not the greatest.

USC’s Master of Accounting program at the Leventhal School was recently ranked one of the top-10 most popular programs for Chinese citizens applying to graduate business schools — the only non-MBA program to make the cut.
Rising numbers · The Leventhal School of Accounting’s Master of Accounting program was recently named one of the top-10 choices for graduate students from China looking to study business. - Daily Trojan | Geo Tu
According to the Geographic Trend Report for Graduate Management Admission Test Examinees, USC Leventhal’s Master of Accounting program was ranked 10th among the programs to which Chinese citizens sent their GMAT score reports in 2009.
Shirley Maxey, a director of the Leventhal masters program, said the ranking is significant for Leventhal.
“It means a lot for the program,” Maxey said. “It means we’re going to continue to have a rising number of applications, and that’s great for the school.”
Harvard, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford topped the list of the most popular schools among Chinese applicants.
“The top ten are all great universities,” Maxey said. “It’s just amazing we’re on that list.”
Cindy Wu, a student in the program who is originally from the Guangdong Province in China, said she made her decision based on the rankings she found online.
“USC was right at the top of the list,” Wu said. “And it was one of only two schools that offered a Master of Accounting program.”
The school received about 475 applications for the 2010-2011 school year, according to Cathy Cowan, a director of the program. Two years ago, the program received less than half this number.
USC has increased its acceptance of international students over the past five years, Maxey said, noting that other programs across the nation were reducing their numbers because of the difficulty of placing international students in career positions in the United States.
In China and many other Asian countries, the reputation of a university can be a big factor in the decision to attend, Maxey said.
Yifeng Song, a student in the program, heard about it while she was majoring in international business at Guangzhou University in China.
“I wanted to pursue accounting here because it’s highly ranked among these kinds of programs,” Song said. “USC has a really good reputation in China.”
Maxey noted that many applicants have told her USC is their dream school.
“[USC] was my top choice,” Song said. “It’s a highly recognized program throughout China, so it will help if I go back to China to work.”
The Master of Accounting program has started receiving so many applications from China that it now sends interviewers from Leventhal overseas to conduct interviews with the applicants.
The program has also made great efforts to reach out to prospective students. Two of USC’s accounting faculty members, Thomas Lin and Shiing-Wu Wang, have both traveled to China at least once per year for more than a decade to speak at conferences and establish ties with academics in Shanghai and Beijing, Maxey said.
Maxey said part of the reason for Leventhal’s increasing popularity could be the recent economic growth in China, which has resulted in higher demand for trained accounting professionals throughout the country.
The program also makes a point to put international and domestic students together in the same classrooms, Maxey said. She said both groups benefit from the experience of working and learning together in the classroom setting.
Students said the atmosphere of Southern California was also a factor in the decision to come to USC.
“The faculty are excellent, and it’s in a good location,” Song said. “I love it here. That’s how I can adapt to the new life, the new language and the new learning methods.”
Song said she also appreciated the strong network of USC alumni throughout the world and that an education in the United States has broadened her horizons.
“Pursuing study is also about experiencing a new culture and a new life, especially for international students,” she said.
Joe,
Advanced economies prize professional services and the exchange of information, not simply those with the ability to sustain the infrastructure that conducts the relatively mundane task of transmitting that information. I make a very good living in marketing and public relations.
UnAmerican, maybe you should try encouraging some American kids to buckle down and study useful subjects like accounting, engineering, computer science, medicine, architecture, etc, instead of getting all huffy at the Chinese for doing so. Some of the most popular majors for American college students are psychology (worthless), political science (worthless), marketing (the least practical major in the business school), and a bunch of other useless fluffy subjects.
In other words, don’t blame the Chinese for investing in the future. Blame America for selling it.
It’s China’s turn to shine right? China owns a vast majority of the U.S. T-bills, essentially they own the U.S. The yuan is undervalued favoring China in its exports. 
Now they own USC as well. It’s no longer the “University of Southern California.” It’s the “University Subsidized by the Chinese.” 
When is USC going to stop riding on Chinese students’ preferences to boost their reputation? Is USC losing its focus as an American university?

The Office of Globalization has opened an office in Seoul, South Korea, the sixth of its international offices and the second to open this school year. USC hopes the new office will increase educational collaboration between Korea and the United States and provide new opportunities for USC students in Seoul.
USC Korea’s Opening Ceremony took place March 15, hosted by Vice Provost for Globalization Adam Powell and USC Trustee Yang Ho Cho, the only Korean national to be on a board of trustees at any major university in the United States.
The office will be directed by Steven Lee, a professor of East Asian languages and cultures. Lee said he sees great potential for USC to grow through its relationship with Korea.
“Korea has one of the fastest emerging economies in the world, and one of the world’s best-educated citizenry,” Lee said. “Consequently, Korea has become Asia’s hub for economic and education development. Capitalizing on these factors and extending on USC’s mission to offer opportunities for global education, Korea is an ideal place for USC.”
The goals of the new office in Korea include advancing research partnerships with foreign universities, prospective partners and government agencies; providing an increased amount of internships abroad for USC students; and identifying schools and students with the potential to assist in recruiting graduate and undergraduate students for USC.
According to Powell, USC has historically had a very strong relationship with Korea, hosting thousands of Korean students over the years — 873 currently. Korea is the third most-represented country at USC, behind only India and China, and the alumni association in South Korea has the largest membership of any foreign institution in that country.
USC Korea, the first U.S. university program to be approved as a nonprofit by the Korean government, represents the university’s increasing interest in Asia. Powell said Asian countries including China, Korea and India are of great interest to the USC faculty because of research and internship opportunities.
“We’re getting more interest from all departments each year in international partnerships and global research,” Powell said. “[Executive Vice President and Provost C. L. Max] Nikias asked me last year to double our programs in Asia — he believes it’s an essential investment in USC’s future, and so do the rest of the faculty.”
Of USC’s six current international offices, five are located in Asia and the next office slated to open will be in Mumbai, India. The other international office is in Mexico City.
Pei-Hsuan Chu, the director of the Taiwan Office in Taipei, which opened in 1998, said she thinks the university’s global push has been successful thus far.
“As far as I know, there is no school that is doing what we have been doing [in Taiwan],” Chu said. “No other university is as thoroughly involved in overseas education as we are; being on the ground allows local people to learn more about USC in their own language and their own culture.”
Pei’s sentiment is echoed by the faculty of the other international offices.
“Apart from Boston University, which has a local office mainly responsible for admissions, USC is the only university with a local office to not only manage admission procedures but also to assist with numerous events and activities in Hong Kong such as career placement and alumni relations,” said Sarah Lee, administrative and event officer for the Shanghai office.
The Mumbai office is scheduled to open late this summer and the university is hoping to launch another international office as soon as 2012, though the location has not yet been confirmed.
USC’s expansion into Asia also extends beyond the Korea office and the upcoming India office. In 2012, USC plans to open its Asia Global University campus, which will allow students to take USC courses in Korea.
“We live in an increasingly globalized world, and we’re trying to really invent what it is to be a global university,” Powell said. “Our network of international offices is a big part of that; we’re aiming to establish USC as a de facto capital of the Pacific Rim, a seamless hub of educational experience — national and international. That’s what our vision is here.”
Korea is a very corrupt communist country, why would we go there?
Please tell me you’re not an SC student, because you need to take some international relations or ethnic studies classes.

What does ‘radical’ really mean?
I was amused to read that the USC College Republicans’ “teach-in” was entitled “…to Oppose Obama’s Radical Transformation of America.” It seems like USC’s Republicans have a very different idea of “radical” from most of us. President Barack Obama’s health insurance reforms were partially inspired by the policy advocates who inspired Gov. Mitt Romney’s own plan in Massachusetts.
Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist who advised both Obama and Romney on health insurance programs, told the Boston Globe that Romney’s health care reform effort as governor paved the way for national reform.
“[Romney] is in many ways the intellectual father of national health reform,” he said.
Obama’s plan also bears a more than passing resemblance to President Richard Nixon’s reform plan. Add in the fact that Obama took many ideas from a bipartisan Brookings Institution paper on “Bending the Curve” as well as incorporating many GOP ideas from within Congress (even if they didn’t vote for it), and you have to wonder if the term “radical” has lost all meaning.
Notwithstanding the demagoguery of Obama’s desperately needed reform of a broken health insurance system, it seems that Republicans are as “radical” as ever when it comes to their own policy ideas.
When will they realize that cutting taxes only makes deficits worse? And when will they say which entitlements — the bulk of federal spending — they would do away with to balance the budget? Social Security? Medicare?
Americans must either pay for the highways, education, health care and research needed to keep up with a rising China or risk running huge deficits indefinitely. It’s not surprising that Obama has had to spend when the private sector refuses to, but it is also no surprise that the only two presidents to have run surpluses since the World War II have been Democrats.
Unfunded tax cuts to the richest, opposing reforming a broken health insurance system, a mess of a foreign policy and bought and paid for by Wall Street; it wouldn’t be so bad if they were not the ones calling others “radical.”

Nothing out of the ordinary about search process
Laura Cueva’s article “Controversy Growing at USC Hospital” casts the efforts of USC University Hospital administrators to collaborate with hospital employees in a very peculiar and pejorative light.
Hiring a consulting firm to try and determine whether it is possible and how to make work conditions sufficiently attractive to employees so that the employees might voluntarily choose to forego a union is not union-busting. It is called providing people with a good place to work. Asking employees about the quality of their work experience with an eye toward a good work environment is just responsible management.
It is nothing nefarious.

Excellent points, Joe.
Oh man! You guys are hilarious. We need to stop the spending spree!!! But not stop spending a trillion plus dollars on two wars that have killed untold numbers of peoples and don’t seem to be going away!!!
Some people think winning wars is an important job of the federal government, even more important than funneling trillions of dollars from the middle class into slush funds to buy votes and pay off Democrat party allies. That’s a philosophy that’s out there. I’m just saying.
Indeed, I think the College Republicans could have named their event better. First of all, it is a negative name, sure to turn off liberals and independents who might have been receptive to hearing a presentation about the GOP message. Second, the term “radical” is not really appropriate for a leftist ideologue who simply wants to repeat the same stupid ideas put forth by every tyrant and dictator from Napoleon to Mussolini to Castro. There’s nothing new and different about Obama’s naked socialism, crass identity politics, and culture of corruption.
The most radical ideas ever conceived by man are the ones that the American revolutionaries fought and died for: that free men and women with faith in God and the right to do as they pleased with the fruits of their labor would  produce more prosperity, peace, and voluntary generosity than any empire or dictatorship ever could. These principles were counter-intuitive: that truth wins when fools are allowed the freedom of speech; that the poor become richer when they don’t rob from their rich neighbors; that self-interested citizens would willingly volunteer to fight for liberty without a draft. The title of the presentation could have just as well been: “Why America’s principles are still the most radical political philosophy on earth… and why Republicans fight for them!”
Simon Radford’s letter repeats the same tired dogma regarding what’s wrong with America, reflecting an ignorance of the broad sweep of history. Wall Street corruption is indisputably tied with the Democratic Party, in point of fact; it is sheer intellectual laziness to put that at the GOP’s feet. That is but one example of the kneejerk anti-GOP sentiment here. Although Simon makes a very few legit points (Obamacare vs Romneycare might be something to debate), the whole argument about which presidents ran surpluses is terribly misleading as it is Congress who SPENDS THE MONEY. And that is where Simon is most disingenuous, because he trots out the old “when are Republicans going to come up with a plan” mantra. Hey dude maybe you should check out Fox News, since they are apparently the only ones reporting on a plethora of Republican plans, including the excellent Ryan Roadmap which is a very very tough but much-needed answer to the question of how are we going to stop this insane spending spree the Democrats are enjoying (while too many GOP have looked the other way). Finally, USC’s College Republicans are not at all far off in calling Obama “radical.” He has radical friends, he espouses radical causes, and he himself wants to radically transform the country. That’s the definition of radical, and they were absolutely correct to characterize him as such. Your letter makes no dent in that argument whatsoever.

USC’s recycling efforts could still be improved, but as students who toured USC’s waste management facility Tuesday found out, more than half of USC’s waste is ultimately diverted from landfills.
USC waste management and the Undergraduate Student Government led a tour Tuesday of the Athens Services Material Recovery Facility, which handles USC’s waste. The tour was intended to give students deeper insight into how recycling works at USC.
“Most people don’t know about recycling at USC,” said John Baldo, USG director of university affairs. “There’s this huge perception [that] we don’t recycle.”
According to Eric Johnson of USC waste management, USC collected a total of 7,695 tons of waste in 2009. Of that waste, 3,899 of those tons were recycled, giving the school a diversion rate of 51 percent.
Everything put into USC’s trash and recycling bins goes to either the Athens Services facility in the City of Industry, Calif., or to a recycling plant closer to USC, said Mario Gutierrez, vice president of operations at Athens Services, who headed the tour.
At the facility, waste is generally sorted into a processing pile and a transfer pile at the beginning of each process. The processing pile is sorted for recyclables while the transfer pile goes straight to a landfill.
“Some loads aren’t worth processing,” Gutierrez said. “We see if it’s what we call ‘fluffy’ or ‘not fluffy’ — ‘fluffy’ being the good, recyclable material. I have to be really selective about the material process.”
Gutierrez said the facility does as much as it can to divert trash from landfills. It takes trash from all over the San Gabriel Valley, and about 25 percent of the waste gets diverted from landfills.
Sorters at the facility divide wood, metal, paper and plastic into specific areas, where they are sorted further for processing.
Some material is then baled together and sent overseas. China, for example, pays the facility to export paper and plastics. Textiles are burned at a special facility to produce electricity, and food waste is sent to a composting facility in Victorville, Calif.
Though USC’s diversion rate is 51 percent, there are ways to improve it, Baldo said.
“If we sort trash [before it goes to the facility], we can get above that 50 percent,” Baldo said.
USC currently uses a two-bin system. Everything placed in bins designated for recycling actually goes to a separate recycling plant closer to USC, while all of the waste that gets placed in normal trash bins goes to the Athens plant to be sorted.
“Separate your recycling,” Gutierrez said. “Whatever we take to the other recycling center — the university gets all of that material back. That’s where you’re going to get more bang for your buck.”
Johnson said it is important for students to feel responsible for and excited about recycling efforts.
“Students need to know what is recyclable and where they can throw it,” Johnson said in an e-mail. “It seems easy, but many of us throw away something that can be recycled in a trash container because it is more convenient.”
Students on the tour said they were glad to see that USC is working to be sustainable.
“I’m pleased that USC actually goes through their garbage,” said Brandie Gordon, a senior majoring in political science who went on the tour. “I didn’t know how important it was to sort trash and that food waste could ruin recyclables.”
Baldo said he thought, overall, the tour went well.
“We want to show students what’s going on with trash — how we do things and how we can do it better, and thinking about how it can improve,” Baldo said.
Most of all, the tour quelled concerns that USC doesn’t recycle.
“Students have a lot of concerns, but if it gets into USC bins, it will be processed,” Gutierrez said.
It’s probably worth checking on Athens’s claims. According to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, Athens’s facility in Industry is an environmental disaster, and Athens recently paid the biggest AQMD fine in history.

If T-Pain’s brief performance at Springfest didn’t quite satisfy your appetite for music, then Chinatown has something a bit more substantial to offer — in vinyl.
Sunday was the second annual Los Angeles Beat Swap Meet in Downtown Chinatown. Audiophiles of all ages were invited to attend a celebration of music at the Grandstar Jazz Club from noon until 6 p.m. The event featured live performances and a bar for those lucky visitors who met the age requirement. More than 30 record vendors and collectors were invited to share their ware.
The stock was impressive, with blues, disco, funk, hip hop, jazz, punk, reggae, rock and foreign music. Hip hop was alive and thriving upstairs, with Beat Swap Meet’s first ever D.J. showdown. Outside the club, independent vendors and designers gathered to sell their goods to an enthusiastic audience.
Chinatown is chock full of events for the musically inclined and artistically curious, if one only bothers to seek them out. I had an enjoyable afternoon at the cozy venue and hope to come back in the future.
One of the best parts of the event is the charitable aspect: As long as they bring donations of canned food to the event, people of all ages may attend free of charge. All other donations are encouraged in the name of helping the homeless community in Los Angeles. The Grandstar Jazz Club is located on 943 N. Broadway.

It always seems the Internet is under attack. Every week some fresh outrage breaks out over something that has appeared online. Sometimes it’s a morality issue stemming from some indecent website or video.
This time the website in question is WikiLeaks.org. The site recently leaked footage from 2007 that shows an attack by American helicopters on a group of Iraqis that killed two Reuters reporters and a handful of civilians.
WikiLeaks came under fire immediately for the video and was forced to contend with accusations of impeding a military investigation, leaking sensitive government material and showing a complete lack of civic responsibility by posting the video. Some have called the site a collection of hearsay and unchecked facts.
However, all of these critics are missing the point of WikiLeaks: it is a brilliant new take on political activism.
Internet activism is nothing new, but it has sadly been shortchanged and underestimated. When it comes to Internet activism, most people simply think of donating money to political candidates’ campaign websites, best typified by the drive for online fundraising that helped finance Barack Obama’s successful bid for the presidency in 2008. However, there is much more to it then that.
The Internet is essentially the ultimate hybrid of communication technology and information storing. All it takes is an Internet connection to share documents instantly, send mass e-mails across the globe and network in ways that regular activists cannot.
The Internet has fostered the evolution of activism in many forms — there are now online flash mobs set up to protest human rights violations in China, and global petitions that sympathizers can sign electronically to help stop the spread of AIDS in Africa. Some even take more radical approaches, like flooding a disliked company’s website to crash the servers in protest.
Internet activism has evolved alongside social networking. As more people are able to interact with one another, they can share more information over a greater area and at a faster rate. They just need a central hub to compile this information so that they can link to it: That’s where WikiLeaks comes in.
Despite its name, the site has nothing to do with Wikipedia — the prefix wiki simply means a collaborative website. According to the site, WikiLeaks was founded by “Chinese dissidents, journalists, mathematicians and start-up company technologists” from around the world.
The site hosts suppressed documents as well as classified reports from governments and organizations. Many of these reports, like the recent video from Iraq, describe suspicious activities or abuses on the part of these groups. The goal is not to slander any group unjustly but to expose the world to the surreptitious activity of high-profile organizations and governments.
With no central figure, the site relies on a board of advisers and a series of experts to vet all submitted intelligence for authenticity and accuracy. The primarily volunteer-run servers of the site are located in Sweden, where the law defends Internet anonymity.
Since its launch in 2007, the site has not only exposed corruption in countries like Kenya but also used its resources and viral skills to defend journalists who face imprisonment for their stories. If that isn’t activism at its finest, then what is?
It is important to note that WikiLeaks is not itself the source of the leaked information. Government sources provide the video, so any claims to arrest or charge WikiLeak contributors with espionage don’t hold water. If people feel the need to press charges, they will have to find those responsible for the leaks.
In many ways, the controversy surrounding WikiLeaks is essentially a digital-age update of the Pentagon Papers scandal. In 1971, former military analyst Daniel Ellsberg leaked a classified report on unpublicized American acts in Vietnam and Cambodia to The New York Times. This led to lawsuits against Ellsberg and The New York Times, and ultimately the Times’ actions were ruled legal by the Supreme Court.
Going by that approach, WikiLeaks’ actions, no matter how radical, are simply legal forms of political activism and information dissemination. It is publicizing intelligence to expose corruption and abuse of power. It is simply doing what the media is expected to do: provide a check to the power of government. And in that case, it is succeeding.
The media serves to hold the government and other organizations accountable for their actions. In recent years, however, the traditional media has faltered in that approach, watering down its exposés and reports for fear of reprisal. WikiLeaks does not do this. It posts the full documents, unedited, and with full impact.
Should people hack government accounts and steal classified documents from organizations? No. But if someone on the inside leaks a sensitive report, what is wrong with there being a site that collects and showcases that report?
The press is one of the greatest checks on government corruption and abuse of power, and the Internet is finally stepping up to help. WikiLeaks is not some evil site trying to undermine civilization, but a great tool for political activism. And isn’t that what the Internet needs?

2010-04-19,USC,China,"The USC Viterbi School of Engineering’s graduate program fell from seventh to 10th on this year’s U.S. News & World Report Best Engineering Schools list after the administrating body corrected a reporting error that was largely responsible for the school’s high rank last year.
Pitfalls · USC’s Viterbi School of Engineering dropped three places in the U.S. News Rankings after correcting last year’s reporting error. - Daily Trojan file photo 
Viterbi ranked seventh last year, but in June Inside Higher Ed reported that Viterbi had inaccurately listed the number of faculty members who are part of the National Academy of Engineering, a high distinction in the field. U.S. News uses the percentage of NAE members on a school’s faculty as a criterion for ranking.
Because of what administrators said was an honest mistake, Viterbi reported the total number of NAE faculty members, not just full-time, tenure-track professors as the U.S. News survey stipulates.
This year, better attention was paid to the numbers reported, and Viterbi fell three places in the rankings.
“In the rankings that were published a year ago, the USC Viterbi School said they had 18.3 percent of faculty with NAE membership for the 2008 year,” said Robert Morse, Director of Data Research for U.S. News & World Report. “For the 2009 year, they said it was 8.9 percent. That was more or less the main reason why the school fell from seventh to tenth place.”
According to Leslie DaCruz, executive director of communications and marketing for Viterbi, the school, in response to U.S. News’s request, reported the number of tenured faculty with NAE membership for the 2010 rankings.
“Basically, we went to a stricter way of reporting and we knew it was going to affect our ranking in some way,” DaCruz said. “Being ranked 10 this year keeps us in great company.”
In addition to the change in the number of NAE faculty reported, the drop in rankings was also influenced by a combination of other factors, including the performance of other schools in the 10 metrics used for the calculations. Because schools submit new information for the rankings every year, there is always movement up and down.
For students considering graduate programs in engineering, rankings can factor into the decision.
Xiaoran Wang, a graduate student from China studying electrical engineering, said she looked at rankings over a period of years for the graduate programs she considered applying to and also considered admission rates, cost and location. The most important factor she considered, however, was the academic reputation of the school and the program she wanted to study.
“I think ranking was a very important factor when I chose a graduate school, [but] I think reputation was the most important because people in China prefer to go to high reputation schools; and reputation will help you find a job and get into doctorate programs,” Wang said.
Wang also added that USC’s drop on the list is not significant to her.
“I don’t think a change of three or four places is a huge drop. Ranks rise and fall, and [the drop] is not that important,” she said.
DaCruz said that the school is not concerned by the drop because of the natural fluctuation in rankings it has experienced over the years.
“Over the last 10 years, Viterbi has been from No. 12 to No. seven,” DaCruz said.“The rankings are one of many different measures and they really change. The important thing is the quality of education people get, and that’s the reason why they choose to come here.”
U.S. News & World Report surveyed 198 graduate programs in the country to get information used for the rankings. It calculated the rankings based on 10 criteria, including research expenditures, number of Ph.D. graduates, enrollment and graduate record examination scores.

When they say you shouldn’t medicate with food, what they really mean is that you shouldn’t medicate with a pint of Ben & Jerry’s Cherry Garcia.
In reality, your grocery store can be a go-to spot for many common ailments. People have battled hangovers since we discovered hops, and PMS is in no way a uniquely modern epidemic.
Of course, today’s medicine is a miracle, and these recommendations should not replace your prescriptions or doctor’s advice. But for a few common ailments, consider giving natural remedies a try. Here are a few conditions and some foods that can help.
Anxiety. Have three papers due and are still recovering from a No Doze overdose? Chill out with a steak — the B vitamins found in red meat help regulate the nervous system. The best mix of B vitamins are found in red meat, particularly liver, but other foods that include various B vitamins are seafood, sunflower seeds, black beans, corn, mushrooms and bell peppers. Tryptophan, found in spinach, beans and most famously turkey, as well as magnesium, present in dark chocolate, seeds, beans and most greens, both promote relaxation and better sleep.
Bloating. Tonight you have a hot date but your stomach’s looking eight months pregnant. Save your boyfriend a heart attack and drink some tea. Basil, peppermint, chamomile and ginger teas can all ease the gastrointestinal tumult associated with an upset stomach.
Hangover. If you can do more than groan from your fetal position on the bathroom floor, head to the kitchen. Start guzzling water to rehydrate, and, in between chugs, grab some toast and bananas — the starches will settle your stomach, the potassium will help with hydration and the magnesium will soothe your pounding headache. Add some peanut butter and honey for extra magnesium and better taste.
PMS. If you scoff, “Bah, all I need is chocolate,” when contending with your monthly symptoms, you’d be right. Dark chocolate, especially raw chocolate (cacao), is high in magnesium and manganese, two nutrients that reduce irritability. Other sources for these nutrients are sunflower and pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, pineapple, potatoes and spinach. Calcium and vitamin B-6 will also allay the PMS demons. Get your calcium from low-fat dairy and dark, leafy greens, and score B-6 with meat, oatmeal and fortified breakfast cereal. So yes, a bowl of Lucky Charms with peanut butter and chocolate chips can be medicinal — but best keep it on reserve for Dawn of the Dead-level cases.
Headache. When a tapping pencil sends waves of agony down your neck, it’s time to get your inner fatty on. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish such as salmon and sardines as well as flaxseeds and walnuts, are scientifically shown to reduce headaches. Also potent are calcium and magnesium, especially when taken together. For calcium, eat dairy products, blackstrap molasses, collard greens and kale. For magnesium, go for nuts (especially almonds), halibut, spinach, dark chocolate and potatoes.
Constipation. Don’t give yourself hemorrhoids — just upgrade your diet. Many fruits and leafy green vegetables will help get things moving because of a mix of antioxidants, fiber and juice. The best fruits for constipation are grapes, figs, pears, guavas, papayas and oranges. Three other keys to free-rolling glory are insoluble fiber found in oatmeal, whole grain bread and high fiber cereals such as Kashi GoLean; lubricating healthy fats such as olive oil and almond butter; and water, for hydrating your organs.
Diarrhea. At the more explosive end of the spectrum is the tail end of a night of drinking and Chano’s. In some ways, it’s best to let nature run its agonizing course, but a few foods can help. Starchy vegetables and legumes, especially carrots and lentils, replace lost nutrients and limit fluid loss. The tannin found in pomegranate, blueberries, blackberries and persimmons act as an astringent and will also help. If you aren’t lactose intolerant (a frequent cause of diarrhea), the probiotics in yogurt will strengthen your gut and replace beneficial flora. Translation: hit up Red Mango or Yogurtland.
Toothache. What if it’s Saturday and your mouth is throbbing? To make the wait for a Monday dentist appointment more bearable, chew on some cloves — they are natural pain relievers and have antiseptic properties. Another pain reliever is garlic, especially when sprinkled with salt. Also, for a preemptive strike, chewing on onions kills oral bacteria.
Common cold. You might have heard the old saying, “Feed a cold, starve a fever.” It’s time to get more precise. Indulge your Indian or Thai craving and order takeout. Turmeric, pepper, ginger, lemon and garlic are all great cold relievers. Turmeric is one of the most healing spices in the world — it’s an antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and detoxifier. Garlic is also antibacterial. Vitamin C-rich lemon can shorten the duration of a cold while ginger settles the stomach. In general, strong spices are great for opening up the sinuses. Just keep some tissues handy.
Sunburn. Blame it on falling asleep to good music. Either way, when your sexy summer tan becomes lobster-fied, it’s time to hit up the dairy aisle. To relieve pain, apply full-fat yogurt or a milk-soaked cloth to the skin for 20 minutes, then rinse. Starchy potatoes do the same thing. Prevent blisters by applying avocado, apple cider vinegar or lemon. For a simple cooling effect, apply chilled cucumbers, spa-style.
Loved your article! Very informative and witty! :)
Great article and you have a lot of good knowledge to share, but you can take healing  through diet much further.  Start by reading The China Study by T. Colin Campbell.  It covers decades of study proving that diet can be used to prevent, reduce and to even reverse the diseases that are plaguing our population: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and cancer.  Dr. Campbell provides peer reviewed data that a whole food plant based diet can do all that and more.    http://www.tcolincampbell.org

In a joint media briefing, Andrew Guzman discussed his vision and the importance of continuing diversity initiatives.

At the beginning of this semester, I entered a Monday class early to find several students sporadically placed around the 50-seat room. The class was “diversely” composed of white Americans, Asian-Americans and international students from China, South Korea and India.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
When I entered the room the following Wednesday, the class had completely self-segregated, with each nationality sitting together.
The class remained that way for the entire semester.
Though USC boasts the largest international student enrollment in the country with 6,600 students, real diversity relies on students, not administrators. We should embrace the diversity of our campus by intentionally overcoming social barriers.
In my four years here, I have observed this phenomenon in many classrooms and social situations. As far as I could tell, racism played no role in the self-segregation.
Rather, the self-segregation arose from a lack of conversational ease. To relate to international students, Americans must intentionally pursue conversation, asking questions, gaining understanding of culture and finding relatable qualities.
This direct approach often feels uncomfortable and forced — somewhat like a networking event. Perhaps because of our laziness, or our limited conversational abilities, we immediately gravitate toward the easy, familiar faces.
Stanford Professor Anthony Lising Antonio conducted a study at UCLA that suggests self-segregation is not a problem on the Westwood campus. He backed up his argument with student surveys that showed the plurality of “friend groups” had no racial majority.
Newsweek offered a divergent opinion from Antonio, referencing studies that concluded that students self-segregate by third grade in order to develop individual identity and pursue popularity.
Some students would counter Antonio’s conclusion by pointing out the existence of cultural student organizations and racially driven Greek communities.
But these organizations are not necessarily bad. Race and nationality play an important part of identity in America. Few people want to be the minority in a group, whether religious, racial, political, gender or other wise.
Consequently, people congregate around people with identifying characteristics and similar backgrounds, largely because it is easier to relate.
Many religious groups advocate for their idea of the truth. Blacks brace to fight oppression. LGBT groups bond over the belief in individual rights.
Amid all of this, our culture claims to celebrate diversity on the grounds that a multicultural society will give more opportunity to everyone.
USC’s administration strives to promote diversity in the student body to provide us with the greatest possible learning environment. It is our responsibility, however, to actively learn from peers of different cultures, nationalities or religions.
I treasure the things my Indian co-workers have taught me about Bollywood and cricket. I treasure the experiences I had traveling through China with a native Chinese student I met in class.
If groups in the majority intentionally work to create a welcoming environment, allowing minority groups to not feel awkward, we will open our campus culture to greater dissemination of ideas, points of view, cultural experiences and new relationships.
Embracing diversity is important to our personal development, our future in an increasingly globalized world and our general ability to relate to people different than ourselves.
It begins with our awareness of differences. It begins in the classroom by intentionally sitting with people different from ourselves, learning from them and befriending them.
A piece of advice from a graduating senior: Don’t let USC’s wealth of cultural differences go to waste.
Jensen Carlsen is a senior majoring in economics and mathematics. His column “The Bridge” ran Wednesdays.
It is so lame when people try to symbolically make the appearance that  we can mix races in a group. What is that proving? Sanctimonious liberals love to point this out like this is such a tragedy a white guy will not sit next to a black guy, Asian guy, Mexican, etc. WHO CARES??
I would be just happen if we are no longer shooting each other in this city because someone is a different color and someone thought they were being diss’d. 
Jensen, What color are all your friends – not just the ones you like to be seen with – I mean your actual REAL friends? Right I thought so – thank you for answering your own question why people gravitate  towards  people they think  they are more in common with.
Wow. A really nice article in DT. My experience has been the same as the authors’. I am an International student, I used to wonder why people never mixed on campus. I thought “Birds of the same feather, flock together”. This is a problem with LA. You never see USC students mixing with locals. They are always the others.
In my experience, students do mix when the assignments get tough. All you have to do is say Hi and you can make some friends. I still remember my Korean, Japanese and American friends from my first class at SC.
Things are usually better at on campus jobs.
No doubt, Ucla has no self segregation. There are just too many Asians there. Even in the sororities. Not as cute as USC though. Classes are full and ppl usually have no problem talking to each other.
awestruck, I came to SC to learn, not just make money. Now I am Trojan and can’t wait for the football season to start! Not all students are like what you say.
Hey Jensen, I honestly believe that USC culls international students for the sake of upping its prestige. The Ivies used to do this; but they no longer need to do it because the names “Harvard, Yale, Princeton” alone sell themselves. 
Anyways, yeah, a lot of these international students merely see USC as a stepping stone. They don’t see their experience here as a journey, but rather an expedient to get that degree so to make money. And in their countries, degrees from U.S. universities usually hold more weight, and will get you further career-wise.  It’s that flat, plain and simple. Sorry, I didn’t mean to disenchant you.
Hmm… you ADVOCATE for self-segregation and “identity politics” in the form of a black students’ association, gay students’ association, racially-segregated Greek houses, etc… and you wonder why your peers seem to be separating themselves? You can’t have it both ways. Racism (etc) will only go away when all of you banish it from your own worldview.
USC is a microcosim of the real world and the bottom line the lack of trust will inherently group one another with their constituents.  This has been going on for hundreds of years if not longer.  You are young and lack the worlds day to day expereice to unfortunately grasp this!  Give it time you too shall see the world in a more succinct fashion.
I applaud the writer’s suggestions and viewpoint. However, given Vice President of Student Affairs, Michael Jackson’s ham-handed message to Muslim students earlier this year; I find it difficult to believe that students who come from Islamic countries would be inclined to reach out to other non-Muslim students at University Park. Perhaps, as the saying goes, “The fish stinks from the head down.”

2010-04-28,USC,China,"The Good, the Bad, the Weird really moves. Oozing style from every frame, Kim Jee-woon’s Korean western starts with a thrilling train robbery in Japanese-occupied China and rarely slows down. Here is a film that understands the simple pleasure of a moving camera and moving characters.
Shootout · The Good, the Bad, the Weird uses 1930s Manchuria as a setting akin to the American West. - Photo courtesy of IFC Films 
Kim’s movie is an absurd, gorgeous mash-up of Western and Eastern iconography: deadeye Koreans in cowboy hats, Chinese ghost towns and a roaring Gatling gun.
Bounty hunter Du-won (Jung Woo-sung), “the Good,” forms an uneasy partnership with “the Weird,” Tae-goo (Song Kang-ho), an amoral bandit looking for a legendary Chinese treasure trove. “The Bad,” gang leader Chang-yi (Lee Byung-hun), seeks both the map to the treasure and revenge on Tae-goo.
Almost inevitably, the good character becomes lost against his more engaging counterparts. Byung-hun — tragically best known to Americans for his turn as evil ninja Storm Shadow in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra — plays Chang-yi over the top, with a vicious style to match his menacing and carefully put together hairdo. Dressed in black from head to toe and never without a cold sneer, Chang-yi epitomizes the tone and style of Kim’s movie: cool on a plane that most pastiche pieces never quite reach. The chubby, crazy-eyed Kang-ho, who has played variations of “the Weird” in films like Bong Joon-ho’s The Host or Park Chan-wook’s Thirst, steals his scenes with an effortlessness that has defined his career.
One thing to appreciate about Kim’s films compared to other Korean action movies is his almost-American obsession with the power of the gun. His excellent A Bittersweet Life riffed on the normally martial arts-based Korean gangster genre by letting its protagonist bring a gun to a knife fight. The Good, the Bad, the Weird takes his fetish to a further extreme, seriously challenging the classic Golan-Globus American action movies from the Reagan era for the “most bullets expended over 120 minutes” world record.
Kim calls The Good, the Bad, the Weird an “Oriental western,” an emerging subgenre pioneered by Asian directors with roots in Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood pictures. Takashi Miike made a truly bizarre take on Akira Kurosawa’s western-inspired Yojimbo in Sukiyaki Western Django, but where that film felt like homage without much new to say, Kim’s version really strives to reinvent the classically American genre with the sensibilities of a modern Korean action movie.
The Japanese occupation of Northern China in the ’30s is as close as East Asia gets to a Wild West. In focusing on Korean immigrants fighting Japanese soldiers, Chinese bandits and each other, The Good, the Bad, the Weird is ripe for political analysis, but Kim’s film is so stylized and frantic that it resists such readings.
Even just 80 years removed from that dark history, still very much an open wound on the collective East Asian psyche, Kim’s Manchuria feels like a mythic setting, a world as far removed from reality as the Texas-Mexico border in Leone or Sam Peckinpah’s films.
The production design deserves special mention — the film was made inexpensively by American standards but the worlds it creates through digital effects and traditional sets flow together almost seamlessly into a fantastic vision of a ’30s China that never existed.
Kim’s reference-heavy old-becomes-new style demands comparison to the last decade of Quentin Tarantino’s work; the director even uses Chingon’s “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” and some Ennio Morricone samples to the same effect Tarantino uses in his Kill Bill movies. Kim cares much less about dialogue than the often self-indulgent QT, and The Good, the Bad, the Weird feels much leaner than Tarantino’s bloated recent work.
Putting plot and character second to action finally catches up to Kim in a final showdown predicated on some poorly telegraphed plot twists, which carries less dramatic heft than it could otherwise, but the film earns a rare pass in putting style over substance.
The plot also sags terribly when it slows down even briefly, but while such pauses are necessary for any coherent action picture, Kim fails to handle them in an interesting manner.
As in his previous work, Kim’s senses as an action director are strangely flawed. The staging becomes so cluttered and the camera becomes so delirious with movement that scenes sometimes lose their sense of direction. A climactic desert chase featuring dozens of pursuers after the heroes runs so long and features so many changes of direction by the camera and characters that trying to follow it logically becomes an exercise in frustration.
But individual images from Kim’s relentless bombardment of action choreography stand out as better than their sum — try and find a cooler moment in any action movie this year than the rifle-bearing Du-won turning his horse around and riding into the pursuing Japanese army.

A group of USC students will soon be on their way to Shanghai for the long-awaited Shanghai World Expo 2010.
Beginning May 1, the expo is a chance for nations to display their impressive resources. It will host pavilions from countries around the world who will use the opportunity to present their most influential businesses and non-governmental organizations.
To prepare for the expo, the U.S. State Department decided to recruit students to represent the country and chose to ask the USC U.S.-China Institute to run the student program.
“Our selection is an indication of the global orientation of our university and the impact that the U.S.-China institute has made in its short history,” said Clayton Dube, the associate director of USC’s U.S.-China Institute. “We were a natural choice to be involved in the project.”
Students interested in becoming an ambassador had six weeks to apply, a process that included sending transcripts, letters of recommendation and an essay, and required students to have a minimum two years of Chinese language training. A national committee of evaluators considered all 599 qualified applications before selecting 160 ambassadors to attend the expo, some of whom are USC students.
Ying Jia Huang, a senior majoring in history, international relations and East Asian languages and cultures, said being an ambassador will be beneficial to her future.
“I plan to work in China for a couple years in the future and pursue graduate studies in international development, so serving as [a] U.S. student ambassador would be an insightful experience for me personally,” Huang said.
Student ambassadors will receive funds for airfare, housing and daily expenses, such as food and transportation. At the expo, students will have the opportunity to do various jobs at the U.S. pavilion, including working with government, NGO and business delegates.
“These responsibilities are heavy because most of the people the ambassadors will work with are VIPs,” Dube said.
For Huang, the most exciting thing will be experiencing many different cultures at all of the pavilions, especially China.
“At the expo, I will have the opportunity in meeting people from all walks of life, to experience firsthand the various microcosms of China’s growth,” Huang said.
The 2010 expo, promoting the theme “Better Life, Better City,” will emphasize discussion of urban issues that affect cities all over the world, such as migration, education, the environment, job creation and transportation. With a total budget of $45 billion, Shanghai was able to prepare itself sufficiently for the gathering. The city has constructed subway lines, bridges and an entire district to make room for the expo location.
The USC Thornton School of Music’s orchestra was invited to perform at the Shanghai Expo, but ultimately declined the invitation.
“The performance venue they are providing is much better for popular music concerts than a symphonic concert and we thought it would not feature the Thornton School, nor USC, in a very good light if we were to perform,” said Dean Robert Cutietta.
The Trojan Marching Band will be traveling to Shanghai to perform as part of the American performance. Multimedia will also be an important part of the expo. Conferences will be connected via satellite that link American activities to China so that an event held in the United States can be projected into the expo. These discussions will focus on anything, like issues about video gaming technology.
The United States was almost left out of the expo because sufficient funds could not be raised. Upon becoming Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton decided this was crucial for the country’s image. After receiving donations from 34 corporate sponsors, the U.S. finally committed to the event last summer.
“It would have been unimaginable for the United States to be just about the only country on Earth not to be represented in a global event of this size,” said U.S. commissioner general Jose H. Villarreal in a recent LA Times article.
Dube said the expo also represents a huge opportunity for China.
“The Shanghai Expo is really one of China’s great opportunities to demonstrate the enormous changes that have occurred there in recent decades and to show China as a major global center,” Dube said.

But starting the school year does not mean leaving behind memorable days. During the coming months, Los Angeles will continue to serve as a place to find new experiences — if now on the weekends.
Head over to the Chinatown Summer Nights, a program held every Saturday in August. Presented by various organizations — including the Chinese Historical Society of Southern California and the Los Angeles Chinatown Corporation — the event takes place at the West and Central Plazas of Chinatown, and, most importantly, admission is absolutely free.
The next two events — on Saturday, Aug. 21 and Aug. 28 — will run from 5 p.m. to midnight. Each Saturday has its own theme, and this coming Saturday’s is “harmony,” featuring family workshops and cooking demos. To meet the program’s growing popularity, each Saturday brings in various food trucks for attendees to sample until 10 p.m. or midnight — depending on the plaza. This Saturday will also feature a martial arts workshop and a set by KCRW DJ Jeremy Sole.
Aug. 28 closes out the event and focuses on the theme of “longevity.” The day will include the same workshops, and Latin dance instructor Laura Canellias will replace the martial arts display, for which KCRW DJ Aaron Byrd will supply music.
Patrons can also sample the many restaurants in the area, for which the Chinatown Summer Nights website offers a variety of discounts. For coupons, parking information and the event schedule, visit the official website at: www.chinatownsummernights.com.

We all have our own favorite dives in our city, neighborhood or town. That regional hot spot could be a non-franchised hole-in-the-wall that serves messy, sleeves-up grub or the jazzy new talk of the town, established by a celebrity chef and frequented by young hipsters.
Good eats - The Original Pantry Café located on Ninth and Figueroa streets was established more than 80 years ago. Currently, the historic restaurant offers its trademark culinary items 24 hours a day.  - James Watson | Daily Trojan 
Whichever it is, it’s the food and atmosphere that keep you coming back, and you remember it fondly whenever you leave home. It’s time to develop some new personalized local favorites, right here in Los Angeles.
Are you a breakfast lover who would tuck into eggs and bacon at midnight? Do you love the idea of pitch forking into a greasy mountain of food for minimal dollars? Consider camping at The Original Pantry Café, just a 10-minute drive from USC at Ninth and Figueroa streets and open 24 hours a day. Established in 1924, The Original Pantry has been serving up hot grub for more than 80 years, non-stop.
Don’t go looking for kohlrabi puree on gleaming china; the diner lives up to its name and only sells iconic, original greasy spoon fare such as crisp-fried bacon, omelets with processed cheese, fluffy griddle pancakes, basic French toast, golden hash, country fried steak and good ol’ American apple pie— accompanied by complimentary sourdough bread and vegetables in the form of creamy coleslaw.
Likewise, The Original Pantry still maintains the traditional diner modus operandi and has its menu chalked into the walls. If you’re by yourself, skip the long lines by getting a seat by the counter. Watch the cook grill your bread right in front of you — if you can handle watching the amount of oil they use. Leave the plastic at home, the Pantry only takes cash.
On the other end of the spectrum, perhaps you care about animal cruelty and keeping the doctor away. If you like your food clean, fresh and cooked with minimal suffering of animals and the Earth, then take a drive out to The Veggie Grill on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood.
The Veggie Grill is a vegan cafe serving high-organic, meat-free, dairy-free, trans fat-free, cholesterol-free food that, surprisingly, still manages to retain great flavor.
Give it a try before you start smirking at its Santa Fe Crispy Chickin’ burger and Chop-Chop Chef salad. The “meat” tastes surprisingly authentic, and the salads are vibrant and plucked-from-the-garden fresh. Since everything is practically guilt-free anyway, go ahead and indulge yourself with a batch of Sweetheart Fries, crisp and flavorful sweet potato fries served with a snazzy chipotle “ranch” or with a ladle of Bean Me Up Chili.
Another plus? Parking validation, affordable prices, warm service and Trader Joe’s right next door. This is one place you’ll leave feeling warm fuzzies for your health and moral conscience.
Of course, you cannot live in Los Angeles and miss its Latin cuisine. Expand your gastronomical geography in the Latin world and give some other regional tastes a whirl (Taco Bell does not count).
Seek out Salvadoran food from Sarita’s Pupuseria at the Downtown Grand Central Market on Broadway Street. Sarita’s specializes in homemade pupusas, a traditional Salvadoran thick pancake handmade from masa, or dough, and stuffed with your choice of meats, seafood, cheese, beans or vegetables before griddled to perfection in front of your eyes.
Don’t expect fawning waiters, though; the service is quick and brash, and if you get lucky, you might lean up against the counters to enjoy your hot pupusas with plenty of napkins and hot sauce. But that’s all part of the experience. And at just $2.40 each, you can spend the rest of your money shopping for cheap fruits, vegetables and dried goods at the other market stalls.
If you’re willing to break away from the usual burrito and nacho “Mexican” fare, you need not go far to try yet another interesting regional food of Mexico. Chichen Itza, a small restaurant on Grand Avenue squeezed into the Latin marketplace Mercado La Paloma, offers a unique Yucatan culinary experience with an exquisite blend of Mayan, Spanish and Lebanese influences. USC students are lucky to have this restaurant so close to campus, because authentic Yucatan cuisine is rare in Los Angeles.
Chichen Itza is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Don’t worry about the unfamiliar dish names — everything tastes good here. Despite the fact that none of the dishes cost more than $10, each is presented elegantly with bright colors and meticulous plating.
One popular dish is the Cochinita Pibil, pork marinated in a famous Yucatan spicy paste made of annato seed and called achiote, sour orange juice and spices, and then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked until tender and fragrant. Vegetarians can try the papadzules, a corn crepe stuffed with creamy boiled eggs, drenched with mellow ground pumpkin seed and epazote sauce then topped with a tangy tomato sauce for contrasting flavors and colors.
Each of these places have their own unique style of food and atmosphere. Los Angeles might be dotted with high-end, celebrated restaurants and generic fast food chains, but it is just as easy to find a middle ground: someplace low-key with good, affordable food and a warm, inviting ambience. It all depends on your own tastes, personality and preferences. Keep a curious mind and an open stomach, and you’ll be fast on your way to establishing your own personal local favorite in Los Angeles.

The USC Office of Admission has declared the class of 2014 the university’s best class to date.
Officials said the pool of students applying for college is growing more competitive each year, which — combined with USC’s active recruitment — molded the class of 2014.
“We have been moving the university’s academic profile consistently and getting more and more competitive,” said Tim Brunold, dean of admissions. “We have been able to successfully recruit the most sought after students in the country.”
The average SAT score for the class of 2014 increased 10 points, placing the average score in the 96th percentile.
“While the demographics of the [freshman] class are very similar [to previous years], the quality certainly continues to increase, and that is a long-term trend,” Brunold said.
Though the 24 percent acceptance rate is similar to last year, the size of the freshman class increased by about 100 students to 2,963.
Forty-six percent of the freshmen are male and 54 percent are female, which generally does not change from year to year, Brunold said.
“We’re not as out of balance for the freshman class as some of our competitors,” he said.
Yet, the gender statistic supports the national trend of more women attending college than men. Although this is of great concern, Brunold said, overall USC has almost an exact gender balance university-wide.
“We want to make sure that USC’s student body reflects the diversity out in the world,” Brunold said. “USC is continuing to work on increasing the diversity of students from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds and make strides in ethnic diversity.”
Typically, underrepresented racial groups increased their presence in the freshman class this year: 7.3 percent of students are African-American, which increased from 7 percent last year; and 13.3 percent of students are Latino, which increased from 12.8 percent.
Though there are about 300 freshmen students from outside the United States, the international population of the freshman class decreased from 11 percent to 10 percent this year. Of those students, 40 countries are represented, with most students originating from China, Canada and South Korea.
Demographic diversity within the United States is increasing, however, with most out-of-state freshmen students hailing from Texas, Illinois, New York and Washington. The class of 2014 represents 48 of the 50 states; no freshmen students hail from Mississippi or North Dakota.
As the out-of-state freshmen population increases, the percentage of incoming students who went to high school in California has steadily decreased over the past five years. This year, 52 percent of the class is from California.
The admission center plans to continue recruiting students by increasing its number of high school visits next year, Brunold said. Representatives from the Office of Admission visited 1,400 high schools while recruiting the class of 2014 — about a 50 percent increase from the previous year.
Though the statistics of the class of 2014 will not become official until the third week of classes, Brunold said the numbers are not expected to vary greatly.

USC’s increase in its number of international offices is starting to pay off. Not only has the number of Chinese student undergraduates grown at this university, but the nation has also felt the surge. In just five years, the number of Chinese undergraduates attending U.S. universities has grown nearly 60 percent, although this influx might be the result of professional sports-like marketing.
A new report by InsideHigherEd.com found that agents are often used to bring international students to U.S. universities, operating as a middleman between the student and the university. Much like the relationship between an athlete about to enter a professional league and his agent, these middlemen work on commission to promote the best possible “client.”
The report discussed a survey among four U.S. schools — Grinnell College, Iowa State, Fort Hays State and USC — and five Chinese high schools; more than 60 percent of the polled high school students said they planned to use such agents, whereas 50 percent of Chinese college students said they had used them.
Agents have “raised educators concerns” according to a USC report as the agent’s fees are usually collected by from both the student and the institution, and the results are tangible. In the 2004-2005 school year, about 8,300 students from China enrolled in American universities. Today that number is close to 30,000.

Do it yourself · The 10th annual Portland Zine Symposium — held last weekend at Portland State University — is a free conference and social gathering for zinesters, small press and other DIY items. - Sarah Bennett | Daily Trojan 
For two days this past weekend, Portland State University in Downtown Portland hosted the 10th annual Portland Zine Symposium, a free conference dedicated to all things independent publishing, small press and provocative thought.
With newspapers scaling back staff writers, magazines pandering to their advertisers and independent weeklies shutting down city-wide, today’s zine community is giving hope to the printed word by creating niche-based publications for open-minded leftists, reminding us that if you want something to get done, you’re going to have to do it yourself.
First thing’s first: What is a “zine?”
“Zine” is short for “magazine” and was first used in reference to the multitude of small-run fan magazines (aka fanzines) that emerged with the first science fiction films in the 1940s. National magazines had no interest in the still-underground alien-and-monster market, so sci-fi lovers began self-producing their own as a way to distribute news and fan-fictions.
The spirit of handmade, limited-run, photocopied sci-fi fanzines was soon appropriated by other ignored-by-the-mainstream groups looking for ways to share their information, but the subversive concept also has roots in art manifestos, revolutionary literature and beat poetry chapbooks. A surge in independent publishing came with the underground press of the 1960s and continued through the ’70s and ’80s with punk zines created as a way to both localize the genre and to open it up to those outside of the immediate area.
This nurturing power of independent press has been used by all types of underground communities from early gay rights group Mattachine Society to feminist punks as part of the 1990s’ Riot Grrrl movement.
Traditionally half-letter size and spine-stapled straight out of a black-and-white photocopy machine, zines were originally made to be cheap and portable — essentials for maximum message dissemination. Today, however, zines are a catch-all term used to describe a variety of low-circulation, special-interest periodicals produced independently of major publishing houses. Self-publishing comes in handy for everyone from political radicals to cutesy cartoonists, and with the expansion of equally-as-indie distribution services (aka distros), the medium has seen a resurgence in recent years. Final products can range in size from matchbook to folio, and with a range of crafty accents — such as specialty paper, unique printing methods and hand-sewn bindings — many now blur the line between artwork and publication.
Every possible variance on the empowerment medium was on display at Portland’s Zine Symposium, an annual festival that showcases not only zinesters (as people who make zines call themselves), but also the city of Portland, itself an epicenter of the zine subculture.
To say that Portland is supportive of zine-makers is an understatement. In addition to hosting the longest-running zine festival in the world, Portland is known for its zine-specific bookstores, zine libraries (the largest of which is part of the Multnomah County public library system), and — most importantly — the Independent Publishing Resource Center.
The IPRC is unlike anything else in the country. A nonprofit, it spearheads the organization of the Portland Zine Symposium but is best known for its invaluable community space located in a modest office building in Portland’s Silverlake-esque Pearl District. Full of resources for artists and writers interested in making their own publications, the IPRC is thanked in the liner notes for many of Portland’s hometown zines. With a Mac-filled computer lab, a photocopy machine, a letterpress studio, a craft room, a bookbinding machine and its own expansive zine library, the IPRC is a collaborative environment that accepts anyone who walks through the door.
Free of judgment or elitist attitudes — and with a calendar stacked full of workshops, classes, contests and engaging events — the IPRC fosters organic creativity within the city’s self-publishers and could serve as a model for other towns looking to embrace their potential zinesters.
Like Los Angeles, for instance.
In a city so consumed with marketable media, it’s only logical that the zine scene would be lacking. But when the only other three people brave enough to trek from Los Angeles to the PZS didn’t even know of each other’s existence, the community factor clearly needs help.
No person should be on a self-publishing island, especially in Los Angeles, which has a burgeoning DIY music and art scene of its own, yet two of the other three in attendance didn’t even know there were independent bookstores that would buy their stuff.
Though Los Angeles did have a citywide zine fest once upon a time (2003’s appropriately-titled L.A. Zine Fiesta), it was a combination craft fair and the zine community has since subsisted on super*MARKET, a small-yet-flourishing swap meet-type concert-event held at Meltdown Comics in Hollywood.
The future of zines in Los Angeles is bright, however ­— we have all the ingredients for a flourishing community. First, we have plenty of zines. There are enough artists, writers and DIY people in this city to stock its own zine library. Plus, there are independent bookstores such as Stories in Echo Park, Meltdown Comics in Hollywood and Ooga Booga in Chinatown that offer brick and mortar outlets for small-press publications and local distros. Websites Only For the Open Minded and False Start already sell many art and comic zines online.
Taking cues from Portland, though, Los Angeles could use some glue, a large-scale annual event or a neighborhood center such as IPRC to bind together and motivate all of the city’s disparate creatives. Even though there are 19 people registered on Los Angeles’ “We Make Zines” Ning.com account, a consistent, in-person gathering for social networking should be established where zine-making veterans can share knowledge through panel discussions and first-time self-publishers can attend workshops and learn hands-on skills.
It was sad to hear, but from Venice to Hollywood to Long Beach, the zinesters that showed up at the PZS all said they felt disconnected from resources for their craft.
True, isolation is a common complaint in this city, but it still shouldn’t have taken us a 1,000-mile drive to find each other.

For those souls who have long wondered where to find silk screening stands, vegan entrees, vintage clothing vendors and enough indie bands to make the editors of Pitchfork wet themselves in one place, get thee to Los Angeles State Historic Park this weekend. The Seventh edition of FYF Fest kicks off at noon on Saturday. And with a stacked bill headlined by Panda Bear and The Rapture, it will likely go down as the festival’s most opulent outing yet.

Before its growth in numbers and prestige necessitated some unfortunate title censorship, the festival was described by its promoters as “a mixtape of bands that would never play with one another but go so well together.”
It would be easy to deride the blatant hipsterisms of the event if it were not such a bargain. For $30, the rough price of a 3-D movie for two at L.A. Live, attendees of FYF Fest will be treated to 12 hours of art installations, record swap meets with dozens of participating stores, a cornucopia of ethnic food trucks and beer gardens and, of course, 37 bands that could normally be found playing anywhere from the Echoplex to Creamfields.
Closing the Oak Stage will be Animal Collective’s founding member Noah Lennox, known by his stage name Panda Bear, playing his first Los Angeles show since 2007. Panda Bear’s set will likely draw heavily from his masterfully melodic, Person Pitch, as well as his lesser known early material and perhaps a new song or two. In any event, the opportunity to hear the cryptic, Beach Boys-inspired epic “Bros” live should be enough to send thousands clamoring to the show.
Another serious grab for the festival is Spanish dance-rock outfit Delorean. Fresh off the release of its luminous new album Subiza (an arguable candidate for the best summer album of 2010), the four-man band plays with the pulse of any club act, but it is its beautiful air piano interludes, vocal layering and tonal range that allows the band to shoot beyond the artistic heights reached by Passion Pit and similar groups.
Those looking for a calmer form of transcendence cannot afford to miss School of Seven Bells. Last seen opening for M83 and Bat for Lashes, the New York trio, fronted by heavenly voiced twin sisters Alejandra and Claudia Deheza, sits somewhere between high concept shoegaze and frigid dream, and the result is a heartbreakingly gorgeous collection of tremolo heavy sound-scapes that would likely put a smile on Kevin Shields’ face.
As for local talents, the festival lineup will feature Dead Man’s Bones, the new folk project of actor Ryan Gosling, friend Zach Shields and the Silverlake Conservatory Children’s Choir (founded by Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea). With a penchant for moody venues, including cemeteries, Gosling and company will share their eerie yet romantic compositions of supernatural sounds with those open to its unique, unsettling quality.
Rounding off the day are numerous bands that have paid their dues at The Smell and other underground venues. Chino tropical punk quartet Abe Vigoda will unleash its frenetic guitars in the afternoon before heading off to Europe with No Age. Lo-fi poster boy Wavves will unveil new material after his disastrous Barcelona Primavera appearance and subsequent rehab stint. Silverlake rock darlings Local Natives, a late addition to the lineup, will also be featured in a late afternoon slot.
FYF Fest founder Sean Carlson, at a mere 25 years old, has described the festival as an aspiration of resurrecting his earlier days of seeing acts such as Murder City Devils in warehouses and other unusual, unregulated locales.
While FYF will usher in more fans than any venues could have contained, the festival still feels like a miracle in its survival and growth. Whether it can retain it’s proudly indie vibe amid its ballooning in size and attractions (a challenge met unconvincingly by Coachella earlier this year) remains to be seen, but for now Carlson’s creation should make for a thrilling way to spend a Saturday afternoon.
FYF Festival will open its doors at noon on Saturday, with tickets available online for $30, which will be placed on will call at the entrance. For those looking to reduce their carbon footprint for a day, the park is easily accessible by taking the Metro Gold Line to the Chinatown Station. The shebang officially wraps at midnight, but don’t be surprised if the after parties rage into the early hours.

Today, President Barack Obama is speaking at the Western Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland, where he is expected to unveil a series of proposals designed to kick-start economic growth. Among them is this request to Congress: that it permanently extend a $100-billion research and development tax credit and a $50-billion infrastructure push that would create temporary employment and rebuild roads, airstrips and railways.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
Proposals like Obama’s are exactly the right type of government intervention in the current economy and are reminiscent of common policies in high-growth environments such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. Unfortunately, it seems the White House has caught on too late — it has only three more months to pass such legislation.
Republicans are expected to make massive gains in November’s midterm elections, after which they will likely block many Democratic initiatives. Republican leaders have been campaigning on the Democrats’ mishandling of the economy, but have been generally mute on what exact steps should be taken. Instead of taking a proactive approach, they will likely use their new strength in Congress to thwart governmental action in the economy to increase the Republican presidential candidate’s chances in 2012.
This obstructionist stance is in no way limited to Republicans. Instead, it is a structural characteristic of the opposition in American politics. Democrats behaved in a similar manner throughout the George W. Bush years and reaped the rewards in 2008. It is hypocritical of them to lament that Republicans might capitalize with the same tactic.
This is a permanent flaw in the American political system. Congress is powerful enough to block the executive’s agenda at will, and the constant campaigning that representatives must undertake because of biannual elections leads them to use that power to negative ends. Although solid policymaking requires a certain distance from the helter-skelter world of the 24-hour news cycle, legislators are forced to become populist screamers if they are to have a legitimate chance at job security.
In his book, From Wealth to Power, Fareed Zakaria (editor-at-large of Time magazine) used a case study of the United States from 1865 to 1908 to demonstrate the importance of executive supremacy over the legislature in a country’s ability to project power internationally. This was because of Congress’ reluctance to approve spending that would be unlikely to increase incumbents’ chances of re-election.
In the age of CNN, Rush Limbaugh and the blogosphere, the types of legislation that can pass Congress are restricted even further. Therefore, executive supremacy is not only a key to a state’s foreign policy power, but also its ability to effect economic and social change.
At the same time, the increasing ability of individual and particularly extreme fringe voices to influence the political environment seems to have created a shift away from executive supremacy. The increasing difficulty to pass legislation has made U.S. policy overly complicated and ineffective.
An example of this phenomenon can be seen in the health care bill passed earlier this year. That bill was 2,409 pages. The Social Security Act of 1935 was 64. The Constitution was four.
The bill ran as long as it did because as the administration tried to win over Congress, each compromise required more concessions. Unfortunately, though providing insurance to every American was an impressive achievement, the complications brought on by any 2,409-page piece of legislation are likely to overwhelm the benefits. Health care needed to be extended and simplified. Unfortunately, congressional obstructionism mandated that Obama choose one or the other.
This type of debacle can be contrasted with states that have strong executives. China is, of course, one example of this. The communist party’s grip on power has allowed decision-making to proceed extremely smoothly there for the past 20 years, facilitating astonishing growth rates. Clearly, China also demonstrates the flipside of the American dilemma — too much executive power leads to repression, a lack of human rights, and a lack of social and political expression.
A middle ground is still possible. Countries such as Brazil and England demonstrate that respect for human rights and public opinion can be maintained even when the executive branch has the power to pass smart and simple policies.
In 2008, Obama seemed to have the potential to move the United States closer to this more optimal balance of power between branches of government. Unfortunately, he seems to have neglected this duty and after the next elections, he will likely wish that he had not.

And one more thought… (I like multiple posts LOL)… Brookings describes itself as non-partisan (not bipartisan, Jonny), but even Time, the NYT and the LA Times have described it as liberal or left-leaning. Know your sources. 
As for “working out what is in the bill” that should have been done before it was passed, no? Like Obama promised, it should have been out there for everyone to dissect before they rammed it through, no? What were they afraid of?
Finally, that figure of 40 million uninsured is suspect. Our health care system was not broken; it was not perfect. Without repeal, it will certainly be worse now.
Also, I fail to see how calling Glenn Beck a “whack job” contributes to the discussion. He has an excellent grasp of history and some strong viewpoints that again, align with a majority of Americans. Your venom buys us nothing.
Jonny, there’s a reason there’s a big push for repeal of Obamacare. It is an unprecedented power grab by the federal government involving both intrusion into your personal liberties and (as has been increasingly admitted by the Democrats) soaring costs THAT OUR COUNTRY CAN’T AFFORD. Even if it was the best plan in the world, we can’t afford it, and so it’s out of the question. The fact that some Republicans agreed with it only shows why many of those same Republicans are also being voted out of office (as some already have been via the primaries).
But Bob Dole wanted Republicans to back Obamacare. One of the ladies from Maine voted to get it out of committee. Why not try working out what is in the Bill, rather than rely on what whack-jobs like Glenn Beck tell you. Check out the bipartisan Brookings Institution’s Healthcare 101. Obamacare is about insuring more than 40 million people who were without health insurance (in the richest country in the world), trying to start to get a handle on health care cost inflation (see the OMB’s chart on projected costs under the old system), and providing some subsidies (by taxing unneccesarily subsidized Cadillac Plans- where he took on the unions) so that people could afford the plan. The old system was broken- check the WHO’s league tables on health systems.
Oh and for the record — not wanting our government to be like China’s — thinking we need fewer laws/less regulation — and just saying no to Obamacare… these are not “far right.” These are in the absolute mainstream of American opinion, my friend. It is the leftist namecallers like yourself who are on the far fringe… so far out, you apparently can’t see clearly.
Steve, what are you doing here being hateful by calling my legitimate comments “hate”? That’s so LEFT of you… presenting no arguments, relying on namecalling.
Why is Diane also on here spewing her far-right hate? Has she not got better things to do with her time?
I remain astonished by Daniel Charnoff’s naivete. 
First, the checks and balances are there for a reason. You are blaming THEM for a 2500 page healthcare bill? Or are you blaming the Republicans? Why not just blame Bush? What a crock of crap. Daniel, do you not understand that MOST Americans do not support the healthcare bill? That’s why Republicans (and some Democrats) kept saying “no.” Not to be “obstructionist” — BUT TO PREVENT BAD LAW. It’s not 2500 pages because of the Republicans — it’s 2500 pages because the number of pages of a bill is directly proportional to how bad it is. And, methinks the Dems were trying to hide some s**t in there, too.
It’s terribly amusing that the first “strong executive” you point to is in China. I know, you went on to use England as an example, but England is of course far closer to our system than is China’s. Again, I find it sad that I must point this out to an “international relations” major, but we don’t want a “strong executive like in China” who can make law. That’s not his job, son. Have you that little appreciation for the amazing system of government that has served us so well in this country? Do international relations majors spend no time on that? That, too, is very sad. And if the “age of CNN and Rush Limbaugh” keeps everyone accountable — Daniel, that’s a really good thing. Or do you think it’s better if everything happens under the radar? How naive is that?
Finally, you have an outright howler of a lie in this article. Republicans have not been generally mute on how to fix things. Numerous proposals and plenty of ideas are out there (ever listen to Rush? He’s offered a forum for quite a few ideas) — you, my young would-be policymaker, are not listening. From the “progressive” drivel you publish, I deduce that you don’t care to listen. Ironically, it’s all about stopping spending — which brings us back to why Republicans say “no.” Generally, we don’t need more laws. We need less.

You might not be aware, dear reader, but we are in the midst of a good ol’ knock out of a movie year. Not since 2007 — the year of There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men and Juno — has the silver screen shone so bright.
Yes, there was something magical in the air that year, something tangible that reached out and shook a certain high school junior marooned in the suburban hypocrisy of rural Georgia. It reached out and grabbed me and made me look, not just at the screen, but at myself.
Simply put, the films of that year inspired me. They told the stories I wanted to tell and showed me the way to tell them. This is purely subjective of course, but how can one explain what inspires him? Art simply does or it doesn’t. Quality of craftsmanship doesn’t enter into it.
And now, in 2010, we have another year of films that have made me look beyond myself. Another round of films by filmmakers who tinted the prism through which I view life. I can’t tell you why or how they did this — I don’t have the skills to put it into words. All I can do is tell you what they are and hope you experience them for yourself. Hopefully you are as moved as I was.
The American
Who said Good Night, and Good Luck was gorgeous George’s coup d’état? Bull-pucky. When future cinephiles look back upon Clooney’s career, they will point to The American as his greatest triumph. Best crime drama of the year? Forget that. Make it the decade. Any decade. It makes Ben Affleck’s The Town look like a cutesy Hollywood knockoff of which Martin Scorsese would be proud.
This is a focused, complex character drama that builds rigorously and deliberately toward its stunning and emotionally gripping climax. Clooney plays an assassin whose life of cold-hearted, sinful self-denial has finally caught up with him. When he meets a beautiful Italian prostitute (played by the stunning Violante Placido), his desire for life, beauty and joy that overwhelms him, and he wants out. But, as we all know, it’s never that easy.
Clooney’s performance is transcendent. The best I’ve seen in years. He embodies a man overcome by the basest of emotions, all hidden beneath an exterior as cool, fine and transparent as a thin film of ice on a warm winter’s day. Such complexity hasn’t been seen since Daniel Day-Lewis plied his wares for P.T. Andersen as Daniel Plainview. Give the pretty boy his Oscar. He deserves it.
The Town
Did I just call this a cutesy Hollywood knock off?
Don’t listen to those who compare The Town to The Departed. They have the I.Q. of a rotting eggplant. The Departed should be compared to The Town.
The Town is better, and it’s not even a close contest. Unlike The Departed, which could be set in any city of the globe, The Town is about Boston crime. Beantown. It’s an exposé on urban crime, about how a city shapes and molds those very people whose actions destroy it.
The Town is about a way of life, a culture, and it preaches its message through a well-honed plot of strong-armed robbery. It’s not as solid as The American, its view of life not so crystallized. Too often it wanders into the realm of Hollywood blockbuster, but nonetheless it solidifies Affleck as one of the most interesting directors working today.
He follows up on the debut success of Gone Baby Gone with a film that is superior. In Boston, he has found his muse. I hope he stays there. If does, I expect great things from Affleck, and I think The Town only hints at things to come.
Ondine
Never seen it? Never heard of it? I don’t blame you, dear reader. I blame the heathen distributors who have railroaded Neil Jordan’s masterpiece.
And what a masterpiece it is, a fantasy about a down-and-out Irish fisherman (Colin Farrell) who one day reels in a young girl whom he believes to be a mermaid. Of course her appearance is met with suspicion, but after the fisherman’s luck begins to change and he is reunited with his young daughter (the beautiful and precocious Alison Barry), he begins to believe in the fantasy. And so does the audience.
Normally I detest fantasy. I have no use for it. But the tenderness with which Jordan treats his subjects draws you in, making you let down your guard and, most importantly, want to believe in the myth. I cannot tell you how rare an experience that is in the world of cynical dramas. Jordan has given us a jewel of film, and we should be thankful.
The Ghost Writer
Let me tell you how good Roman Polanski is. Although The Ghost Writer is one of his weaker films, I still think it is one of the best in one of the strongest years for film in recent memory. Too bad his personal life overshadows the fact that he is one of the greatest cinematic talents of the 20th century.
The Ghost Writer doesn’t mark the return of classic Polanski. Nothing will touch the triumphs of Knife in the Water, The Tenant, or Chinatown; but it is an extremely well-executed thriller with a sparkling cast.
Ewan McGregor enjoys a steady turn as the Ghost, a journalist brought on to complete former Prime Minister Adam Lang’s (Pierce Brosnan) memoirs after the first ghostwriter turns up dead. Inevitably, the Ghost finds himself entwined in a tangled web of lies, deceit and power-lust.
Predictable stuff, but Polanski’s steady and reliable hand guides The Ghost Writer to the No. 4 spot on this list, thumping Scorsese’s mediocre Shutter Island which was released the same weekend. Unlike Scorsese, Polanski does not forget his Modernist roots, remembering that in order to create suspense, one must hold a shot longer than three seconds.* Thrillers are not music videos. Scorsese would do well to remember that. Polanski imbues his film with a stark, barren beauty that is wonderful to behold.
*I am not exaggerating. At one point I actually whipped out my stopwatch. For 15 minutes, Scorsese didn’t hold a shot for more than three seconds.
Easy A
Finally, we arrive at the fluff, the cotton candy if you will. And boy is it sweet. Emma Stone is delectable as Olive Penderghast, an obscure high school student who rises to prominence by becoming the school hussy.
Easy A is easy viewing (pardon the pun), featuring snapdragon, pulp-culture laden dialogue the likes of which haven’t been seen since Juno. Unlike the first four films which leave you somewhere between stunned and introspective, Easy A is a shot of adrenaline that leaves you feeling giddy as soon as the credits roll.
So far 2010 has given us three thrillers, a fantasy/drama and a comedy of superlative quality. Together, I would pit them against the top five of almost any other year. I do so because each of them tells a story from a perspective that is both new and unique — and that’s what makes them special. To me, the characters are real. They speak to me. I care what happens to them.
You know, I thought it was a mistake when the Academy expanded the Best Picture nominees to 10. Now, I’m thinking that might be just about right.

Congress recently had a sliver of an opportunity to drastically improve the shoddy U.S. immigration policy, which has been languishing in one form or another after decades of border fence bluster and vigilante vitriol.
But once again, politicking got in the way of reform.
Sullivan Brown | Daily Trojan
The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act (formerly titled the Unnecessarily Cutesy Acronym Act) was one of several amendments tacked on to a defense spending bill that the Senate voted on Tuesday. The bill, which also included a repeal of the controversial “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy in its sidecar, was trumped in a 56-43 vote in which every Republican (and two Democrats) sided “nay.” The defeat will hamper the Dream Act’s chances of seeing legislation until after the November midterm elections — if ever.
The act is aimed at an especially vulnerable block of illegal immigrants: children who immigrated with their parents at a young age and who have spent most of their lives in the United States. Its provisions would offer citizenship to young adults who have been in the country for more than five years, arrived before the age of 16 and have graduated from a U.S. high school, provided they commit to two years of university education or military service.
Because of the stringent guidelines, the Dream Act had the potential to be the buffer for future immigration reform; it targets those who have lived most of their lives in the United States and sidesteps the polarizing criticism of back door amnesty by enforcing a rigorous career outline on its candidates.
Most importantly, the act poses a concrete solution for the yet-unsolved problem of how to accommodate undocumented immigrants in the higher education system.
For this demographic, straddling the cultural divide is all the more tricky. Assimilation is no longer the problem — advancement is.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that illegal immigrants are entitled to free education from elementary through high school — a ruling that paved the way for future reform but created a glut of educated, successful high school graduates with nowhere to take their degrees.
These estimated 65,000 high school graduates a year (according to U.S. News & World Report) are stuck in limbo, awaiting further legislation, avoiding arrest, treading water.
Both Democrats and Repub-licans can be accused of parrying politics on the defense bill; Democrats tacked two very contentious (and disparate) amendments onto a seemingly unrelated bill, and Republicans responded with a filibuster that effectively put the kibosh on the bill and all its accoutrements.
Congress buried its chance to effect real change in all its machinations, but the Dream Act isn’t defunct yet — in fact, the day after the vote, it was reintroduced by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) If it has any chance of seeing fruition after midterms, both sides of Congress will have to stop finagling for political points.
The Dream Act won’t solve the huge, structural problems of illegal immigration in the United States, but it’s also more than a Band-Aid improvement — a border fence, an extra minute man. Its success could open the door for more improvements to the system as a whole, and more sweeping changes.
Illegal immigration is a controversial issue in the United States, but also a human one — one that we can’t simply shove out the back door.

I believe all DREAMERS should be able to go to college if they want and qualify.  The American taxpayer should not pay for it with Grants, Loans or Work Study.  These DREAMERS should be charged the same rate as foreign students.   Perhaps La Raza, the Hispanic groups, Univision etc could form a scholarship group for them. 
While the DREAMERS are studying they should learn the language of the country they came from so they can compete there.  After graduation they can them return to their country of origin and work on becoming productive citizens while helping their countries become successful in the world market place.
To contribute another perspective, below is a statement drafted by a coalition of organizations which oppose the Act.

————————————————————-
The Dream Act is a proposed piece of legislation that on the surface looks  like an educational bill for the legalization of undocumented youth, but is  actually a recruitment tool to fill the ranks of the military with this same youth.  The Dream Act says that if a young person graduates from a U.S. high school,  then s/he can get on a path towards some type of legalization if: s/he  completes at least 2 years of college towards a degree or does 2 years of military  service (in reality military contracts are 8 years.) Let’s analyze the reality.
The overwhelming majority of undocumented people, approximately 70 %, are Latinos. Out of approximately 12 million undocumented people in the U.S.,  over 7 million are Mexican and over 1 million are Central American. The sad  reality is that only about ¼ of Latino/as have ever attended college and only 11% of Latinos/as have a college degree. These are statistics for Latino/a  population not considering immigration status. La Raza Educators has provided more  specific statistics that suggests that only 1 out of 20 undocumented high school  seniors attend college. Since two years of college is needed to fulfill the  educational part of the Dream Act, it is likely that an overwhelming majority of undocumented youth will be pushed into the military in order to get a conditional green card. There is a long list of inequalities that make it  hard for immigrant youth to go to college. This bill does not address these  inequalities or the educational needs of undocumented youth but it addresses the needs  of the U.S. military, filling their ranks.
The heavy militarization aspect of the Dream Act became clear when two  important parts of the DREAM Act were removed. In an old version of the Dream Act,  910 hours of community service was one of the options to fulfill the  requirement for “legalization”. This option was taken away, as was the right to pay  in-state tuition. Because these two options are gone, more youth will see the  military as their only option.
This is exactly what the government is interested in. Senator Dick Durbin, sponsor of the DREAM Act, has said: “The DREAM Act would address a very  serious recruitment crisis that faces our military. Under the DREAM Act, tens of thousands of well-qualified potential recruits would become eligible for military service for the first time.” The military needs more recruits.  The politicians’ solution is to draft the undocumented.
We cannot be willing to sacrifice the lives of so many youth for the  benefit of so few. We should not support legislation that facilitates the recruitment  of youth to go off to war.
CAMI, Comite Anti-Militarizacion, supports higher education for all  students both documented and undocumented, however, we denounce the military  component of the DREAM ACT. Unfortunately, this deadly component is strategically  excluded from the debate by many Democrats and organizations who support the DREAM  ACT.
In essence, the DREAM ACT will create a defacto military draft for our undocumented youth. We say defacto because although students are given a “choice”, the fact is that the deplorable and inadequate conditions of  Latino schooling will make military enlistment the only “choice” for the  overwhelming majority of our undocumented youth. At the present time, it is against the  law to recruit undocumented youth into the US military, but with the passage  of the DREAM ACT, the recruiters will then be legally able to recruit our youth.
Historically racism and discrimination at home and in the military have adversely affected Latino youth who enter the military. During the Vietnam  War, Chicano and other Latino youth were sent to the frontlines in  disproportionate numbers. While Chicanos and Latinos were only 4.5 percent of the U.S. population, they were 19 percent of the casualties, some 80,000 Latinos  served during the Vietnam War.
With this reality, we pose the question: where will those students end up?  Dead on the battlefield in Iraq or Afghanistan? Will they join the 6,000 troops currently occupying the U.S./Mexico border? As the US continues to invade  and/or intervene in other countries, will our youth be forced to kill other poor  people in places like Venezuela, Columbia, Iran and Cuba?
We in CAMI do not wish to antagonize or minimize the efforts of the honest  youth and others who advocate for the Dream Act on behalf of undocumented  students. We wish to challenge all organizations that support the DREAM ACT to join us  in the struggle for the legalization of all students and our entire community. We  are all brothers and sisters in this struggle, but we must never negotiate the future of our youth in exchange for the legalization of a few of our  students.
We believe that our students and community deserve full and immediate legalization without having to serve in the military.
and yogurtland is open at gateway!!
One thing that seems to be overlooked in all the discussions of the DREAM act is that military service is already a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  So the 2 years of college “requirement” is really the big thing being changed,  and unlike military service, where the immigrant is putting something of him- or herself into the citizenship equation, the 2 years of college “requirement” means the immigrant is taking another huge taxpayer subsidized benefit. Please. Let the imnmigrant prove him- or herself by giving, rather than taking.
what army in there right mind would want someone in it that has already proved they are a trader they snuck out on there own country in the middle of the night because the new country had better stuff what if we were at war with a country that had better stuff then us would they start dreaming again and sneak over to the other side and get all our loyal soldiers killed didn’t we learn any thing from the fort hood massacre
I could not agree more with Francis on this one!!! I could not have said it any better.
This article is tastelessly biased, but I guess that is why it is in the “Opinions” section.
LEAST WE FORGET IN NOVEMBER
 Let us make it very clear that anti-illegal immigration groups–the majority of them are not racist. The Tea Party is certainly–NOT–racists, as one can see in the mix of demonstrations; it’s composed of everybody who believes in the “Rule of Law.” Which doesn’t mean just white people? In the 1986 an Amnesty was proposed in Congress by the late Ted Kennedy, who promised implicitly–NO–MORE—AMNESTIES prior to being enacted. Since just the 1990’s there have been six small amnesties, under the radar, hoping that the general public didn’t realize it? Senator Harry Reid, speaker Pelosi and the mob of pro amnesty politicians, thinks the American people are stupid when attaching an immigration rider to the the War appropriations bill ten days ago. The Dream Act (The Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act) had a limit under the house bill, but there are—NO- restrictions under Senator Reid, Dick Durbin who said nothing about people being able to be processed up to the age of 35, as being considered for citizenship under the Dream Act.  
My guess the majority of either parties, didn’t read the Dream Act attachment? By the time it would be passed, somewhere between 2 to 4 million students of illegal alien Mothers would be involved. The quality of high school performance didn’t seem to be a pre-requisite? It would be a grand award for parents who fraudulently moved to the United States. One thing Reid didn’t mention at all are those students legalized over 21 could sponsor their parents and immediate family circle. In addition even up to the age of fifteen you could still claim a visa under the Dream Act, even if you had just slid through the border. Senator Reid and top leadership cannot be trusted, as they will do anything to attract votes from the illegal minority population. Any promised Amnesty will attract people who didn’t even think of leaving there home country, until they heard that the generous American politicians were implementing another green card rush.   
We must be on our guard, as senator Reid may try to slip this law into the Senate once again, before November. Use the empowerment of your vote to demand that your US Senator does not vote for this Sen. Reid Dream Act by calling the Washington switchboard at 202-224-3121. The Public servants we voted into power, doesn’t seem to exhibit any compassion for the 15 American workers out of work. This week– a charade of summoning a comedian Stephen Colbert to Washington, to promote a path to citizenship for farm workers was madness and with better things to discuss? I think the whole situation was a prime embarrassment to all citizens. What did they hope to accomplish? If American non-skilled labor was paid wages they could live on, using more new generation machines to do the work of fifty, they would get more citizens hired?   
My grandfather picked grapes before the Second World War and his two boys also helped out during the harvesting season in the hot sun. One thing none of should forget that the farmers do not pay for the health care treatment and the farm workers children’s education, the US taxpayer does. Then while there here picking our fruit, vegetables any child born becomes an instant citizen. Females with multiple births can then claim citizenship for their infants and collect a whole lot of welfare benefits. This part of the 14th amendment has become a very expensive proposition for taxpayers. While citizens wait years to get on a list for low income housing, our government supply housing under section 8, food stamps, health care and a generous supply of welfare cash for each child. According to Pew Research Center there are approximately 8.5 million foreign nationals in jobs, citizens and legal residents should occupy.   
The only way we can ever take back America, for the people is sending a resonant message to Congress that we mean–BUSINESS! NO MORE AMNESTIES! We must dismantle the old boy political power network, starting with the removal of—ALL– incumbents. If you want to pay fewer taxes–we need to remove Sen. Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, Janet Napolitano, Sen. Barbara Boxer and a list of incumbents on both sides of the aisle in Washington. Keep an eye on Senator Reid as he stealthily nearly tabled E-Verify and has been singularly involved in blocking the 287 (g) local police illegal alien detainment and other immigration power plays. Outside of the main corruption in the Capitol, state assemblies are out to build a nest egg for themselves. That’s why we need to view carefully the Governors, Mayors and other elected officials who are supposedly representing us and should be under the gun. Finally–it’s a repeat performance that if we vote in the same old lot, nothing will change. 
There needs to be a contract with all new candidates, of no more “earmarks.” These things are in most cases taxpayer money, which is squandered on many incomprehensible projects. In November be assured that unknown numbers of illegal aliens will try and keep their pro-amnesty endorser in power, so all States with low security in polling stations should be scrutinized. The absentee ballot is specifically easy to forge without officials addressing this situation. As I said previously, the “honor System” cannot be trusted as today we must demand government picture ID to prove you are a citizen and have a right to vote—not just a utility bill.
 Texas and every other state needs to upgrade there security when it comes to voting, for as early the early seventies? Acorn, was involved in the a voter fraud controversy, but was batten down and seemed to have died out. High population of majority ethnic communities have been caught in undermining our voting system. for those citizens interested should GOOGLE–voter fraud and illegal immigrants. The Liberal press will suppress any articles about voter fraud, but their is a mass of evidence that this goes on around the country.
Grade cards for incumbents on immigration can be evaluated at NumbersUSA. $113 Billion a year says (FAIR) along with another $60 billion out the country, to foreign families. Nobody believes the lawmakers any more, as all the promises of enforcing illegal immigration has turned to bitter waters. The Sanctuary Cities and states like California are allowed to thrive, driving up taxes for its citizens. Even the Judicial branch is not fulfilling its duties to detain and deport all illegal aliens, they are just removing the criminals that taint America.
My fellow American, our country become a third world country, thanks to the corrupt politicians that betray our trust. You are right we must take our country back next November and fire these SOBS.
vote for America’s future in November.
I do not support the DREAM Act only because it marginalizes those that are here legally. We are worried about the illegals, something that is criminalized in every country I know except for the US. But what about the kids who are here legally but have no ‘support’ from congress because it is not politically expedient to do so. As Nina above said, the legal residents have to follow rules that send them back to their home countries. 
The author here said immigration should not be a pipe dream. I agree but it should be LEGAL.
The DREAM Act would be a great idea if it included ALL those brought here as children, who have completed high school and two years of college and are of good character.  Unfortuantely, it is only for ILLEGALS.  Children like my daughter, brought here legally, have no path to citizenship and must leave at age 21 when they are no longer classed as dependents of their parents.
Remove the word ‘UNDOCUMENTED’ from the Act and give young people brought here legally the same opportunity as those brought here illegally, and perhaps we can move forward.  As it is currently worded, the Act discriminates against young people brought here legally, and that’s wrong, stupid and unAmerican.
Families who came here the right way want to stay together, too.
There is a home for these children. It’s called their legal, home countries. NO to backdoor amnesty.
Completely agree with everything said in this article, congress needs to stop playing politics with the lives of hardworking people. I support the dream act !!!
I am a strong supporter of the Dream Act, and helping children get a proper education. Children of illegals are wanting to pursue and further their knowledge, but illegal acts made by the parents ultimately hurt their children. But these children are grown and raised in this country, that they proudly call home and they are more that willing to help their country. But restrictions and documentation problems prohibits them from doing so. Pass the bill get smarter and young people to rebuild this crippling economy and help fight for this nation.
Great Article, I support the Dream Act =D

If there ever is a creature that is equally feared, respected and mistrusted at the same time, it’s a journalist. It’s common to imagine a journalist with his nose inquisitively sniffing about, always prying and probing for a sensational scoop.
But Assignment: China, a film that documents the work of foreign journalists in post-Mao China, goes beyond this perception to reveal the real problems that journalists face under this stigma.
Assignment: China is a new documentary project by the USC U.S.-China Institute, an organization dedicated to the research and advocacy of a symbiotic relationship between the United States and China.
The film is a collaborative work between USCI staff and students to research, transcribe, shoot and edit all the clips and interviews. Award-winning USCI senior fellow, former CNN Senior Asia Correspondent and eight-year CNN Beijing Bureau Chief Mike Chinoy handled the writing and reporting.
The institute screened a 35-minute segment of the 110-minute film Monday, followed by a round-table discussion with Chinoy. Perhaps it was because the multimedia project is still under progress, but the film quality was fuzzy and at times transitions between interviews were rough and clipped.
But because of his experience and knowledge in the field of broadcast news in Asia, Chinoy’s narration in the film is smooth, seamless and eloquent, without intersecting the interviewees’ voices. In any case, the message that Assignment: China brought forth was clear and engaging.
The segment shown focuses on the period between 1979 and 1983, the initial years after China had begun opening up a diplomacy relationship with the United States in 1979.
It was also a time of much excitement and curiosity for the Americans. Finally, they would get the inside scoop on the happenings in China, where most foreigners were banned after the Cultural Revolution. The whole country had closed up under Chairman Mao’s regime, hiding behind a curtain of mystery on which the curious world could only speculate and often times fabricate.
Thus news coverage on Deng Xiaoping’s — China’s lead figure at the time — visit to Washington, D.C. was sensational. Footage in the film shows him smiling and waving amiably, and to the delight of Americans at the time, donning a cowboy hat.
Chinese attitudes toward foreign medi,a however, was not so friendly, as the film shows. After Deng’s 1979 visit, China allowed a selection of journalists to visit the nation on a specialized excursion, but under strict supervision and rigid regulations.
Journalists — cynical by nature — knew it was not going to be easy to report on China. After all, Chinese doors had only just tentatively begun to slide open. But still, each of them left their homeland with a vision to finally reveal an accurate picture of China and its people, only to be frustrated by the opposition and animosity they faced as a foreigner and a journalist.
Although journalists were allowed to set up full-time bureaus in Beijing, they were hardly allowed to travel out of the city. It took weeks of preparation — begging, groveling and phone calling — for a journalist to receive permits to travel out of Beijing.
Even within Beijing walls, foreign journalists had a tough time finding citizens who would actually talk to them. There was an unwritten law forbidding ordinary Chinese citizens to communicate with foreign reporters, and even if the journalist got specific permission from the government, the people were still afraid to risk repercussions.
An interview with Richard Bernstein, the first Time Beijing correspondent, recounts how a Chinese man named Liu Ching got arrested and sentenced to three years of “re-education” in prison for acquainting with a foreign reporter. The man later sneaked a detailed account of life in prison to Bernstein and subsequently received eight more years of prison.
Despite all these complications, the impact of that these journalists made can be felt simply by the fact that the world knows about most of the major events in China during that period.
All of these stories were somehow churned and squeezed out by journalists, who sometimes had to take a 20-hour train ride just to snag interviews with the locals. Yet the bits and bites of information they conveyed to the American public were paramount in affecting the diplomatic policies between the United States and China.
In the discussion after the screening, Chinoy said that although some of the information reported might have been understated or overhyped, he believed that the work of these journalists all fit together into a mosaic — a big picture that grasps an accurate and fair view of China today, despite Chinese paranoia toward foreign media.
“China shoots itself in the foot by heightening its secrecy and security towards the media,” Chinoy said. “When something happens and you’re not there, there is a greater likelihood of rumors and erroneous information.”
But China is increasingly opening up to media, Chinoy said. A big change came just before the 2008 Olympics, as can be seen by comparing the news coverage of the 1976 earthquake in Tangshan and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The media has finally started to penetrate the thick walls of China.
Assignment: China aims to share the battle of journalists to understand a dynamic, complex China shrouded by a rigid government throughout the tumultuous development of United States-China relations — struggling to scoop out stories, overcoming cultural and political challenges, rejoicing in their successes — all the while competing against rival journalists and meeting dreaded deadlines.

With Los Angeles experiencing record-breaking high temperatures last week, the recently released Hot Summer Days, has hit the city at just the right time. Directed by Tony Chan and Wing Shya, the film includes 16 of China’s top stars, from Hong Kong to the mainland.
Hot and heavy · Hot Summer Days focuses on love stories between people of various classes, from blue collar workers dreaming of better lives to a writer (Vivian Hsu) trying to woo a sushi cook (Daniel Wu). - Photos courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures 
Unlike a lot of Chinese films, Hot Summer Days received some foreign assistance. 20th Century Fox stepped forward to start international production and Hot Summer Days has become the first Chinese language film produced by the studio.
Although Hot Summer Days will not be released in Los Angeles until Friday, USC’s Outside the Box [Office] and the East Asian Studies Center held a preview screening at the USC School of Cinematic Arts on Sunday. Audiences experienced innocent love with laughter and tears, and were inspired by the idea that even the hottest days can be spent in a romantic tryst.
The movie is set during the hottest summer on record in Hong Kong, with temperatures reaching an astonishing 113 degrees Fahrenheit. As the government warns citizens to prepare for the abnormal weather, and passions start growing with the temperature, seven unbelievable stories come true.
Chauffeur Wah (Jacky Cheung) and foot masseuse Li Yan (Rene Liu) are average working-class citizens who dream of pursuing other, more exciting careers: the chauffeur dreams of racing Ferraris and the masseuse of being a pianist. Their lives intertwine when both suffer from heatstrokes  and are sent to the hospital.  A wrong text message connects the two dreamers’ fates, and a love story begins. In the text message world, they resume their dreams. The big question is whether their love will endure when they discover each others’ true identity.
At the same time, an air conditioning repairman, Ah Wai, (Nicholas Tse) finds himself enamored with biker chick Ding Dong (Vivian Hsu).
Young boy Da Fu (Xinbo Fu) bets his boss that the most beautiful girl (Angelababy) in the factory next door, will become his girlfriend. To prove his love, the girl asks him to stand outside in the heat for 100 days. Halfway through, the young boy witnesses the girl being taken out in her boss’ car, jeopardizing his determination to withstand the heat to win the heart of the one he loves.
All of these plots intertwine with many funny and moving moments — the film could be considered a hybrid between Love Actually and the romantic storyline of Inception. The film’s directors utilize the narrative structure of the former and decorate the story with time and space-shifting elements of the latter, but this ultimately does not make any creative breakthrough.
The forced mixture of these two creative movies did not help Chan and Shya win the audience’s hearts. Instead, audiences in China, where the movie was released earlier this year, criticized the familiar story elements. Many Chinese audiences said they expected the film to have an original concept, especially because of the cooperation between Chinese and American studios.
Although the construction of the narrative did not bring audiences extra surprise, the all-star cast never let the audience down.
Tse abandons his usual heroic figure and does a fine job as a simple handyman. Liu creates a rougher portrayal of her character, while adding a working-class charm to the role.
Although it has problems because of  limitations in storytelling, the exceptional cast elevates the film beyond its weak narrative structure.
The biker chick is played by Barbie Hsu (大S), not Vivian Hsu. Vivian’s the writer, as you not in your photo caption. Of course, the photo is of Angelababy…

2010-10-06,USC,China,"A professor of public ethics and citizenship at USC’s School of Policy, Planning, and Development has been elected as a fellow to the National Academy of Public Administration, a national organization that assists in Congressional research.
Professor Terry Cooper will be formally inducted into the academy on Nov. 18 in Washington, D.C.
Making connections · Professor Terry Cooper teaches citizenship and ethics at the School of Public Policy, Planning, and Development. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The NAPA is a non-partisan, non-profit organization that was established by a Congressional charter in 1967. The organization’s research and projects are mandated and funded primarily by Congress. It is not a government agency but rather an independent body with discretion.
“It allows Congress to have connections to people that can help with projects,” Cooper said.
With expertise from its 680 fellows, the academy provides key insight into issues of public administration and the workings of public organizations, in addition to serving an advisory role to government agencies.
The academy’s members are chosen from thousands of practitioners in fields of and related to public administration and political science.
As a fellow, Cooper will sit alongside other prominent figures, such as former and current presidential cabinet members, governors, city managers and deans of colleges and universities.
Cooper’s notoriety in the fields of ethics and civic engagement, which he considers his primary interests, earned him the credibility that contributed to his election as a fellow, said Jack Knott, dean of SPPD.
“He has written what I think is the most prominent book for public administrators. … His work is of value in both the public and private sectors,” Knott said. “It is an extremely important topic as we’ve recently learned with the Bell scandal.”
The scandal involved eight city officials from Bell, Calif., who were arrested for using public funds to inflate their own salaries.
Cooper is currently working on the sixth edition of his book, The Responsible Administrator, which is used in countless ethics courses around the world and SPPD’s own Citizenship and Public Ethics (PPD 240).
“It [became] required reading for all master of public administration programs in China in 2000.  … There are now over 100 [programs there], and this book is one in a set of core readings,” Cooper said.
Cooper is also particularly well known for his work with citizen participation and the democratic process, Knott said.
“He has a reputation both nationally and internationally, having done work here in Los Angeles looking at the roles of communities and neighborhoods and also some work in China with housing and other local issues,” Knott said.
Cooper’s performance as a professor is equally impressive, said Claire Feeney, a senior majoring in urban planning who has taken two classes with Cooper.
“He basically invented [PPD 240], because he literally wrote the whole book,” she said. “He likes class discussion that’s more driven by the students. … He really [values] student input and involvement.”
Cooper said he is primarily focusing on continuing the kinds of issues around which he has already built his reputation. In his capacity as a fellow, he will be looking closely at how the federal government handles ethics.
“The U.S. Office of Government Ethics, from my point of view, is not about ethics. It’s all about laws, and I would like to see them doing more with regard to cultivating [ethical behavior among] professionals,” he said.
Cooper said he is looking forward to having the opportunity to learn from a variety of academy colleagues in a manner that he believes reflects the interdisciplinary spirit of SPPD.
“One of the advantages of being in the academy is you get pulled into projects you might not otherwise do,” he said.
After his induction in November, Cooper will participate in a discussion about future academy projects in which he might be interested in participating.
Cooper has worked with NAPA before, participating in a research panel funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.
Knott said he believes Cooper’s successes in academia will provide notable contributions to the national academy.
“Given the scale of news media and the size of political jurisdictions, it’s easy for neighborhoods and citizens to feel disconnected from the political process. [Cooper] has been a real leader in addressing this very issue,” Knott said.

In a joint media briefing, Andrew Guzman discussed his vision and the importance of continuing diversity initiatives.

A recent Field Poll has shown that California’s Proposition 23 is losing support in the polls.
Proposition 23 would suspend the implementation of the Global Warming Solutions Act — AB 32 — until California unemployment is down to 5.5 percent.
The latest polls show 45 percent of voters oppose the proposition, with only 34 supporting it.
The proposition was introduced by Texas oil giants Valero and Tesoro, along with a refinery owned by billionaires Charles and David Koch. It would suspend the state law that requires greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to levels they were at in 1990 by the year 2020.
The proposition has found little support in California. Democrats are overwhelmingly against it and Republicans seem divided on the issue.
Though Republican Carly Fiorina has voiced her support for Proposition 23, Republican gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman has said she opposes it, preferring a one-year moratorium instead of completely doing away with the clean energy bill.
“Climate change is going to get worse fast,” said Mark Bernstein, managing director of the USC Energy Institute. “[Students] are young enough to see that. If Prop 23 passes, in the near-term, there’ll be less opportunities for doing things that are green.”
Bernstein added that green technology is the only job industry currently expanding in the state.
“Where are the jobs going to be when you guys graduate? The only sector that is growing is green technologies,” Bernstein said. “That’s where the jobs are. And it’s only there because the government is putting it in place.”
Campus activist groups also oppose the proposition and protested at Valero gas stations across the state.
“Clean energy is our future,” said Ryan Waters, campaign coordinator of the No On Prop 23 CALPIRG chapter at USC. “We need to do everything we can to make sure California is a leader in clean energy and clean technology.”
Proponents of Proposition 23 say it will cost money to implement AB 32, which is set to start in 2012.
According to arguments made in favor of the proposition in the California Voter Guide, “AB 32 will cause California households to face higher prices both directly for electricity, natural gas and gasoline, and indirectly as businesses pass costs for [greenhouse gas] reduction on to consumers.”
But Bernstein said the long-term costs are nothing compared to the ultimate benefits of AB 32.
“Will it cost us? In the long-term, maybe,” Bernstein said. “But by the time we get out there, technology will improve and it probably won’t cost us anything. The benefits in the near-term significantly outweigh the costs.”
Micah Scheindlin, political director of USC College Democrats, agreed.
“Their arguments regarding revenue are wholly wrong,” Scheindlin said. “If anything, passing Proposition 23 would stunt the growth of California’s green tech economy and therefore cost the state revenue.”
The proposition’s opponents include The League of Women’s Voters and liberal college groups including California College Democrats.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger also opposes the proposition, having originally signed AB 32 into legislation in 2006.
“The effort to suspend AB 32 is the work of greedy oil companies who want to keep polluting in our state and making profits,” Schwarzenegger said after the measure qualified for the November ballot.
Two advocacy groups, the Courage Campaign and CREDO Action, have called for a boycott of Valero and Beacon gas stations in order to punish Valero for providing financial sponsorship of the initiative.
In the end, Bernstein said, students’ futures are in their hands.
“[AB 32] is not overcoming the jobless rate yet, but it’s getting there,” Bernstein said. “I really want the students to get out and vote.”
The voters in California continue to demonstrate that they are the most ignorant creature on earth!  The information used to pass ab32 and guide the CARB is bogus.  It amazes me that Califonians continue to support this policy when it kills jobs.  The notion of green jobs is a ruse… will not happen.  California loses.
What a bunch of dunderheads.  WHERE ARE ALL THESE “GREEN” JOBS????????  Hey, give me some of that KoolAid.
I can’t wait until Prop 23 fails.  All the people yipping about clean air are usually poor students and ex-hippies who will be hit the hardest by energy price increases.  As far as all the green jobs..yeah right, they will be created, IN CHINA.  You really think some company is going to produce solar panels in California’s business climate?  How long will that last without Government subsidies?  All this talk about “being the global leader in clean air and energy”is ideological crap.  THE WHOLE REST OF THE WORLD WOULD HAVE TO GET ON BOARD TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.  Good luck convincing China, the Soviet Union, and India to name a few to change.  A good business person knows how to pick his/her battles.  
The people of California never fail to amaze me.   We have had a Democratic controlled legislature  and 2 Democratic senators since the 90’s and look where we are. Some of the highest unemployment in the country, the highest or nearly the highest taxes in every category.  Ridiculous car registration fees, along with some of the highest fees in the country for just about everything else.  Our gas prices are some of the highest in the country.  We have 9% of the U.S. population, yet have 33% of the welfare expense. Illegal immigration is running amok. I would bet half of the children in the L.A. unified school district at this point are anchor babies. (I remember mobile clinic quite well in dental school..went to USC myself). Businesses are leaving California in Droves, and when energy prices and other restrictions increase it is only going to get worse.
Fortunately, as a dentist I can work anywhere.  However, for those of you planning to stay in this state, you need to get off your high ideological horses and start facing reality.  This green industry so many of you think will materialize will be far overshadowed by other job losses.  It is going to be you and 30 other people competing for every job soon.  Actually, that’s already the case…its only going to get worse.
Thank God that I do not live in California. To vote NO on Proposition 23 is akin to drinking the koolaid provided by Jim Jones.
Really doctor dave? Really? I’m glad you don’t live in california either. Stick to areas where critical thinking and fact checking is discouraged. Allow California to provide the intelligent solutions that the rest of the country will soon follow.
The U.S. could go to zero emissions and it would not make a difference the way other nations are building up.
Doctor Dave thank God you don’t live here, Stay in you trailer
My Dog, people, does EVERYTHING have to be about money?  Heavens, it’s going to cost me more to run my vacuum cleaner, so I guess kids in the future should just breathe smog!  How do these people who whine about a little more cost justify their existence on this planet??
An incredibly over simplified viewpoint you have there.
Don’t we want to make pot legal?
92% of funding for Yes on 23 comes from oil; 71% comes from out of Calif.  So WTF are oil and out-of-state interests supporting 23?   Ans: $$$
Yes on 23 claims it will save 1 million jobs; Calif labor says the opposite.  I’m inclined to distrust big oil.
The issue with Prop 23 is the clause for 5.5% unemployment rate.  Considering that the natural unemployment rate is usually thought of being close to 6%, there is little possibility that the bill would ever be repealed.  That clause is merely put in there to snake its way through for people who ultimately want to defend the environment but hold a higher priority for the economy–without realizing that the environment isn’t even a factor for this proposition at all.
Sounds a lot like the PG&E Monopoly act in 2008.  “Sure you can go into the power business..it just will take a 2/3 impossible super-majority.”  They called that one the “voters rights” bill.  It was a sham.  I can’t stand corporate meddling with our affairs any longer.  How is this legal?  I have an idea.  Lets pass a the “FU” bill, which bars any corporate donations to political campaigns in California.  Get these greedy a&&holes out of our state politics.
AB32 is a tax on energy production. We already have plenty of taxes, we don’t need  another one.
For short-sighted people such as yourself, that’s what it is.  But it benefits green tech by making it more cost-effective and cost-competitive.  So its a give and take.  But typical conservatives like you can only see short-term.  If people like you ruled the world, no one would ever invest in anything without an immediate payoff.  We’d be living in the stone age.
Can I get the legistlature to tax my compitition so my overpriced, unproven product can be”Cost-Effective and Cost-competitive”. Someday you will grow up but by then it will be too late to crawl out from under the foot of a government completely running your life and ditacting your thought.
No surprising with all the lies and misleading advertising that the no on 23 campaign is spreading.
The enforcement of AB 32 will cause an economic disaster for California that will keep other states from passing such legislation, and probably do more harm for the cause than it will help the environment.
Points to ponder on AB 32 / Prop 23:
° AB 32 is not a pollution law, it is a global warming law, but it won’t have any effect on global warming.
° Prop 23, in spite of fear-mongering by opponents, does not repeal any clean-air laws. It does not increase local pollution.
° CARB over-estimated diesel emmisions by 340%. What else have they over-estimated?
° Key CARB personnel caught lying about credentials and then failing to reveal this after it is discovered internally before AB 32 passed, until after AB 32 passed. What else are they lying about and with-holding?
° Sacramento State University reports estimated cost of $3734 per year per family due strictly to AB 32.
° CARB has admitted that California alone cannot have an impact on reducing global warming and CO2 emissions.
° US EPA acknowledges that US action alone will not impact the world CO2 levels;
° US EPA (11 July 2010) said that bills in Congress will not reduce the total use of gas and oil of 20 million gallons per day for decades.
° LAO (CA Legislative Analyst Office) stated: CA economy at large will be adversely affected by implementation of climate-related policies that are not in place elsewhere. (Letter to Dan Logue, 13 May 2010)
° Even CARB’s own economic experts have recognized the fact that jobs will be lost because of AB 32. In fact, they recommend establishing a “Worker Transition Program” to provide assistance to people who lose their jobs because of AB 32 regulations.
° AB 32 does nothing for local pollution, nor does Proposition 23 do anything to increase local pollution.
When the loudest objections to any candidacy or initiative are focused on vilifying its financial backers, this often indicates that its opponents’ arguments on its merits are weak.
Vote yes on Prop 23 and suspend AB32.
wow nice copy and pasting, this same exact post is on many more websites, go away troll your post is irrelivent
The California Jobs Initiative (CJI) is an oil corporation farce and fraud. There is no connection, whatsoever, between greenhouse gas emission reduction and the loss of jobs. This notion is an insult to the intelligence of the people of California. In fact, there is job growth in the clean, renewable energy industry. Chevron employs 65,000 worldwide and CJI is not going to change this. The only jobs created by the oil industry are clean-up jobs after oil spills and deep water, blow-outs and pump-handler jobs jobs. CJI will make fantastic profits for the oil industry, increase air pollution, especially in communities around their refineries and there will not be lower gas prices. Koch Industries, Valero and Tesoro are super Enrons. Since when did the oil companies start to show any concern for the unemployed and their families and for small businesses?
I’m just curious what business it is that you own/operate?  Of course more regulation and higher energy cost will have an affect on jobs.  Lets face it, if there were money to be made in this “green energy” sector don’t you think entrepreneurs would be jumping all over this. They would be happy to put money up front to get a return later.  But, unlike you, they understand California’s anti-business climate and aren’t going near it with a ten foot pole. Any manufacturing jobs will quickly be outsourced overseas.  So, sit and hold your breath waiting for those jobs to materialize.
