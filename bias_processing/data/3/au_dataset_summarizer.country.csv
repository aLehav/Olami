2009-02-12,AU,China,"A firefighter died after a 40-story Beijing luxury hotel, scheduled to open this year, burned down Monday near the end of the Chinese New Year's celebrations, CNN.com reported.
The Mandarin Oriental Hotel was unoccupied at the time of the fire, but one firefighter died of smoke inhalation. Six other firefighters and a construction worker were hospitalized, according to CNN.com.
Police suspect fireworks to be the cause of the fire, according to CNN.com. Central China Television, which is constructing a complex next door to the hotel, apologized after claiming staffers authorized the shooting of fireworks that accidentally started the blaze.

2009-08-13,AU,China,"To think of D.C. is to think of following dreams to the White House, Capitol Hill or maybe a lobbying firm. But for every congressional hearing, D.C.'s got a slightly more exciting local concert for you to attend. Sure, possibly for the first time in your life, all of your favorite bands are nearly guaranteed to stop near where you're living, but the music scene in the District has got any touring act beat. Below are some bands to keep an ear on.
The Aquarium
www.myspace.com/aquariummusic
Audiophiles know that Dischord defined D.C.'s music scene beginning in the '80s and continuing all the way through the early-2000s break-up of Q and Not U. While the label was and still is home to D.C. hardcore, and the aforementioned dance-punks have indeed stopped the music, The Aquarium have the whole post-post-punk thing down. It's also no accident Laura Harris lends her sticks to the sounds of two bands; she owns that kit. The band has a new single coming out this fall, and possibly a new LP in the not-so-distant future.
Benjy Ferree
www.benjyferree.com
Benjy Ferree virtually impossible to compare accurately to any other artist. His sound is part doo-wop, part rock 'n' roll and all passion. Ferree is from D.C. and cites area legends like Chuck Brown and Fugazi as influences. His interests are diverse, and his music reflects that. His latest, ""Come Back to the Five and Dime, Bobby Dee Bobby Dee,"" is a nod to Bobby Driscoll, the child actor who played Peter Pan.  With Ferree's fiancée Harris at the drums, its obvious musicianship is at the heart of every track.
Imperial China
www.myspace.com/imperialchina
If you were absolutely forced to choose one style of music to define D.C.'s sound (and good luck with that), post-punk would definitely be it, and Imperial China's got it down to a science. They sound like the District, but in a new and constantly surprising way. Like every self-respecting post-punk band, they're angry - that guitar wails, for sure. But unlike the rest, they explore the nuances of that angst and come out with something special. 
Midnight Kids
www.myspace.com/midnightkidsmusic
It's hard to explain why a band who seemingly have yet to play a gig made this list unless you know about the Apes. Three-quarters of this stellar new quartet are ex-members of the former D.C. stand-out. The passion that made the Apes special is still there with a impressive new twist: more polished, more mature, more, well, Stereolab. The band still owns their beat, but now its down-right dreamy, like Blondie on a Sunday. Midnight Kids have a bright future that is definitely worth listening to.
Noon:30
www.myspace.com/noon30band
Noon:30 could be called D.C.'s answer to The Noisettes. But they're better than that. Their harmony screams polish, the distortion screams garage and lead singer Blue S. Moon just all out screams, or croons. It's beautiful, electronic post-punk pop. ""French Song"" is sung, unsurprisingly, in French but with a fearless American accent, which makes sense since this all-female trio is all about courageous interpretation.
True Womanhood
www.myspace.com/truewomanhood
Missed Sonic Youth touring this summer? You'll probably want to check out True Womanhood. Genuinely like nothing else in the city, the band plays music in a way you've never seen before: guitars bowed with other guitars; a giant metal, well, thing played for percussion. Perhaps one of the District's most experimental bands, their music is definitely some of its most beautiful and complex.

2009-08-13,AU,China,"Although swiping your card at TDR and sitting with your new posse at may initially seem cool to incoming freshman, it will get old - especially if you don't take a TDR hiatus every once in awhile. Sure, TDR has stir-fry, a sweet salad bar and all-you-can-eat ice cream. But it is crucial to embrace other restaurants as well by leaving campus on occasion and sampling some of the local area's most delicious cuisines. Depending on your mood and cravings, here are some excellent places you should definitely check out this semester. 
Thai: Neisha
Location: 4445 Wisconsin Ave., N.W., directly across from the Tenleytown Metro stop.
Why Go There? Neisha is a popular AU student destination that serves up an incredible Asian cuisine. It has an extensive menu of soups, salads, appetizers, entrées and desserts. Try ordering the satay (chicken skewers with peanut sauce) for an appetizer, followed by the grilled salmon in banana leaves for an entrée. If you're still hungry, order ""a la mode"" for dessert (fried banana served with young coconut ice-cream.) 
Sushi: Raku
Location: 7240 Woodmont Ave. in Bethesda, Md.
Why Go There? Tom Sietsema of The Washington Post Magazine said, ""If there's a Bethesda restaurant I'd like to see cloned, it's Raku!"" The restaurant is decorated with bamboo, cozy booths and colorful parasols that hang from the ceiling. Try ordering the seafood spring rolls or any type of sushi listed on the menu - you won't be disappointed. 
Italian: Angelico
Location: 4529 Wisconsin Ave., N.W. in Tenleytown.
Why Go There? Huge menu, awesome food, prime location, AU delivery - need we say more? Angelico is an Italian eatery, but offers everything from buffalo wings and roasted lamb salad to pizza, pasta and cannoli. It's a great place to pick up a quick bite when you're in a rush and are craving some comfort food. Try ordering either the basic spaghetti with meat sauce or treat yourself to the shrimp italiano (fresh shrimp sautéed with garlic and marinara sauce, tossed with fettuccine.)  
Pizza: 2 Amys
Location: 3715 Macomb St., N.W.
Why Go There? 2 Amys has been written up as one of the best pizza restaurants in D.C. for years. Within walking distance of AU, 2 Amys is at the fingertips of students. D.C. Foodies wrote that ""2 Amys is hands down, the most wonderful place in D.C. to get gourmet pizza."" Skip an appetizer (although the potato and prosciutto croquettes are delightful) and go straight to the pizza menu. Just like traveling to Italy, you can order anything on the menu and not be disappointed. Both the classic Margherita and the Calabrese (tomato, anchovy, fresh mozzarella, parsley and olive) are among the restaurant's best.  
Burgers: Five Guys
Location: Everywhere. (Georgetown, Bethesda, Dupont Circle, Arlington, Va., Chinatown, etc.) 
Why Go There? For out-of-towners who aren't familiar with this incredible burger chain, it's time to experience its utter deliciousness. Five Guys serves up classic burgers and cheeseburgers with no trans-fats and a plethora of available toppings including mayonnaise, onions, lettuce, pickles, grilled mushrooms, jalapeÃ?Â±os and the like. Also popular are the french fries, either regular or Cajun-style, and its kosher hot dogs.  
Burritos: Chipotle
Location: 4301 Wisconsin Ave., N.W. # B in Tenleytown.
Why Go There? Make sure you've been fasting for days before diving into one of these massive burritos! Chipotle's Mexican concoctions are huge, yet incredibly delicious and addictive. A growing chain around the country, Chipotle serves up scrumptious burritos, soft tacos, burrito bowls (a burrito without the tortilla) and, most recently, burrito salads! First-timers must try a steak or chicken burrito with rice, your choice of beans and a handful of other fresh toppings.  
Frozen Yogurt: Mr. Yogato
Location: 1515 17th St., N.W. near Dupont Circle
Why Go There? Trying to avoid those freshmen 15? Make a visit to Mr. Yogato, a very unique fro-yo parlor. Mr. Yogato carries 18 flavors of non-fat frozen yogurt and 40 different toppings including Captain Crunch, Junior Mints and toasted mini Eggo waffles and anything else their patrons could think up. The best part about visiting this healthy dessert haven is the crazy rules created by Mr. Yogato himself. If you wear a Yogato stamp on your head, you get 10 percent off your purchase, or you can get 20 percent off your total for reciting the Stirling battlefield speech from Braveheart in a great Scottish accent. Visit www.mryogato.com/rules.php for more Yogato rules.

2009-08-13,AU,China,"For newcomers to AU and to D.C., this list is a guide to some of the neighborhoods often frequented by AU students throughout the year.  From dining and shopping, to bars and clubs, these locations throughout the city include venues enjoyed by many. 
ADAMS MORGAN
Adams Morgan, accessible by Metro, and is only three stops down the red line. The neighborhood includes a wide variety of attractions, including shops, restaurants and bars.
The Metro stop is called Woodley Park-Zoo/Adams Morgan, and the entrance to the Smithsonian National Zoo is a short walk up Connecticut Avenue. Like many other Smithsonian museums, admission to the National Zoo is free of charge.
A walk in the other direction from the Metro stop and down Calvert Street will get you to the heart of Adams Morgan.
Adams Morgan is known as one of the hippest, most happening spots in town. Hookah bars, regular bars, restaurants and other attractions make this area a weekend hot spot for AU students.
Dan Raby, a junior in the School of Communication, said he enjoys the dynamic of the restaurants and nightlife of the neighborhood.
""I like Adams Morgan because if you want to do something, you can always find it in Adams Morgan ... If you want to find any restaurant, from something fancy to little holes-in-the-wall, it's in Adams Morgan.""
One example is Tryst Coffeehouse, a favorite coffee shop of Florence Lumsden, a junior in the School of International Studies. The Diner is a restaurant adjacent to Tryst that Lumsden said she also enjoys. 
""It is open really late, pretty much all night, and they have nice food and nice dessert,"" said Lumsden.
Lumsden also said that there are many popular bars in Adams Morgan, but that most of them only admit those who are 21 and up.
Another quirk of Adams Morgan is the annual ""Crafty Bastards Arts & Crafts Fair"" put on by the Washington City Paper. Raby said he goes every year. 
""They have clothes, jewelry, and all sorts of things,"" he said.  This year's fair is scheduled for Saturday, Oct. 3, according to the City Paper Web site. 
DOWNTOWN 
Downtown D.C., which includes Chinatown, Penn Quarter and the National Mall, has many attractions including national buildings such as the White House, the Capitol Building, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress and many others. 
In addition, Smithsonian museums, such as the Air and Space Museum and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, line the National Mall.
""The Mall's always great. Even if you don't want to see a museum or art gallery, it's nice to go down there and find a green spot to rest,"" Raby said.
Many AU students tour the national monuments around the mall multiple times.
In addition, the National Gallery of Art's Sculpture Garden is open all week and includes a fountain area with seating. The National Gallery of Art also opens an outdoor ice skating rink November through March, according to its Web site.
Downtown also has a bustling nightlife. Ultrabar, Lotus Lounge and Avenue Night Club are all in that area. 
""Ultrabar is a cool place because it has really awesome lights and cool music, but if you go on weekends and on Saturdays, it's really packed and really hard to get in,"" Lumsden said.
DUPONT CIRCLE
Dupont Circle, only four Metro stops from Tenleytown on the red line, comes alive at night with its many bars and restaurants.
""Dupont Circle is a really good location to meet up with friends,"" said Eric Elliot, a junior in the Kogod School of Business.
A favorite spot in Dupont Circle for AU students is Kramer's Books & Afterwords Cafe, a combination bookshop and restaurant, appreciated for its late hours. It is open 7:30 a.m. through 1 a.m. daily and 24 hours on Fridays and Saturdays, according to its Web site. ""It's kind of a pricey place to eat, but a wonderful place to go at night to get a fabulous dessert,"" Lumsden said.
Student's looking for international cuisine will find plenty to eat in Dupont Circle. 
 ""Name a country, it's probably there,"" Raby said.

2009-11-12,AU,China,"PHILADELPHIA — Libertarians are a diverse bunch. Some of them wish they could abolish government entirely. Others just want its power reduced. But what unites them is their shared belief that the state should be substantially smaller and do drastically less. 
Here at AU, the libertarians have a club. AU Students For Liberty is a small operation. I’m told that fewer than 20 students attend regular meetings or events. Still, there are few diehards, most of whom I met this past weekend when I traveled with AUSFL to the 2009 Students For Liberty Mid-Atlantic Conference. The event took place at Drexel University, smack dab in the middle of the Cradle of Liberty itself — Philadelphia. The journey I took there and back again is something I won’t forget soon. It taught me about an alternative governing philosophy, but it also gave me a glimpse at what it’s like to be part of a political counterculture.
Our odyssey began last Friday with a Chinatown bus ride. On the way from D.C. to Philly, I got a primer on libertarian philosophy and policy from a few members of AUSFL. For two hours, I asked hundreds of questions and took furious notes. The young libertarians explained their core principles of nonaggression and self-ownership. They argued that taxation is slavery. They dismissed the entire idea of slicing up the economic pie, saying the solution is simply to make that pie bigger. 
Throughout the conversation, I had several realizations about libertarians. First, many of them don’t love Ron Paul. True libertarians want government out of their lives in every respect, so they don’t understand Paul’s pro-life stance or his opposition to gay marriage. They say the state shouldn’t be involved in any of this.
Second, libertarians disagree amongst themselves — a lot. In fact, it seems to me, based on my little exposure, that there is greater diversity of thought within the libertarian movement than within the conservative or progressive movements. There is a great libertarian debate over just how tiny government should be. A few of them like public education, but most don’t. Many think the government should run the justice system, the military and the police force, but some don’t.
As I learned talking to AU and Drexel students at a mixer late Friday night, there are two main camps within the libertarian movement: the minarchists and the anarcho-capitalists or anarchists. The former advocate extremely limited government. The latter, at least ideally, prefer no government at all.
Learning about anarcho-capitalism shocked me, as I imagine it would shock many people. Certainly, I am familiar with the argument that limited government means more freedom. I get it. It’s compelling. I can conceive of a scenario in which America reverts to the traditions of the Founding generation and structures government simply to provide justice, defense, security and maybe a limited form of welfare. That transformation, which is what minarchists want, would be radical, but it could happen.
What I found unbelievable was that anarcho-capitalists think the Founders’ government was way too big. They have so much faith in capitalism, so much faith in free exchange, that they literally wish for a world where markets make the rules. They philosophically and practically think the state is a problem. Its abolishment, they argue, is the rational endgame of the liberty movement. 
These are radical views. They fly in the face of the Founders’ intent. They’re outside the mainstream of American politics. I think they’re insane and an overwhelming majority of Americans — nearly everyone — would reject them outright. 
The students I talked to know this. They’ve faced reality. None of them wear rose-colored glasses. The minarchists understand government will always be bigger than they’d like and the anarcho-capitalists know they’ll never have the government-free society of their dreams.
At Saturday’s conference, the students and the speakers made mention of these realities. The presenters — college professors, organization leaders and authors — spoke of setting small goals and pushing for incremental change.
I left the conference early, but I stayed long enough to get the gist. I saw Irena Schneider, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, give an impassioned speech in her capacity as Mid-Atlantic Director. I saw Eagle columnist Alex Knepper realize he was the moderate in the room. And most importantly, I saw a group of earnest political activists enjoying each other’s company, which is always cool. 
The Students For Liberty may have unconventional views about government, but they’re well within the mainstream as far as how to have a good time. I hardly knew any of them before last weekend, but everyone was accommodating and appreciative of an Eagle writer tagging along.
I had many personal firsts last weekend. I made my first visit to Philly. I ate my first Philly Cheesesteak. And for the first, and likely last time, I saw an apartment full of libertarians sing “Don’t Stop Believing” at the top of their lungs.
“...Some will win, some will lose/Some were born to sing the blues.” 
Sounds like libertarian economics to me.

2009-12-03,AU,China,"In mid-March of 2004, the government of Angola was preparing to welcome a cohort of foreign dignitaries. Government officials deeply desired to impress their guests. After all, the ambassadors they were welcoming had just provided Angola with a $2 billion loan. In a world that has all but forgotten the African continent, foreign investment is especially appreciated by the few nations that receive it.
It may surprise some that these were not American diplomats, nor ambassadors from Western nations that Angola was greeting. Instead, it was the People’s Republic of China that was being welcomed. Delegates from Beijing not only visited Angola that year, but also Algeria, Gabon and Nigeria. These trips — and the economic agreements that accompanied them — were a part of China’s increasing efforts to integrate itself with the African continent. Although this intent may seem benign, the regional sphere of influence China is cultivating has several troubling implications.
Why has Beijing been compelled to reach out to African nations? Analysis indicates that it is China’s expanding demand for oil that has stimulated its proactive African relations.
While it was a net exporter of oil in the 1990s, by 2006 China had become the world’s third largest importer of fossil fuels. Obviously, if its booming economy is to be sustained, Beijing must procure an increasing supply of energy. Estimates indicate that China’s demand for imported oil are to sharply increase from 3.6 million barrels per day in 2006 to 13.3 million barrels per day in 2030. 
Clearly, this 10 million barrel addition will be a significant burden. Without cultivating foreign relations with regions that chronically export fossil fuel, the world’s oil supply might by-pass China. 
Enter Africa. What do Angola, Gabon, Nigeria all have in common? No twist here — they all export copious amounts of oil.
Consequentially, commerce between China and Africa increased 45 percent between 2007 and 2008 alone. By January this year, Africa was exporting an astounding 80 percent of its oil to China. However, Beijing also recognizes the importance of not only trade, but increased investment. Besides its loan to Angola, China has financed a $300 million dam in Ethiopia, provided a $2.5 million interest free loan to the Central African Republic and purchased $2.3 billion stake in a Nigerian oil rig. 
At this point, some may be wondering where the problem is in this. Why does this involvement give the Chinese a diplomatic advantage in the region? Western nations still give aid to Africa. Moreover, many European powers still assist in investment within there former colonies.
All true. Yet African nations have been swayed by the results of Chinese involvement. The minister of construction in the Congo Republic has been quoted as saying, “The Chinese build things, the Europeans don’t.” This suggests that this regional influence of China is developing to the detriment of that of the West.
More troubling to Western nations are the conditions that China attaches to its African investment — or lack of them. Beijing has given aid to disgraced leaders like Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Omar al-Bashir of Sudan.
This disregard for humanitarian concerns that should cause nations world wide to be concerned with China’s increased involvement with Africa. Unfortunately, Beijing remains unperturbed. When asked if the genocide in Darfur should prevent Sudan from attaining Chinese loans, the Chinese Foreign Minister uttered a cold, terse reply: “Business is business.”

2011-09-13,AU,China,"Having lived in D.C. for three years and just outside of it for most of my life, I’ve realized that you have to be borderline-obsessed with the Redskins, pandas and cheeseburgers to truly fit in in this town. Have a conversation with any Washingtonian about Hightower’s chances of being the ‘Skins starting running back, giving Tai Shan back to China or Bobby Flay’s potato chip-laden burgers and you’re in for life. 
In the recent years, “burgermania” has taken over the city with New York City imports Shake Shack and P.J. Clarke’s, and President Obama’s fixation on Ray’s Hell Burger. Here are a few new-to-the-D.C.-area burger joints worth checking out that won’t break the bank. 
SHAKE SHACK
Metro: Dupont Circle (Red Line)
Having joined D.C. in early summer, Shake Shack has made a seamless transition from New York City to the District’s burger elite. At Shake Shack you’ll find “roadside” burgers, hot dogs, frozen custard and (surprise!) beer and wine.  Stick with the classic “ShackBurger” (with cheese, crisp lettuce, roma tomatoes, “ShackSauce” and topped with the best burger bun imaginable), an order of crinkle fries and one of the Shack’s root beer floats.
If you’re feeling extra hungry, try the frozen custard for dessert; along with the signature flavors, the custard menu features a different flavor every day and changes each month. And, as if they couldn’t make their way further into the hearts of Washingtonians, Shake Shack has a mini-menu at Nationals Park.
Bobby’s Burger Palace
Metro: Foggy Bottom (Blue/Orange Line)
Be prepared to wait in line for one of Bobby Flay’s burger creations, as the joint just opened early this month. Flay’s Burger Palace offers every kind of gourmet burger topping you can imagine (watercress and pickled jalapeños, anyone?) along with shakes, sweet potato fries and onion rings. The Palace offers salad and sandwiches too, but why eat one of those when Bobby Flay’s grilling the burgers?
Standouts include the “Crunchburger,” topped with double American cheese and a heap of potato chips (in fact, every burger on the menu can be “crunchified”). Finish your meal with a pistachio milkshake and call it a day.
Elevation Burger
Metro: Court House (Orange Line)
What makes Elevation Burger so unique is its use of “elevated products” and an “elevated” dining experience, according to the restaurant itself. But what really makes Elevation Burger unique is that you can order any burger “bloody,” catering to the ravenous carnivore in all of us.
Eco-friendly diners can rejoice in the use of organic, grass-fed and free-range beef and fresh produce. (Even the tables, chairs and paint are made of recycled materials.) As for the menu, try a malted milkshake or the “Vertigo burger,” a build-your-own burger that allows the hungriest of hungry to fit ten patties under the bun. 
BGR: The Burger Joint
Metro: Dupont Circle, Bethesda (Red Line)
BGR: The Burger Joint claims that they offer the “one burger YOU MUST HAVE before you die.” While the attitude is a bit egotistical, the place does offer a damn good burger. BGR’s classic burger features the menu’s star: a prime, dry-aged beef patty that’s topped with a sesame seed brioche bun. The menu also offers turkey, tuna, veggie and lamb burgers along with double-fried Yukon Gold and sweet potato fries. Try the sliders, mini versions of the classic burger, with a side of the “green standard” fries: they’re grilled asparagus spears topped with Parmesan cheese.
Want a free meal? Order the “9 pounder,” a massive burger featuring a 15.4-pound patty with two heads of lettuce, eight tomatoes, three red onions and four whole pickles. And finish it.

2011-10-11,AU,China,"I’d like to think I am from a country with great potential. 
No, I am not talking about the United States, but about Brazil, where I lived for nine years. 
We’ve had a 7.5 percent growth rate in the last year and a booming economy even amid the current crisis. We have constant oil discoveries, a World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. And we are not only seen as the most promising country in Latin America for investment, but are beginning to trade in the big leagues with countries like China. 
Our accomplishments have bumped our rank in the Human Development Report to 73, or the “High Human Development” sector. However, we are still below the regional average of Latin America and the Caribbean, due to not only our multidimensional poverty but also to our corrupt and poisoned government. 
After the events that have been happening this week, in both New York City and D.C., I could not help but parallel Occupy Wall Street and Occupy D.C. to the corruption that plagues my country. Both protests are branches of Occupy Together, a grassroots protest against the greed and corruption of the wealthiest 1 percent of society. 
If only such a protest could come to Brazil.
If there’s one thing Brazilians know, it’s greed and corruption. We are from a country that is held back by the poverty that affects the majority of its population. Nevertheless, instead of addressing these issues, corrupt politicians take away the money, time and effort needed to bring Brazilians back to their feet. 
A perfect example is current federal deputy of São Paulo, Paulo Maluf. An ex-state governor of São Paulo, mayor of the City of São Paulo, congressman and presidential candidate, Maluf has been convicted of “maladministration” and is wanted for money laundering by a New York prosecutor, according to The Economist. 
Through this conviction and Maluf’s current indictment for alleged fraud, it is common Brazilian belief that Maluf has been accused of stealing money from public government projects and embezzling it into his private life. There is even a verb inspired by the man himself: malufar — to steal public money from the people. 
Another example is former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. It is illegal for a president to promote or show obvious preference to any type of candidate during election time. However, Lula not only promoted current president Dilma Rousseff on radio shows, but also was featured in TV campaign ads. 
What I find most upsetting is not the fact that these politicians are so corrupt, but that Brazilians continue to let them participate in the government. Despite Maluf’s suspected and proven wrongdoings against the Brazilian population, not only has the government decided to drop further charges against him as a result of legal loopholes, but Maluf is constantly re-elected into government positions despite his dubious history. Continuing the disturbing trend, Lula basically picks our country’s next president, due to his immense popularity amongst the population, and receives no form of punishment. 
Brazilians may have no memory, but sadly, many of them also have no education. They are not taught to think critically, to notice bias, to think for themselves or even know the functions of different government officials. However, seeing as the government refuses to educate the people, it is up to informed and frustrated citizens to help the uneducated and poor population. 
For this reason, I applaud those who are participating in Occupy D.C. 
It is up to the people to keep checks and balances on their government. Although the United States may be going in a somewhat opposite direction economically compared to Brazil, its citizens stand for honesty and just politics. This is the mindset that sets the first world apart from the third world, and the successful from the stuck.
Maybe one day, Brazilians as a people will also be able to occupy our capital, Brasilia, and demand for the just and honest government we deserve and need, if we ever wish to achieve our potential.

2012-04-10,AU,China,"•Someone remind me why I stayed at AU while the rest of my family is on vacation... on a beautiful island far from the wicked stench of DC sewer air...



•I like you a lot, but I'm worried if I tell you, hanging out will just get way too awkward.
•""And I have known the eyes already, known them all...""
Thank you other Eliot ranter :)
•Seriously, stop caring about other people's sex lives. It's none of your business what I choose to do. Stop trying to force your values down my throat, because I didn't ask for your opinion.
•congratulations, you read an article on promiscuity. now read one on sincerity and come back when you give a crap about how 'depressed' we're going to be for our 'promiscuity'.
•I intern, have a job, volunteer, take 16 credits, and have a pretty active social life. But what am I thinking about most of the time? How excited I am to have explosive sex with my f*** buddy.
•@Pitt bomb threats--yes.  My house is a few minutes away from one of the campuses.  It is very sad to see this happening.
•Do you want to know why I hate the feminists on this campus? It's because they never shut up- I am in the same sociology classes with you semester after semester and I am tired of hearing what you have to say. The classes I am in are not about feminism, so if you could STFU I would appreciate it...
•You got that something that keeps me so off balance.
•@""there are people in this world who would kill you, your family, your friends, anyone who is opposed to them in a heartbeat. But there are people out there stopping them.""  The world is not black and white like you portray. It’s not ‘the bad guys vs us, the good guys’. People don’t randomly hate other people for no reason.  Maybe think about WHY they hate us and what we CAN DO to rectify this anger (hint: more bombings and killings are not helping the situation, only making it much much much worse).
•@""(I'm going to continue posting this until someone replies that they picked it up... hopefully whoever lost it sees this!)"" Um what if they picked up their stuff at lost and found but they don't read eagle rants. Just sayin...
•I hope the person who ranted ""finally free. you held me down for far too long"" was not my ex-boyfriend. I hope that was not how you felt about our relationship because I thought it was pretty great
•When we first met, I was 100% positive you were gay...Then we became friends and I learned you are straight. I'm still waiting for the day you realize you're gay.....
•@join AUCR's and try to make that more prevalent on campus but please do not create this club” Are you serious here? The college republicans disgust me. I identify as libertarian. But I would totally join the conservative feminist group because women’s initiative doesn’t actually accomplish any substantive policy that would help women. Maybe the conservative group would.
•People say the anonymity of the internet brings out the worst in people. But I couldn’t disagree more. Anonymous eagle rants are so full of support for others and concern for helping our community. It really warms my heart when strangers reach out to ne another. Anonymity is totally awesome. (Or maybe the editor is filtering 10 nasty mean rants for every nice rant that is posted. Hmmm)
[Editor's notes: This editor filters the extremely mean, curse-filled, racist, hateful, etc. Rants.]
•@lost and found ranter: Why don’t you just go to lost and found and ask if someone picked up what you dropped off?
•What does FTL mean? Can we PLEASE stop making up acronyms. K thanks.
•@liberal housewife after college: Me too! Why does everyone assume housewives have to be conservative?  So annoying.  I plan on adopting very liberal parenting methods for my kids and cooking organic vegan meals every night. Yay liberal housewives!
•It’s I’m an idiot WHO likes boys, not THAT likes boys. Do we really need to go over this basic grammar concept yet again?
•So conservative women don’t like the abortion stuff, and liberal women want women to be able to not have to worry about getting pregnant. So can we all just rally together around making birth control more accessible? This leads to fewer abortions (which should make the conservatives happy) and more ability to plan one’s own timing of when to start a family (which should make liberals happy). Do we have a deal?
•@where do Au students go to party? : Sorry, AU students have better things to do than play beer pong. We’re out saving the world. What are you doing?
•My word search was defective. Not cool. Not cool.
•How few calories does one have to consume before one has an eating disorder? -scared I may be anorexic
•So I pooped at my boyfriend's apartment and forgot to flush the toilet. He definitely saw. How do I fix the awkwardness?
•Question for women who don’t believe in legal abortion : Do you just sit around wishing that women will stop having abortions or do you actually think about how to rectify the situation, like having over the counter birth control pills so women who don’t want to be pregnant never end up getting pregnant in the first place (and therefore will not need abortions).  This is a serious question, and I would love an answer from a conservative female who opposes legal abortion.
•Remember the time Gary Johnson came to AU? That made my life. Gary Johnson 2012! No more foreign wars. Fixing the deficit by legalizing and taxing marijuana. Marriage equality. Where is all the AU support for this socially tolerant and fiscally conservative presidential candidate? You know he is going to win right?
•Can we really not choose who we fall in love with? This has to be an urban myth. TELL ME THIS IS JUST A MYTH?
•If you were my girlfriend,
I'd respect you absolutely.
I'd protect but not cage you.
I'd write poetry about you, even if you weren't around to hear it.
I'd dance with you into the wee hours of the night.
I'd make you laugh without trying.
But you are not my girlfriend.
You're the girlfriend of the guy who just called me ""broseph"" and told me how hard he was going to ""tap that"". Such is life.
•One day I'll like someone I agree with politically, but apparently that day is not today.
•I hate phone interviews!!! I hate them!! I hate all kinds of interviews!!!! Waaahh!! Can't we just, like, I duno, pretend that my resume says EVERYTHING about me, and leave it at that??? gughhghgh so nervous!
•To the absolute moron who is cheating on his beautiful girlfriend: I'm on to you. The only reason I'm not going to kick your ugly rear from here to Japan is because I know you're getting busy with another guy. I would never out you to the world, but I swear to science if you don't own up to your girlfriend about what you're doing...
•Guys at this school need to learn that ""jokes"" about sexual assault and harassment just aren't okay. Joking about something this serious makes it seem like it is not as big an issue as it is. I was involved in a sexual harassment case recently, and it is just wrong for someone to make my situation seem more okay for the perpetrators through ""jokes"".  It's not funny, and it's not okay to say these things.
•Look over there!
Look over there!
Somebody loves you THAT much!
•@feminist who doesn't support abortion. You're allowed to not like or want an abortion. The inherently anti feminist thing would be if you were acting to take away the rights of OTHER women to not get abortions. Wanting equal pay and equal rights is fine and dandy and feminist but infringing on the rights of other women to do what they want with their bodies is wrong.
•@AU feminists encourage promiscuity (there are lots of you).
I'm pretty sure they don't encourage it as a one size fits all. They encourage it for those who feel comfortable because, growing up, everything you hear is that having sex makes you damaged goods or a bad person. they encourage people to embrace their sexuality as something to not be ashamed of. It's not for everyone, but it's empowering to know that there is that option for people who want it
•@basic rules of economics.
here's the big problem. I'm a WOMAN, a PERSON, not a GOOD OR A SERVICE. bite me.
•CORRELATION DOES NOT PROVE CAUSATION. You cannot say that sexually ""promiscuous"" women have higher rates of depression because they are promiscuous. There's an association, yes, but to assume that sleeping with higher-than-average numbers of men CAUSES depression is a huge leap that neither you nor science can make.
•I wish real life worked like facebook, where each person walks around with a friend button I can click on. There's so many interesting people I could be friends with if I weren't so awkward :(
•That awkward moment when you go to a party full of alumni who have been called by the phonathon and have to defend the phonathon and its workers to them...
•Long Islanders, please join me in prayer for everyone dealing with the brush fire back home. My heart goes out to everyone, and I hope that by the time this is posted, it will be quelled and there will not be too much damage.
•This eagle rant does not exist.
•All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
All men are Socrates.
•To the 25 year old girl with no close female friends: I'm also 25 and have no close female friends. Just know you aren't alone!
•Stop posting paragraph-long rants that are more thought out arguments than rants...
•And we would all go down together
We said we'd all go down together
Yes we would all go down together
•People can hate all they want on TDR, but their mashed potatoes last night were DREAMY.
•What about military doctors? What about service people who get their MD's? I just blew your minds ranters
•Who just posted some TS Eliot? ...I love you.
•what's the point of take back the night?
[Editor's note: ""Take Back the Night seeks to end sexual violence in all its forms including sexual assault, sexual abuse, dating violence, and domestic violence ... Take Back the Night's goal is to create safe communities and respectful relationships through awareness events and initiatives.""]
•@Pitt Bomb Threats - I was between Pitt and AU...this is reason #1001 that I'm glad I came to AU! But I've been following it and I'm very concerned because I have a lot of friends there :/
•@Bullying Club @Editor - if I rant my e-mail to the bullying club person, and he/she rants his/her e-mail to me, would you be able to e-mail the two of us so we'd have each other's e-mails or something like that?
[Editor's note: Uhh, that's way complicated. Why not just meet up somewhere?]
•when i say i miss you i mean it. when i say i love you i mean it.
maybe we should be more than friends, but i dont know if you feel the same way :( #onemonthtoshowyouiloveyouforreals
•North Korea! Stop sending nuclear rockets in the direction of my family!!!!!!!! seriously, stop. No one will think you are cool.  Not even China.  They don't even really like you anyway.  You don't even really like you. god!
•@""condoms in the wellness center could have holes too"" It's not my logic! it's the logic of AU. now see why I'm ranting?
•Where are the lesbians on this campus?  Is there some secret underground lair that I don't know about?
•Editor...please keep editing for content. It's very disappointing scrolling through a list of boring, repetitive rants day in and day out. I very much appreciate the fact that u are not allowing certain ones, it makes it better for the rest of us :)
[Editor's note: Then this editor gets ""yelled"" at for alleged censorship...]
•To the person on the 6th floor that complained about a black male sleeping on the north lounge couch in the wee hours of sunday morning, i hope public safety comes after your ass someday. people do know him on the floor and the fact that you felt the need to report him based off of his race shows how f-ing ignorant you are. racial profiling at its best @AU!
•You see the sizes S, R, L and you think they'd be small, regular, and large. But no. The creators of tampons apparently wanna fuck with hormone-crazed women. They did the complete opposite and renamed internationally recognizes sizes to super, regular, and light. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!
•I need to stop creeping on your facebook/twitter. It makes me miserable yet I can't stop doing it. Anyone else have this problem??
•PLEASE just get up with me already, i enjoy hangingout/hookingup with you but i can't take this waiting game!!
•Why is amword so bad? I feel bad for ranting about how bad it is but the most recent issue was awful. Most of the photographs were pixelated or blurry and some of the text was illegible. Please, get your act together. This isn't even the first time this has happened.
•I have SO SO SO SO many meal swipes left. Why am I required to purchase so many????
•I promised myself not to text you too much in order to avoid looking desperate and/or creepy...But at the same time constantly refreshing Facebook chat waiting for that little green dot to pop next to your name is only slightly less stalkerish. And inevitably more frustrating.
•Lets face it. Mark Zuckerburg is the root of all evil when it comes to academic productivity
•How anybody at the Facebook offices ever get anything done is beyond me. Their stalking skills must be at ninja levels now
•I'm feeling the J. Alfred Prufrock as well.
•I thought my gay-dar was bad, but my ***hole-dar is even worse.
•Running at night is the best
•I love literature so much. I love my classes. I love everything we read, and our discussions. I just hate having to write papers SO MUCH. I've written exactly three sentences in four hours.
•My friend has been acting really out of character. She has started having casual sex. She talks about how desirable and irresistible guys find her. And she is exhibiting higher anxiety than usual. These are all symptoms of a rape victim right? Am I completely off base here?
•Look, I understand: working at the residence hall desks can be very boring business. And hey, it's always great to talk to friends if they come to visit you there. But seriously, some of you don't give a flying feather. I was struggling with a lot of things and you were of no aid. Again. At least this time I didn't spill anything, but seriously? Get your eyes off the computer screen for more than two seconds. Thanks.
•Was it a TS Eliot reference or Chocolate War reference?
•Re: feminists and sexuality.  AU feminists (and other feminists) do not promote the idea that women should be have casual sex or many sex partners.  What they promote is the idea that women CAN do those things if they want to.  Just as women CAN wait to have sex until they are married, or only have sex with people in committed relationships.  The point of feminism is that a woman's value does not stem from her sexual decisions, and that they she is no better or worse than any other person for whatever sexual decisions she chooses to make.
•@ person who posted TS Eliot: Thanks, you are getting me through bio lecture
•@everyone who explained how we can be for women but not identify with the feminist movement: YES YES YES I love you all. You're spot on. Had no idea there were more of us on campus, this is awesome =D

He will be the Kennedy Political Union’s last speaker for the year, co-sponsored by the AU College Republicans.  The event will start at 8:15 p.m.
KPU Director Alex Kreger thinks Huntsman will be a good speaker because he was so recently in the national spotlight.
Huntsman dropped out of the Republican presidential primary in mid-January.  His campaign featured his daughters, who created a series of campaign videos for him. The videos were posted on their YouTube channel, Jon2012Girls.
Prior to his campaign for president, Huntsman served two terms as the governor of Utah and spent time as the American ambassador to China under President Barack Obama.
Kreger said Huntsman has some of the freshest political ideas right now and will be able to speak to Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike. 
“I think there will be a lot of excitement and people will be interested because he is a unique candidate,” she said.
Tickets are not required for the event.

2012-05-03,AU,China,"•@""Maybe think about what you’re doing to cause people to not want to be friends with you. Good luck finding more accepting people than AU students. They don’t exist."" Just because people here are accepting (which generally, yes they are), doesn't mean they're what a person is looking for in a friend. Maybe the OP just doesn't have things in common with the people they've met.



•Girl, I love you, but I have to confess that I rub my chest hairs for two hours in the morning to get the blood flowing.
•@ ""Sneak into TDR"" or ""Make out with an AU student who later comes out"" or ""Go to an 8:55 class drunk"" or ""Post an EagleRant"" ""
already did all those, haha.....

•Type your rant here!
^ Haha!
•I just kissed my best friend I'm in love with. He's leaving in 2 days. Better late than never I suppose.
•China.  That is all.
•""Good luck finding more accepting people than AU students. They don’t exist.""
So you're saying that if this person doesn't have any friends at AU, it must be because he/she is so obnoxious that even the most accepting students in the world won't put up with him or her. What a nice person you are- I'm sure you're very accepting.
•Ok, May 2nd rants sucked. 4 more days of daily rants you guys. MAKE THEM GOOD!
•@”If you've had something of yours stolen on campus, please join the Victims of Theft Facebook group (filed within American University). Together, we victims can stand up for ourselves and for justice!” That’s cute. But also sad. I’ve lost my iphone 4 times in my 4 years at AU and it has been returned to lost and found all 4 times by anonymous strangers. # reasons I love AU.
But sorry for the ranter with the lost phone? Did you have the “find my iphone” function turned on so you can GPS track it?
•Did anyone else read the New York Times ""Room for Debate"" section yesterday on the feminism versus motherhood debate? It was very fascinating. But the first columnist talking about attachment parenting and then randomly veering off into being anti-birth control talk was a disgrace. She does not represent attachment parenting. Attachment parenting is driven by science, and the science is in on birth control preventing cancer.
•What's the real difference between Salon and Slate in terms of news coverage?
•Editor, a few days ago you referred to watching summer shows this summer as a god alternative to daily eagle rants. Do you have any to recommend? Because once Desperate Housewives is over in 2 weeks, I am scared life as I know it will cease to exist.

•""Wednesday May 3rd?"" I'm just going to assume you mean today (Wednesday, May 2nd). Here goes nothing.
•So after the NESAC (the little ivies), the Patriot League (which AU is part of) is listed on college confidential multiple times under rich kid schools.  I always thought of AU as extremely economically diverse with lots of rich kids but also lots of upper middle class kids, middle class kids, and lower middle class kids who are the first in their family to go to college. I thought of Vanderbilt, Duke, Emory, Wake Forest, Richmond, and mainly southern schools as the more “rich kid” schools full of snobbery and an old money plantation type feel.  Am I wrong here?
•You're so cute and wonderful. Suddenly, everything looks and feels differently in the world and I think this may be right. I'm going to miss you so much this summer.
•Does this bagel have tarragon? Oh la la
•@""I want to respect women but I know if I do, it'll lower my value as a man in the social hierarchy of life...""
You're not looking at it correctly. Girls aren't attracted to nice guys, that's correct, but it's not because the guys are nice- it's because ""nice"" translates to ""obsequious."" Doormats aren't entertaining. On the flipside, girls really aren't attracted to straight up assholes- there's a big difference between lighthearted teasing and genuine assholery. Teasing is fun, it's the name of the game, not being a dick

•You want to talk about being a Jake and Amir fan?  I followed their personal Vimeo accounts before either one started making videos for CollegeHumor.  Originally they were both normal people, but in one early video Amir claimed to have drunk sixty beers in one night, and Jake realized that he had never been drunk at all.  They rolled with it, and Amir got crazier in every episode.
•Sometimes I wish I had regular finals... what I would give to just sit down with a book a study. But no, I'm staying up all night working on projects and trying to perfect even the tiniest of details.

2012-05-04,AU,China,"In lieu of all the dark and grim movies this summer season seems to be offering, it’s nice to see a movie that embraces escapism like “The Avengers.”
The film dives into the weird and the mystical right away with no qualms about alienating the audience. But then again, with a built-in fanbase like “The Avengers,” they have nothing to worry abut.
“The Avengers,” directed by Joss Whedon (“Serenity”) is Marvel’s biggest endeavor yet, throwing together all of Marvel’s biggest stars together in one flashy blockbuster. The star-studded list includes Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr., “Tropic Thunder), Thor (Chris Hemsworth, “Thor”), Captain America (Chris Evans, “The Losers”), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, “We Bought a Zoo”), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, “The Kids Are All Right”) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner, “Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol”).
Needless to say, there are a lot of characters, not to mention strong personalities, to keep in harmony in one film.
However, as director and co-screenwriter, Whedon does a tremendous job. The dialogue is snappy, the banter is witty, and each character gets their moment to shine in the sun. Yes, even Hawkeye.
The film’s plot itself is pretty simple, with the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D losing a precious item, the Cosmic Cube, to this movie’s Big Bad, Loki (Tom Hiddleston, “War Horse”). As a great source of energy, this Cube has the ability to make or break the world, as per usual for a deus ex machina device. Director of S.H.I.E.L.D Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, “The Other Guys”), in a desperate attempt to gain back the Cube, calls on this world’s only superheroes. The only thing is, they all hate each other.
Whedon does an excellent job of weaving together the intricacies of having such dynamic characters meet and interact. Each character gets their own hero shot along with a grand entrance, building anticipation for all the fans in the audience. However, by making them all interact in a very hostile way, Whedon builds the way for character development and team struggles, a conflict that he has crafted so well before with television series like “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Firefly.” However, Whedon is not only a master weaving together a team, but a master of dialogue.
The dialogue is probably the strongest part of “The Avengers.” The lines are fast, funny and full of exposition, allowing way more rooms for laughs than one would initially expect. Downey Jr. excels in Whedon’s trademark snark, rattling off punch line after punch line. As Black Widow, Johansson gets to break free from the stiff characterization of her character in “Iron Man 2,” reveling in her witty and comic lines. The film even pokes fun at its own characters, making it quite a meta and pop culture-saturated film, something Whedon is well-known for.
The high-energy dialogue supports the nonstop action of the film, which is perhaps one of its low points. Though “The Avengers” is a blockbuster and a superhero film with certain expectations, it often felt like the movie was composed of action sequence after action sequence, punctuated by a few select moments of exposition. While the action scenes were magnificently flashy and they flow very smoothly, it caused the plot of the film to move along rather slowly.
However, this being a Whedon film, it’s not so much the plot that matters as the characters. Despite most of the film being a snarkfest between the main characters, the stars clearly had a lot of chemistry with each other, and you found yourself rooting for them to work together. Even the supporting characters played their part, such as the lovably deadpan Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg, “Mr. Popper’s Penguins”), who acted as a sort of emotional link between all the characters’ films. Of course, since Whedon is behind the helm, one of these characters to whom you’ve grown so attached has to die so that Whedon can rip out your heart and stomp on it on the ground.
Despite the jumble of elements that hold together this film, it works. “The Avengers” could have easily slipped into dangerous Michael Bay territory with its wealth of aliens and science fiction, but it was grounded by the dynamic characters and masterful dialogue. It’s not a perfect movie, but it is a great superhero movie.

2012-05-04,AU,China,"•@ ""Dafuq is wrong with you?""
As an American, I'd like to invade Dafuq tomorrow. They stole our Cheese Nips.



•RAWRRR. I planned Thursday to be silent and roommate-free so I can finish my huge paper. Except it sounds like my neighbor's shower tiles are being replaced one by one and there's SO MUCH BANGING AND LOUD NOISES.
•""These didn't used to be so low"" -Carl Saggin'
•@""Why is the final schedule so cruel?"" Because if every class started its final on-time, then 4:00pm class finals would go until 6:30pm, thus messing up 5:30 classes for everyone. Hey wait, that's not such a bad idea...
•I don't give a fuchsia about you!
•Huzzah for those Carl Sagan rants!
•Update: the deafening construction on my neighbor's bathtub stopped almost immediately after I sent in that rant. Eagle Rants, you have magical magical powers.
•Ugh, I'm already antsy to get my grades posted already.
•My neighbor is loud, annoying, and rude at all hours of the day. I hope he moves or drops out. I would add ""graduates"" to that list but since he apparently never does any homework, I don't think that's a possibility.
•Wish I could just have a hook up for finals week, I need some way to get rid of all this stress
•Editor- I don't understand why you can't get the message to STOP CENSORING rants. If people have comments about Sarah McBride, and they're not obscene, by your own rules, you have to publish them. She's a public figure and like it or not, people have a right to express their opinions. If she didn't want the criticism, she shouldn't have published in the Eagle. You guys published it, you have to allow ALL sides of commentary.
[Editor's note: Hateful Rants will not be published. See Rants rules.]
•@fruit sharer: you made my day
•NANTS INGONYAMA BAGITHI BABA!
•@”Even the Texas Rangers who she claims to have helped deny working with her.” Are you seriously using this as your evidence? NO ONE she works with is allowed to confirm that she worked with them. Evidence discovered through a psychic is not admissible in court because we don’t yet understand the science behind it, so the police have to say that they found the evidence on a hunch via good police work. Are you really that clueless?
•@”And its very convenient that she can't do it on command isn't it?” Ya, it’s convenient that you can’t dream on command either. You must be lying whenever you talk about your dreams. Just because you don’t understand the neuroscience behind what she does doesn’t mean that she is faking it. People said the same thing about the first scientist who said that washing hands before delving babies would prevent more babies dying from infections. Why is it impossible to think there could be mind germ or mind DNA that we haven’t yet discovered?
•Can we vote to change the once a week summer rants? Is there any way the new editor will change his/her mind and decide to do daily rants? I can't take the weekly suspense! And it hasn't even started!
•@”Actually, the person harassing me started harassing my friends as well so I stepped back to protect them, and now because of this person and their friends I'm afraid to go out on campus except for class.” Why can’t you just ignore this person? I doubt AU has bullies who would follow you around harassing you. But if there is one, have you told your RA or campus security? PS Sorry for your situation.
•I can't wait to see my LDR bf either. That sense of peace knowing you will see him is wonderful. But I have to wait 6 more weeks. :(
•@”It's people like you that make people afraid of the gym.” People WHO, not people THAT.
•@”Maybe the OP just doesn't have things in common with the people they've met.” Assuming the rant was not jointly written by two friendless people, the plural pronoun “they’ve” does not go with the singular noun “OP”.  You’re welcome.
•I don't wanna leave AU next week!
•@”@ Chick who tried to give me an HJ. Don't try to perfect what I already have. You'll just embarrass yourself.” Curious, how does one perfect a penis with a HJ?  Is it through really tight squeezing and then it just morphs shape like play dough? jw…
•@obsequious guys rant: Personally I like having an obsequious guy who wants to be my slave. ;)
•@ “Thanks AU...for one more year of horribly overpriced food and limited dining options.” You do realize AU was voted best vegetarian and vegan food for any college in the country right? AU food is great. Stop being a snob. Sorry you don’t have a personal chef following you around.
•@""Can we revoke the campus plan?""
-DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!
-Your license has just been revoked.
•ONE INCH. ONE FREAKING INCH. What kind of sick human being forces a sleep-deprived, hopeless college student to remount a project because the illustration board is ONE INCH too short.
•Dear Editor, Dorm ? Res. Hall
•I respond well to jerks
•It is me, the AU Vigilante. I am here to give my only warning to those who seek to take advantage of the drunk and vulnerable. Starting this summer and next semester I will be doing safe walk backs, quad patrols and other activities to ensure people are safe on this campus and the surrounding area 24/7. I will also create a system in which anyone can reach me if they ever feel unsafe. You may not see me, but you will feel my presence fighting evil on this campus. Vigilante Out
•Hope is not lost. Faith is not broken. The Vigilante lives
•can we make war against all the biddies?
•I do like you, I really do, but some things about you I really dont like.
•IF YOU SAY GDI AGAIN IMMA PUNCH YOU IN DA FACE <3
•Why do I bother playing support if my carry is just going to end up rushing a black cleaver and a warmogs.  LoL fans will know what I mean.  So many bad AD carries.
•I wish I hadn't wasted so much time in the beginning of the semester trying to be friends with one group of people.  I feel like I missed out on making other friends who I would have clicked with better.  I feel like it'll be harder to start up friendships as a sophomore than it was at the beginning of freshman year.
•I really don't want to have a big wedding with lots of people. Large crows for extended periods of time really stress me out. I'd rather just elope. But I know my brother and sister want a big wedding party. Is it selfish or emo to elope? Btw, my bf also prefers a very low key elopement.
•I love you so much. I wish I could give you your love language, but in this situation I cannot.
•Atlantic > Slate + Salon
•I wish eagle would allow anonymous commenting on the articles again like they used to a few years ago. It really sucks how now the articles don't have any comments. But I guess I'll just have to suffice with commenting on articles via eagle rants.
[Editor's note: Our comment system changed, making comments no longer anonymous. You can always make up a username.]
•Taking a shot of whiskey right before my exam today = best finals choice I've made yet.
•The only reason I really want to know your sexual preference is because I think you're dating potential. I know it's technically not my business and that you have every right not to make it public, but I really am curious. Unfortunately, it would be extremely odd to ask, so I'm left trying to figure it out with very little clues.
•@That’s cute. But also sad. I’ve lost my iphone 4 times in my 4 years at AU and it has been returned to lost and found all 4 times by anonymous strangers. # reasons I love AU.
You were lucky. Most of us have not. My experience has made me a lot less naive and willing to trust random AU kids to look out for my best interest. Someday you may lose your iPhone and it simply won't come back. Then you'll get the point.
•@""Hahaha, here that nice guy? One girl says sure you can be sloppy seconds after she has stopped whoring herself out, and the other ""I like nice guys"" but am a complete ditz. Screw em' acquire capital.""
^this guy is a moron and a douchebag. Don't listen to him.  I mean, come on- he used the wrong type of ""hear"". That's failing at basic middle school grammar.
•@ ""I don't care that girls think the straight men at AU are ugly and nerdy. I've always had good luck."" Amen, sister!
•@ ""I am 23 years old, have never had a girlfriend, and I am a misanthrope. Yes, I am a proud product of AU."" Are you from NJ and smoke a lot of weed? If so, I think I know you...
•I know. And if I seem like a b***h sometimes, it's because I don't want to give you the wrong impression.
•""Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known"" -Carl Sagan
•I want Finals week to be renamed ""Student Deathmatch Super Fun Time Week.""
•I know it's messed up but a part of me hopes you fail your ivy league finals and drop out so that we can be near each other again. I'm dying of loneliness.
#sorrynotsorry
•I love AU. I have had the best years of my life here and am glad that I won't have a single regret when I leave. #sucked the juice out of college and had the most enriching years of my life
•Let's play a game called ""If I didn't go to AU, I would be at x college."" I'll go first. If I didn't go to AU, I would be at University of Florida. So glad I came to AU.
•Im sorry but the DG salute looks absolutely stupid in all of your facebook pictures
•We can debate whether or not gym class heros was good all day long, but as long as AU continues to neglect the need for a big, campus wide outdoor music festival with a name like ""spring fling"" or whatever we're never going to have any campus-wide musical unity. Its sad that the best concert Ive been to this year was at GW.
•The reason I'm failing all my finals: Tetris Battle on facebook. Ack!
•Being unavailable is temporary until she's wearing a ring.  Do you seen one on me? Don't count me out yet.
•Here's how I rate The Eagle! F!!!!! Stop trying to be sensationalist and maybe you won't be sued
•CAUS and CASJ...shut up! No one cares what you have to say! If you don't like it here go to another school!
•President McBride wasn't present at enough events? Are you serious Eagle? You ""reporters"" need to come out of your cubby hole because McBride was everywhere.
•Hey Eagle reporters....get over yourself! You're not The New York Times or The Washington Post...Thanks!
•Hey Eagle...SG Senate got Gender Neutral Housing on campus #giveussomefreakingcredit
•SO MUCH SEX! YAY
•SG does not have a problem with inclusion! Stop making us seem like we are the Antichrist

•What does YOLO mean?
•Alright, Sarah McBride and those who obsess over her, I am very supportive of her but her attention is getting really annoying. We get it, you've been picked up by Gaga and HRC. I hope she remembers where she comes from. Also, her op ed was not necessary. Again, totally supportive, but her need for attention makes me gag.
•The ""call me maybe"" video, yeah, was that filmed on campus?
•I just overheard a girl ask who Tim McBride was... really, a whole year at AU and you don't know who he is?
•Eastbound and Down, baby.
•Peace to the homeboy Yangmo Ku. Keep ya head up, dawg.
•It won't be worth it without you.
•I never want to come back from Russia.
•the only time I go to breakfast at TDR is when I pull all nighters in the library- another punishment for staying up all night. am I the only one who thinks TDR breakfast sucks?
•To the girl constantly posting about how much she hates her roommate and how she is in love with her best friend who already transferred, hi. This is your roommate. Want to have an adult discussion? I'm not going to get upset; I've heard it all before. Might as well clear the air because we are only living together for four more days.

[Editor's note: Sorry! This editor is posting Rants from downtown at D.C. Superior Court in between covering murder cases.]
•Look, I just got accepted to AU a couple weeks ago. I’m just an average guy. I like sports and DVDs, but I’m worried the AU community won’t accept me because I’m “different.” You see, I was born with Werewolf Syndrome. My whole family’s got it for crying out loud! Before I enroll, I wanna hear what the AU community has to say about this.
•People here are so shallow Here!!  I have a micro pene. Ok there, I said it! Why can’t someone just give me a shot.
•The Incubator has just died.

2012-06-01,AU,China,"“Snow White and the Huntsman” has all the elements of a good medieval fantasy movie: a richly imagined world, breathtaking CGI, a dazzlingly good-looking cast. Only there’s something off.
It may be the soulless “acting” of Kristen Stewart. It may be the stilted, awkward dialogue. But it probably was that “Snow White and the Huntsman” tried to be the best interpretation of the classic fairytale to ever exist, only to fall a bit short.
The movie invests a lot in how it looks, spending much time on sweeping shots of the bleakly majestic countryside and slowing down the magic-filled CGI scenes as much as possible without looking too tawdry. Even the soundtrack makes an obvious effort to be as epic and grandiose as possible. And it works, at least for the first 45 minutes.
The story begins simply enough, with a prelude dictating the fall of the king (Noah Huntley, “Your Highness”) and Snow White (Kristen Stewart, “Twilight”) by the hands of the beautifully vicious Ravenna (Charlize Theron, “Young Adult”). After years of imprisonment, Snow White escapes, only to get lost in The Dark Forest, forcing Ravenna and her creepy brother (Sam Spruell, “Defiance”) to hire the titular Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth, “Thor”) to track her down. However, the Huntsman instead decides to aid her in her fight against the Ravenna.
Seems like a simple enough plot, right? Well, it seems the movie thought so too, and decided to spice things up with a few more subplots. “Snow White and the Hunstman” seems to pick up as many subplots as possible, including a magical destiny and a messy love triangle involving William (Sam Claflin, “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides”), a childhood friend of Snow White’s, both of which are unceremoniously dropped in favor of a huge battle scene. The overabundance of subplots weigh down the film, not to mention their lack of resolution.
If the subplots weren’t enough, there is many a plot hole and deus ex machina device in this movie. Many of which the film does not explain, opting instead to distract us with yet another beautiful scene of CGI magic. The hallucination scenes are indeed gorgeous, though.
As much fun as it is to rave about the excellent CGI, the actors aren’t to be overlooked. Theron is magnificent — albeit a bit one-note — as a vain woman driven power-mad by paranoia. She snarls and struts her way through her role but still manages to act circles around Stewart.
In fact, everyone acts circles around Stewart. The poor girl seems to have little talent for the wide-eyed vulnerability that the role seems to call for, looking instead like she’s posing for a magazine photo shoot in each shot. There’s no denying that Stewart is beautiful, but her limited acting ability makes it hard to see Snow White as a character rather than a plot device.
Hemsworth provides the gravitas and angst required for this movie, playing the Hunstman as a roguish brute with a heart of gold and a traumatic past. It was relieving to have him play a larger part in the film, as Snow White’s other love interest, played by Orlando Bloom look-a-like Claflin, does little other than look vaguely handsome and shoot off a couple of arrows.
“Snow White and the Huntsman” is an enjoyable medieval fantasy movie, especially if you’re up for ignoring gaping plot holes and a miscast main actress. If not, you can always re-watch “Game of Thrones.”

2012-09-13,AU,China,"The Bánh mì was impeccable: crunchy daikon, savory beef and sweet plus acidic chili-lime mayo combined to create something that was magically foreign, but comfortably local. On a hot Friday afternoon, Navy Yard filled with four-wheeled ambassadors. My tongue could travel halfway across the world with 10 steps to my left or to my right, and it was easy to get lost amongst the tacos, hoagies, gelati, empanadas and curries at Truckeroo.
Beyond the smells, tastes and sounds of orders being yelled to truck-based culinary conductors, there is a history. Bánh mì dates back to French colonial involvement in Vietnam (then Indochina) in the 19th century. Combining the distinctively French baguette with rice-powder and Vietnamese meats, sauces and sides led to the birth of a sandwich that fused two cultures from opposite sides of the world, the result of a colonial empire.
Natives of D.C. will rave about the vibrant Ethiopian food, and many have sampled wot, injera or tibs. Yet, rarely is the question asked why D.C. has the largest Ethiopian population in the United States. The answer is rooted in the USSR-supported, Ethiopian Marxist movement of the 1970s. However, the story goes beyond Cold War politics: during the diaspora of the 1970s, Ethiopians settled in areas of D.C. like Adams Morgan and U Street, which were neglected and feared after the race riots of the 1960s. The immigrant population reinvigorated these neighborhoods and helped transform them into modern-day hotspots. 
This past week launched the Diplomatic Culinary Partnership, a joint effort between the U.S. State Department and the James Beard Foundation. Eighty chefs were given the designation of State Chefs as part of the American Chef Corps (some familiar names might be Mike Isabella, Rick Bayless and José Andrés). This partnership acknowledges the importance of food in understanding and connecting the world. The culinary 21st century has been defined by a recognition and admiration of local, ethnic and cultural foods. Never before have unique food cultures been embraced so openly by writers, critics, TV personalities and food blogs.
Food as diplomacy recognizes that the way to a person’s heart is through their stomach. Culinary ambassadors can connect the United States with individual from around the world through what is perhaps the oldest diplomatic tool. Food is universal, but also something that is unique to different countries, ethnic groups and religions. Understanding a culture’s food is essential to understanding the culture as a whole.
Food is more than just Yelp! reviews or Instagram photos. Food in D.C. is defined by not just cross-cultural collaboration and Americanization, but also ethnic independence. Culinary ambassadors are the first steps in understanding the world beyond GDP, political brinksmanship and the basic theories of international relations. The story behind the food, the story that connects us to different cultures, is almost as amazing as the sweet, spicy and savory Bánh mì at Truckeroo on a hot Friday afternoon.

2012-10-12,AU,China,"After wallowing for years as the bland leading man in a series of formulaic Hollywood efforts, Ben Affleck has recently re-established himself as a reputable director with ambitious, well-received pieces like “Gone Baby Gone” and “The Town.”
Affleck demonstrates his newly acquired talents with “Argo,” a sophisticated, taut suspense drama that employs real-life events to simultaneously exhilarate the audience and tweak Affleck’s beloved film industry. Likely to be a contender for several Academy Awards, “Argo” is gripping but not overly serious, smart but not overly complex, well-paced but not overlong. It’s just right.
The film begins in 1979 Iran, detailing relevant history through subtle animation. A stunning first sequence depicts an intense frenzy as Iranian protesters infiltrate the American embassy and take 52 Americans hostage. Six of the Americans manage to escape the Iranians’ clutches and find temporary refuge in the Canadian Embassy, but to leave from there would be to endanger their lives.
Back in D.C., CIA specialist Tony Mendez (Affleck) devises a risky and outlandish scheme to smuggle the hidden ambassadors out of militant Iran with minimum suspicion. With the help of Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman, “Trouble with the Curve”) and legendary producer Lester Siegel (a hilariously dry Alan Arkin, “The Muppets”), Mendez constructs the trappings of a fake science-fiction film called “Argo” and travels to Iran, where he hopes to transport the hostages disguised as a film crew.
“Argo” avoids many of the pitfalls of lesser thrillers. Its focus is tight, with no extraneous subplots to distract from the driving rescue narrative. The process-oriented script by Chris Terrio ignores melodramatic tendencies to focus on the simple problem of how best to retrieve the hostages, detailing necessary machinations like trade publications, script readings and publicity. Such buildup amplifies the power of the later, more action-oriented section.
The dialogue is sharp, with witticisms about the movie industry and Melendez’s drinking habits drawing surprisingly cathartic laughs amidst the pervasive tension. Affleck seems to be simultaneously mocking and celebrating his own industry, lampooning its tendency to produce schlocky science-fiction and foster unjustified egos while reinforcing the idea that movies, frivolous as they often seem, can make an impact.
The cast is superb. Affleck proves to be a capable (if not earth-shattering) lead, understated as a man who excels at his job even as his colleagues doubt him. Bryan Cranston’s intensity from “Breaking Bad” translates seamlessly into his role as Mendez’s boss, a man whose patience quickly wears thin. Goodman and Arkin, meanwhile, provide some of the film’s most vibrant comedic scenes; they are particularly adept at delivering several well-timed F-bombs and satirizing various Hollywood professions. 
Admittedly, “Argo” is not entirely original or even particularly surprising. The action sequences and dramatic conversations are compelling enough to offset much of the predictability, but the climax and denouement are far from shocking. Nonetheless, both pack a surprisingly emotional punch. Tony’s marital struggles, meanwhile, feel tacked on in a few obligatory scenes of Mendez moping generically, but the film’s moving conclusion and last line partially offset that unnecessary wrinkle as well. 
Affleck’s direction raises the suspense and accentuates the mood with such finesse that the relative lack of originality allows “Argo” to excel beyond conventional iterations of its genre.

2013-05-13,AU,China,"Baz Luhrmann's version of the quintessential American yarn of Jay Gatsby and his inevitable decline at the hands of the decadence and excess of the Jazz Age is a visual technicolor rhapsody.
As a director, Luhrmann can be divisive amongst moviegoers. After the questionable outing that was the arduous ""Australia,"" it's surprising to see him make a film like ""The Great Gatsby."" Although on the surface it seems gaudy and flamboyant, it has a reserved center, displaying a maturity in Luhrmann's direction. 
Luhrmann reunites with a fuller faced Leonardo DiCaprio (""Django Unchained"") 17 years after his neon fantasy version of ""Romeo + Juliet."" Considering the over-the-top parties Gatsby throws, it's not hard to see how Luhrmann was attracted to F.Scott Fitzgerald's generation defining novel.
The plot of the film remains the same as the novel, though with an added embellishment. The film frames the story with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire, ""Spider Man"") as he sequesters himself into a rehab. Carraway, filled with alcohol and regrets, seeks help when his doctor suggests he write to calm his nerves. 
Recalling his memory by actually writing ""The Great Gatsby,"" Carraway retells the events of moving to West Egg, Long Island. Unknown to him, Carraway has set down next to the enigmatic Gatsby's mansion.
Eventually, Gatsby asks Carraway if he would invite Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan, ""Drive"") for tea. Carraway, who sees this as an opportunity to show a kind gesture of friendship toward Gatsby, sets off a chain of events that lead to Gatsby's demise.
Luhrmann lets Fitzgerald's work speak for itself, knowing full well that the strength of the novel is in the power of its words.
At times, the screenwriting duo of Craig Pierce (""Moulin Rouge!"") and Luhrmann draws parallels a little too closely to the life of Fitzgerald. Luhrmann culls from Fitzgerald's life and letters in order to address the opulence that surrounds Gatsby's world. 
The script connects the real life friendship between Ernest Hemingway and Fitzgerald by fictionalizing it in the Hemingway-esque character of Tom Buchanan, that Joel Edgerton (""The Thing"") plays as a booming brute, and deconstructing Fitzgerald's personality between Carraway and Gatsby. This tenuous relationship eventually coalesces into an explosive confrontation over Daisy.
DiCaprio's performance as the golden haired midwestern boy who struck it big and eventually retreated to his empire of extravagance is more humanizing than Robert Redford's performance in Jack Clayton's version of ""The Great Gatsby."" Redford was at the pinnacle of his golden boy persona but was icy and too reserved. Dicaprio finds Gatsby's emotional core and exerts it for all its delirious net worth.
The weakest link, though, is unfortunately the source of Gatsby's obsession. Mulligan simply doesn't embody the character of Daisy well enough to make the audience believe that Gatsby would dedicate his life to resurrecting the past in order to blaze a future for them. Compared with Mia Farrow's performance in the aforementioned Clayton version, with her sharpened cheekbones, and a voice that literally sounded ""full of money,"" as Fitzgerald described, in Farrow the audience believed that a man would go to great lengths to win her over. In Mulligan, we do not.
It's also evident that much care went into recreating 1920's New York. From Simon Duggan's slick, expressive cinematography to Jay-Z's curated soundtrack, production design by Luhrmann's wife, Catherine Martin, and an evocative score by Craig Armstrong, the set becomes fevered, but believable. Luhrmann ties it together with references to films such as Alexander Mackendrick's ""Sweet Smell of Success"" to Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard.""
Much ballyhoo has been made about the 3D element, which seems like a novel idea at first. But the limits of the technology are evident. Blurry shots and unfocused backgrounds make the picture fall flat.
Luhrmann and Piece's script tries to fit in as many motifs of the original novel as possible, including the eyes of doctor T.J. Eckelberg hovering over the fiery expanse between New York and West Egg. Luhrmann also includes the troubled relationship between Myrtle and her husband George Wilson, played by Isla Fisher (""Rango"") and Jason Clarke (""Zero Dark Thirty""), respectively. 
But the film attempts to fit in as much as possible. At a hefty 143 minutes, it feels muddled at times.
Suppose Luhrmann was intrigued by Fitzgerald's novel the same way he was attracted to Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet."" Parallels between the two narratives unhinge at the limits of the character's grasp of control. The machinations of a few small acts condemn both Romeo and Gatsby to their death. 
Though ""Romeo and Juliet "" was a tragedy about the irrationality of youth, Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" is about the projection of hope and the eventual victims of excessive hubris. Our hopes remain out of our grasp, like Gatsby's silhouette trapped looking across the Long Island sound upon that shimmering green light. 
We, too, are borne back, ceaselessly into the past.

2014-02-12,AU,China,"The Chosun bowl at Sakuramen.
As diners stroll by Adams Morgan’s most popular shops and restaurants, they can hear loud music from Madam’s Organ, smooth jazz from Tryst and hip-hop throwbacks from an underground ramen bar. 
That last adage might sound out of place. A ramen bar has Aaliyah, Wu-Tang Clan and pre-“Magna Carta Holy Grail” Jay-Z on rotation? 
That’s what Sakuramen, a ramen bar in a basement on Adams Morgan’s busy 18th Street, is all about. Walking down the steep, eroded steps into the warm bar, you can see the intentional blending of cultures, music and food. Ramen noodles are traditionally Japanese, but Sakuramen makes a note to fuse different Asian foods into the restaurant’s bowls of broth, noodles and other goodies. 
My favorite dish every time I visit, usually to impress friends from home, is the Chosun bowl. The different flavors and culinary staples from Korea, Japan and China are all apparent in the bowl. Angus bulgogi steak, seasoned boiled egg, kimchi and nori (seaweed) blend Korean and Japanese foods in a bowl without muddling the flavors. The umami flavors of the steak and boiled egg stand by themselves and at the same time balance out the broth and nori.
For adventurous eaters, try the Tonkotsu Red bowl. Boiled pork is enough for me to call this dish a stretch. For those not used to the texture, take it slow. But once you get over the naked texture of boiled pork, you realize how wonderfully flavorful it is. The Tonkotsu Red also uses pork broth and ranges from not that spicy to outrageously spicy. I always go for the spiciest of flavors offered. The Tonkotsu Red bowl tries the taste buds but not in a way that prevents diners from enjoying their food.
I consistently bring out-of-towners to Sakuramen for the great location, warm atmosphere and even better food. Unlike typical American dining, Sakuramen uses long tables where diners face each other. This is a great way to meet people and feel connected with the surroundings. If you want a more private experience, there are some smaller tables around the restaurant.
Prices are fair for the quality of food you get as well as the heap of deliciousness in your bowl. Typically, bowls range between $11-$13.
Waiters are also a plus at Sakuramen. They are as cool as the house soundtrack and nice enough to help diners who know nothing about ramen, kimchi or nori.
Next time you’re on 18th, bypass the jumbo slice and take a chance on Sakuramen.

The annual celebration of America’s declaration of independence from Britain has arrived. Whether you’re looking for a tourist attraction or an event off the beaten path, our guide to the 4th of July in D.C. has something for everyone.
Arts & Entertainment
Although the fourth is an American holiday, celebrate other cultures while you wait for the fireworks at the second week of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, from July 2-9 . This year’s spotlight is on China and Kenya, and both nations have booths filled with art, food and cultural performances all day on the National Mall. 
Speaking of the National Mall, the annual Capitol Fourth Concert will take place on the West Lawn of the Capitol and on live telivision at 8 p.m. This year’s lineup includes artists old and new, like Frankie Valli, John Williams, Phillip Phillips, Jordin Sparks and many, many more. The event is free for all attendees.
If lyrics aren’t your thing, the National Cathedral is hosting its annual Independence Day Organ Recital at 11 a.m. Hear your favorite American classics performed in one of D.C.’s largest houses of worship and ask yourself, “What is separation of church and state?”
Music
If you’ve always wondered what it would be like to be admitted to Puff Daddy’s notorious White Party, here’s your chance (sort of). The DMV’s rap and hip-hop radio station, WKYS, is hosting their Independence Day White Out party at the Howard Theatre, complete with a performance by rapper and entrepreneur Yo Gotti. Tickets are a bit pricey — between $60-100 — but if you’re looking for an alternative to the traditional fireworks scene, this party is guaranteed to be good time. Doors open at 9 p.m., with the show starting at 10:30 p.m.
Not a big fan of gangsta rap? Not a problem. The self-proclaimed “America’s best birthday party,” the USA Birthday Dance Party at the Rock and Roll Hotel appeals to your eardrums and your wallet.

Host disc jockeys The Lothario and The Clown Prince, collectively The Borrowers, promise to play your favorite electro jams. Doors open for the show at 10 p.m., right when the party is set to begin.
Another free dance party option for the 21  crowd is the Coalbox Indie Dance Party at DC9. Although this dance party goes on every Friday night, hitting up a free dance party with cheap drinks ($2!) after a hot day celebrating the good ol’ U S of A might just be exactly what you’re looking for. Doors open when the party begins, 10:30 p.m., right after the fireworks are finished.
Lifestyle
For food, music, fireworks and a good ol’ American block party, stop by the Hill Country’s Backyard Barbecue on the N*ational Building Museum’s West Lawn* from 2 to 9 p.m., where Jeremy Steding, The Slim Kings (featuring Liberty DeVitto) and Jonny Grave & the Tombstones will be performing.

2014-09-12,AU,China,"Eagle columnist Shelby Ostergaard has written an eloquent plea for AU to divest from its energy stocks (Divestment necessary for AU’s future, April 18 Eagle), but it rests on two assumptions, one unproven and the other incorrect. First, Ostergaard claims that if energy companies “burn all the oil they currently have, the temperature of the world will go up six degrees.” Then she reports that “every AU student has had, in at least one class, a discussion about climate change and the havoc that oil drilling is imposing on our planet.” 
In her first assumption, Ostergaard is simply repeating what climate modelers call “scenarios,” not even predictions, that occur when computers are run for a hundred years forward using the opaque models that have been “tuned” to replicate temperatures over the past 100 years. As someone who has guided students through the models and statistics of climate change here at AU for the past decade, I can tell your readers that the models, while fascinating in their construction, are in their infancy, both in looking backwards and in looking forwards. They certainly have misfired badly over the past 15 years, predicting one of those degrees of temperature rise but seeing, in reality, absolute zero. 
In her second assumption, Ostergaard appears to misunderstand the nature of instruction. Of course we professors introduce issues relating to claims of “climate change” but not to impose on our students a belief that oil drilling creates “havoc.” We certainly hope that students will form an opinion, based on the way we have taught them to analyze evidence for themselves, about whether it was more likely natural fluctuation or industrial gas that caused the one degree rise in temperature from 1860 to 2000, and whether that one degree rise has led to havoc in hurricanes, droughts and sea level rise. But the data are weak on all of these questions, and it is not our job to make those judgments for them. Similarly, the University as a whole is not able to decide these difficult and uncertain scientific questions, and so should not be choosing stocks on the basis of allegations of “climate change.” The same holds true for hydraulic “fracking,” to which Ostergaard is so opposed. The trade-offs between the environmental risks and the economic payoffs are many and varied, and should be decided by elected politicians, not appointed academics. 
As someone who also teaches African politics, I would argue that even if the scariest climate change scenarios come true, there is a strong moral argument for not applying divestment to energy companies working in Africa. I am a great believer in divestment as a tactic in achieving social justice. I worked on the anti-apartheid divestment campaign both in college and as a staffer in Congress. But this time, divestment will harm, not help, Africans. 
A successful divestment campaign would be a death sentence for African economic development and millions of Africans. Like many other areas in the developing world, Africa has not achieved the carbon-based industrialization that has boosted education, comfort, income and life expectancy to record levels in the developed world. Even if Africa did make the leap, it would still account for only about 5 percent of global emissions. America’s per person emissions are 20 times higher. 
African economic development is being derailed by a lack of reliable consumer and industrial electricity. According to the World Bank, only 24 percent of Africans have access to electricity, which is being denied them on the basis of the supposed environmental dangers of electricity.  The rest must resort to burning dung and wood in their houses and huts, leading to horrific rates of lung and heart disease.
The typical African business loses power 56 days each year, severely constraining investment and output in commerce, agriculture, education and industry. Growth suffers, and because wealth allows people to live healthily, so does life expectancy. Energy poverty is stunting the sort of economic growth that Africa needs if it is to move from 59 years of life expectancy to the 79 that China has achieved through 20 years of economic growth fueled by intense, government-backed promotion of carbon-based electrical capacity. With almost a billion Africans alive today, that is about 20 billion years of life lost. 
As it was under apartheid, so it is for energy now: it is for the Africans, not the West, to decide.  They wanted freedom then, and they want reliable electricity now. There is a right to development just like there is a right to democracy. Let’s listen to Africans’ voices as they call for 100 percent access to electricity. Let’s envision the children sitting in their huts as deadly wood smoke swirls around them, with the fire too dim for them to read their homework assignments. Please, AU, let’s divest from the call for energy divestment.

2014-10-13,AU,China,"Gaining access to international cinema can be a challenge. Films are frequently rare or out of print, and copyright issues occasionally prevent them from being seen at all outside of their host country. But beginning this semester, samples of world cinema are coming straight to campus and anyone can see them at no cost.
The International Cinema Series – a multi-year program sponsored by AU, the National Gallery of Art and several embassies – began in late September with a quartet of Italian films. Each film is carefully selected based on its cultural significance or simply because it is a never-before-seen gem. 
The Italian series featured an especially unique blend: two classic films and two contemporary films, each offering its own portrait of lifestyles throughout the country’s history.
International films are different from domestic films in several ways, according to Sharon Metcalf, senior director of Strategic Partnerships and Programs in the School of Communication. 
“The foreign films unfold at a different pace, but there’s nothing like film to give you the perspective of day-to-day life,” Metcalf said.
This will be especially evident in the next series of films, beginning Oct. 17. Four documentary features, all made in China, will receive screenings, and one of them (“Nostalgia – The Ballade of Village”) will receive its U.S. premiere. Each film presents a glimpse into the lives of Chinese citizens in both rural and urban locations.
November will feature films created in the Czech Republic, and in December viewers will travel to Greece.
Each screening is preceded by a brief discussion in which speakers offer introductory remarks. “Il Sorpasso”, one of the Italian films, featured opening statements from SOC Dean Emeritus and Film and Media Arts professor Larry Kirkman, as well as Michele Giacalone, public relations officer for the Italian Cultural Institute. 
“It’s very enriching for viewers to have that context and appreciate some of the nuances of the film that they might not have been otherwise aware of,” Metcalf said.
Audiences at the International Cinema Series so far have included Gallery members, film aficionados, AU students and staff, diplomats and many more. 
The International Cinema Series takes place in the Malsi Doyle and Michael Forman Theater in the McKinley Building. A full schedule is available online at american.edu/nga Cinema Series.

I go places by myself at night that I definitely shouldn’t (don’t tell my parents), and I have never once felt unsafe. 
Recently I watched a documentary on rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo in my sociology class. I watched as women recounted being raped by groups of men, brutalized, sodomized with branches and the barrels of guns. These women often develop fistulas due to the tearing of their vaginal and uterine walls. They are left incontinent. Social pariahs unable to care for themselves and their children. In Congolese society, being raped is often a social death-sentence.  
I walked out of my class at 1:00 p.m. feeling ill. I needed to get off campus. My favorite pho truck was parked on 7th and G Street so I made my way to Chinatown. I got off the metro and headed towards a row of food trucks when suddenly a man grabbed me by the hand. His grasp was so firm that I thought he had broken my bone. 
“Hey, what’s your name?” he said.
“Hi...I’m sorry I have to go,” I managed to stumble out. 
I tried to keep walking but I was jerked back with force. He wouldn’t let go. He pulled me closer to him and put his other arm around my waist. He smelled like grease.
I started to panic. I was practically screaming, pleading with him to let me go but he was steadfast in his grip. About a hundred people were watching, but no one did anything.        I began to cry, he softened his hold on me for an instant and I bolted. I ran up to a group of businessmen and pretended to answer a phone call as my assailant calmly strode away. These men had seen what had happened but none of them said a word to me. 
In a daze, I ordered my beef pho and sat on the side steps of the National Portrait Gallery. Everyone was staring at me. They had all watched from their perch as one of the scariest moments of my life unfolded like it was some sort of Aeschylean drama, and now they watched me cry over a Styrofoam bowl of soup. I felt like some sort of modern Blanche DuBois facsimile, listless in high-waisted shorts and a striped sweater as my Stanley faded into the crowd. 
The reality is that I am considered “lucky.” I was not raped, I was not severely beaten and I have incurred no fistulas. My experience today was incredibly scary, but there will be no lasting damage. But does that make it okay? Is it acceptable that this man was allowed to walk right up to me and make me so afraid that I later cried and vomited in front of my favorite art exhibit? 
I am not afraid of men. I will continue to walk by myself whenever I damn well please. I will not be afraid of what’s lurking in the shadows. I am terrified, however, of anyone who says that he or she hates feminism. Anyone who thinks that women seeking to live in a world where being grabbed on the street isn’t considered “lucky” is some sort of an affront to men. Anyone who thinks that feminism is about women wanting to have their cake and eat it, too. Anyone who can deny that women disproportionately bear the brunt of poverty and conflict.   Anyone who can acknowledge that women face rape, genital mutilation and sexual humiliation as a product of war and still ask, “But what about men?” 
Equality is not a zero-sum game. By increasing the rights of women, nothing is taken away from the rights of men. By advocating for equal pay in this country and equal access to education in another, men do not suffer. The consequence of feminist success is not a militant-lesbian hegemony in which all bras are burned and men become untouchables. The consequence of feminist success is progress.

2015-05-08,AU,China,"Songbyrd Record Cafe, a new restaurant in Adams Morgan, offers its customers the opportunity to record their own vinyl records, all while consuming delicious cafe food. Created by Alisha Edmonson and Joe Lapan, the cafe is a gem for foodies and music lovers alike.

	Edmonson and Lapan named the cafe after Charlie Byrd, the famous 60s jazz and Bossa Nova mixer. The restaurant sits in the same location where Byrd supposedly conjured up the inspiration for one of his albums, 
	according to the Washington Post.

	Visitors can record an album of their own for a fee of $15. Guests can record three minutes and ten seconds of anything on a 7 inch vinyl record. Those who are musically inclined can bring instruments into Songbyrd’s 1947 Voice-O-Graph, as long as the instrument fits into the room. If a visitor lacks an instrument, the cafe will provide the aspiring recording artist with a guitar.

	Before guests record their masterpieces, they should take a look at the restaurant’s menu. Every food item on Songbyrd’s menu is named after a band or song, like “Love Me Do,” a beef on a baguette sandwich, and “Little Richard,” a veggie muffaletta. The cook serves the decent portioned options in a colorful way that can only be described as “hip.”

	While the sandwiches at Songbyrd will satisfy most customers, the open-faced focaccia pizza are the cafe’s most notable dish. If you can’t decide what to order, try the Mumbo Slice pizza, which is topped with pork, pineapple and other goodies. Or, if you’re in the mood for something big and heavy, try the Jumbo Slice pizza, a pizza topped with provolone and pepperoni. Songbyrd also offers delectable coffee and espresso. The restaurant’s organic free-trade coffee and espresso live up to high expectations of even the snobbiest of coffee experts.

	While waiting to be served, guests can browse Songbyrd’s assortment of records for sale and test them out at listening stations before making a purchase. Jazz and Brazilian vinyl records line the shelves of the cafe, accompanied by plenty of blues, indie, classic rock, soul and funk records.


Songbyrd has a plethora of vinyl record items for purchase (Danielle Bourn/The Eagle).




	Songbyrd Record Cafe might be the perfect hipster date spot of Adams Morgan, much like Kramerbooks of Dupont Circle and Chinatown Coffee in Gallery Place. The cafe blends the love for the old with the inevitability of the new, giving the cafe an aura of nostalgic modernism. So, take a trip to Songbyrd Record Cafe, eat some pizza and give all those indie bands some competition with an album of your own.

2016-10-13,AU,China,"I believe it is appropriate, and even ironic due to the fact we attend American University, to discuss America. Gallup polls have questioned the average United States citizen asking, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud?” Based off of this polling, the percentage of Americans to answer ‘extremely proud’ has dropped from 70 percent in 2003 to 52 percent this year. Not only is this an 18 percent drop, but this is the lowest number that has ever been polled.
Much of the negativity that has recently permeated the country is due to renewed conversations on the effects of extensive military involvement abroad, the decline in rank of our education and healthcare systems, and our mass incarceration rates that are the highest in the world. Although there is an abundant amount of other statistics that could further confirm the state of ‘mayhem’ that the United States currently resides in, I will attempt to reverse some of this negativity by demonstrating the many ways the United States still remains number one.
Despite recent economic recession and stagnant growth, we still have the world’s largest GDP. According to the World Bank, our GDP last year was 17.95 trillion dollars. Second place was China at 10.87 trillion. Our GDP is higher than third place Japan, fourth place Germany, fifth place United Kingdom, sixth place France, seventh place India and eighth place Italy combined. Somehow, someway, the United States remains the economic powerhouse of the world. Along with the GDP, the United States household spending is the highest in the world. We consume over 25 percent of the world’s household consumption. One out of every four goods that are consumed go to someone in the United States. This makes us the number one consumer market in the world – and by far.
We also help feed the world. When it comes to overall food production, we lag behind China and India. Our country does lead in corn production and other specific foods, but when it comes to overall food production we rank third. Under the topic of food exports, the United States takes the lead. We export $118.3 billion worth of food every year, more than any other country. That being said, even though America is notorious for having high rates of obesity, every two years at the Olympics we show just how fit we are. We have the most gold medals (1,022), the most silver medals (794), the most bronze medals (704) and the most medals total (2,520). Our gold medal count is higher than the total medal count of every other country, not including the former Soviet Union.
The military remains the most well-funded military to ever inhabit the earth. The military spending dwindled from $700 billion to the $600 billion that it averages around now. This extreme expense allows for technological advancement and progress to outperform any of our expectations. We were the first country to create a nuclear weapon and continue to innovate when it comes to our military might. On top of this, our defense spending outdoes the next 20 countries on the list combined. Furthermore, when we think about the United States and its work abroad, we must remember that we are the country that contributes to more foreign aid than any other nation. 34 billion dollars in foreign aid is distributed to over 100 different nations. The nation we currently give the most federal aid to is Israel. Just about half of the nations worldwide receive the benefit of U.S. foreign aid.
Just taking a look around the American University campus, this next piece should not be a surprise. Students from foreign countries flock to colleges and universities in the United States because of the quality of education this country provides. The United States holds 181 of the top 750 best universities in the world, compared to second place China which consists of 57 of the top 750 top universities. Even when it comes to music, films, literature or any other part of American culture, we tend to have the most global influence in the world. Any country you visit will most likely play music and watch movies that originate from the United States.
So, if I were to ever be polled with the question of, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud,” I would firmly answer extremely proud. We may have our setbacks and flaws, but looking at how far we have come and where we stand in the world today, the United States is the greatest country in the world.

2017-04-11,AU,China,"Murray Bessette, Adela Lan, Larry Liu, Burton Wides and Ning Xianhua take their seats as they discuss the recent events in China. 
Scholars and activists gathered at AU on March 29 to discuss political persecution, organ harvesting and human rights in China. 
Murray Bessette, director of academic programs at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, hosted the panel of speakers that included Adela Lan of Initiatives for China, Larry Liu of Falun Dafa Information Center, Burton Wides of Human Rights Legal Counsel and Ning Xianhua, a former political prisoner in China. 
Jason Lin, a sophomore in the School of International Studies, created the event to shed light on China’s political persecution, censorship and organ harvesting. 
“In light of China’s ongoing violations of human rights, I felt compelled to speak out against the regime and bring together scholars and activists to reveal a narrative to the AU community, often censored abroad or self-censored as a result of pressure from Chinese soft power,” Lin said. 
China’s organ harvesting trade involves forced organ harvesting or political prisoners and minorities to be sold on the black market. 
“In September 2013, the Organ Transplant Institution for Peking University told China Economic Weekly that the hospital conducted 12,000 liver and kidney transplants within the particular year,” Liu said. “All of the organs were from prisoners sentenced to death.” 
Liu said that the Chinese government claims that only 10,000 organ transplants occur per year. In 2007, only 169 hospitals were licensed to conduct organ transplants. More than 600 hospitals had conducted them without a license, he said.
There are two components of organ transplants in China that are very different from the process in the rest of the world and signal abnormalities in China, Liu said. 
Liu said that the first component is that transplants require a very short waiting time of weeks or even days, which he said could only be possible with a large bank where organs can be harvested from. The second aspect is that there was not an organ donation program in the country until 2013. 
Ning Xianhua, a former political prisoner, is very familiar with what prison life is like in China. “I have been detained many times and arrested five times,” Xianhua said. 
In 2013, due to his involvement with creating human rights groups, Xianhua was arrested and placed in jail. Xianhua said the conditions there were dismal; he received soup that was almost water as food, would have to sleep on boards, received very little daylight and was denied visits while in prison due to his political activity. 
“The treatment there was very inhumane,” Xianhua said. “I had a black bag over my head during all of the investigations and only allowed to wear underwear or whatever they gave us.”
Wides, a representative from Human Rights Legal Counsel, described the situation in China as a brutal dictatorship, oppressive and a nightmare for ethnic minorities. 
“No independent minded person can go to bed in China feeling comfortable,” Wides said. 
He expressed that Americans that are not familiar with the issue have no idea of how extreme the situation is. One of the reasons for this is how much power the Chinese government has on what people hear, see and read about China. Wides described the government as having great control over what information is released. 
“As a society of people who can speak freely and live without fear of political persecution, it is our responsibility to ensure that others have the same because just like them, we had generations of activists and revolutionaries that have worked to secure the liberties that we presently have,” Lin said. “It is time for us to pay it forward.”
Fatima Tariq, a freshman in the School of International Studies, was glad to see the discussion panel taking place at AU. She believes that such panels give insight to what is happening in the world and make her grateful for her surroundings, as well as her rights. 
“Humans work to improve their lives, but for people in developing countries such as China, it’s contradictory,” Tariq said. “Working improves their economic lives, but impacts their rights as humans.”
The discussion panel was followed by a screening of the movie “The Bleeding Edge,” which provides insight about organ harvesting. 
For those who would like to help, Lin suggested becoming up to date on human rights violations in China, and reaching out to nonprofits such as China Aid and Initiatives for China to get involved. 
“We can reach out to our elected officials to take a stand against these atrocities abroad and work towards advancing human rights in China,” Lin said.

2019-06-05,AU,China,"Freshmen Saumya Mangalick and Marissa Proto are making waves in the AU community through their start-up beauty company, Viale. They became involved in the American University Center for Innovation after being accepted into the University’s Incubator program. 
Viale connects beauty creators and helps them market their services to students and potential clients. Their website provides links to each creator’s individual booking system. They use social media to reach their clients through direct messaging and show before-and-after pictures of customers. 
Viale didn’t just start as a pitch to the Incubator program. Mangalick said she began providing beauty services to students by starting an eyebrow threading business out of the freshman dorms. 
“I learned how to do threading when I was 12 years old,” she said. “When I got to college, people started asking me where I was getting my brows done.” Mangalick then began threading her friends’ eyebrows, and word quickly spread. 
“It is a pretty big time commitment, so I started charging $5 per threading, and I was running it off of Instagram,” she said. “It became so overwhelming that I was unable to keep track of every single person that wanted an appointment.” 
She researched online booking systems and then began hearing from customers from all grade levels, including graduate students. According to Mangalick, social networking was the key to her services becoming well-known in the student community. 
Customers weren’t the only ones reaching out— Mangalick said that students talented in other aspects of cosmetology started reaching out to her to ask for advice. That’s when Mangalick met Proto, the co-founder of Viale. 
“We started talking and realized that this is a bigger issue that affects every single college campus,” Mangalick said. “Beauty services for students are often geographically inaccessible because you have to go off campus somewhere and [are] also exorbitantly expensive.”
The Viale team is composed of co-founders Mangalick and Proto, as well as Sam Doran who is the company’s tech assistant responsible for maintaining the website. The other beauty creators are Aena Iqbal, who specializes in makeup, Sydney Peltz, a hair stylist, and Alice Wang, a nail artist who was professionally trained in China. 
The team emphasized the impact that social media has had on marketing their product.
“Instagram and social media has really allowed us to connect to people and create these surprisingly intimate personal connections to people,” Doran said. “Our goal is to build community— connecting people— to make the campus a nicer place.”
They chose a name that reflects their values, Mangalick said. Proto, who is of Italian descent, chose the Italian word “viale” because it means avenue. 
“We seek to be the avenue that connects students to other students who are all passionate about self-care, self-love and promoting that in a positive way,” Mangalick said. “Our whole philosophy is that every single person should have the tools they need to take care of themselves and appreciate the beauty that they have.”
Armed with a team of beauty creators ready to service the AU community, Mangalick began looking for the next steps forward.
One of Mangalick’s Kogod professors encouraged her to look into the Incubator program. 
“After doing some research about the program, talking to some of the professors that were involved with it, I met with Marissa and together we did the initial application,” she said. “We had to come in for an informal interview, which is when we brought Sam along.” 
After the interview, the three students pitched Viale to the leaders of the Incubator and moved onto the final stage— a 10-minute formal business pitch followed by a questioning period. 
Viale officially became part of the AU Center for Innovation in January. Through the Incubator, located in Don Meyers, the team is able to hold meetings and workshops in the coworking space, office, and pitch room.
“Professor White and Professor Bellows have worked with us to refine our ideas and introduce us to people in the industry,” Doran said. “[They] give us guidance and also the physical space and validity that goes along with that to build our product.” 
Viale will also receive a grant of $1,500 this summer to cover start-up costs. Over the summer, the two co-founders will focus on researching legalities, competition, and the in’s and out’s of the industry, Mangalick said. 
Their current system needs to be smoothed out, she said, but they will work to improve it for the fall. 
“Our goal for the fall semester is to have a fully integrated platform that has our own booking system, our own payment service, our own gallery showcase and review system,” she said. “We would also be having a mobile app developed so that any student can easily make an appointment for whatever they need.”
Threading client and School of Communications student Jéla Lewter is a two-time customer of Mangalick’s threading service and had a few issues with the booking system and Mangalick’s availability. “I acknowledge that she’s a college student too, and you have to cut them some slack,” she said. “There will be some kinks you have to work out, but overall I was really satisfied with the results and the way my eyebrows turned out.” 
She commented that the service was very conversational and that Mangalick provided the option for the threading to be done wherever she felt comfortable.
Even with the current system that they have, Viale has made an impact on the AU community. 
“Students are excited to feel good about themselves, and we are helping them do that by offering nearby, inexpensive, high-quality beauty services done by people in their community,” Proto wrote in an email. “People want to work with us for free because they see how spreading self-love makes people feel, and they want to be a part of that force.”
When they return in the fall, the Viale team will tentatively appear at a launch event during Welcome Week. “We [want to] show the returning campus and any new students that we’re here to make their lives easier,” Mangalick said.

2019-07-03,AU,China,"Florence Pugh, Vilhelm Blomgren and Jack Reynor in ""Midsommar""
In “Hereditary,” director Ari Aster built tension and horror around deftly placed hints throughout the movie’s 127 minute run time. One could never quite place it, but something was incredibly unsettling about the life of the seemingly normal family at the heart of the story. It isn’t until the third act of the film—following an exceptionally gruesome twist—that things begin to reveal themselves, and all hell breaks loose.
In his much-anticipated subsequent feature, “Midsommar,” Aster disposes of the conventional, dread-inducing uncertainty of a quiet room’s dark corners and drags audience members out into the uncertain terror of the Swedish sun, where blonde men and women adorned in white clothes and flower crowns dance giddily in beautiful, grassy fields.
The plot follows Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor), as well as a group of Christian’s friends. One friend, Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren),invites the group to his remote commune in the forests of Sweden for a once-in-a-lifetime midsummer festival. Dani’s impromptu presence on the trip is blatantly unwelcome from the perspective of the group of friends, especially since it is made clear from the beginning that the couple’s relationship has been teetering on the brink of collapse for some time. That being said, a recent tragedy in Dani’s life caused the group to soften, reluctantly enduring her presence.
This is not to say that Dani is bothersome, however. She is the principal character, and she is deeply sympathetic, especially after what she goes through in the first 10 minutes of the film. Aster establishes immediately that her company is a group of men that aren’t meant to be liked. This plays a role throughout the film as the themes and tropes of toxic relationships and “ugly Americans” progressively become more apparent.
It would be unfair to constantly compare “Midsommar” to its predecessor, but in many ways, it feels like “Midsommar” is a direct and deliberate circumvention of what made “Hereditary” a success. This is one of those pesky movies where writing about the details would be revealing too much, but while  “Hereditary” relies on twists and plot elements that seemingly came out of nowhere to reveal its true intent, “Midsommar” lays bare its machinations relatively early on. The viewers know that something is going to go wrong, and throughout much of the film, our American visitors seem to be uneasy as well.
In disposing of dirty tricks and common—even if intelligently used—tropes, viewers are just as much along for the ride as Dani and company. While the straightforward and even prophetic storytelling is refreshing, at times the borderline telegraphed plot points take away from some of the tension that is being built up into the finale. 
“Midsommar” is essentially a film without a climax, but that shouldn’t necessarily be seen as a negative. There is one moment about halfway through the movie that dramatically and viscerally changes the tone of the festival—oh, you’ll know it when you see it—and from that point forward, the rest of the film feels like a sickening (and beguiling) fever dream that our ugly American friends (and the audience) must ride out.
Whereas “Hereditary” was deceptively interested in the supernatural, “Midsommar” demonstrates that there is nothing more immediately frightening than the mundane. The ambiguity and creeping unease of the festival and the intentions of this idyllic community are infinitely more universal and more frightening than any ghost or demon.
Ultimately, “Midsommar” is a deceptively complex (and funny!) rumination on many themes, ranging from toxic relationships to cultural ignorance, a twisted expression of female empowerment to the reception and craft of Aster’s previous feature. This gruesome misadventure will leave you—along with the residents of this commune—smiling all the while.
Midsommar will be released on Wednesday, July 3.

2020-02-13,AU,China,"Ferkat Jawdat, an Uighur American activist whose family was targeted for his continued advocacy against the prosecution of Turkic Muslims in China, spoke at AU on Jan. 28. Jawdat had not seen his mother in 14 years and said she spent time in one of China’s internment camps for Muslims in Xinjiang.
Jawdat began speaking out about the issue in 2018. Since then, he has been covered in the press, spoken at many events and met with U.S. government officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
The Kennedy Political Union-sponsored event, moderated by Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin, occurred on international Holocaust Remembrance Day. Before the discussion, Rogin took a moment to acknowledge the many human rights atrocities that have taken place since the Holocaust, including what is currently taking place in China. 
Jawdat’s family has faced repercussions as a result of him speaking out. His mother described being monitored, mistreated and pressured by the Chinese government. This story was documented by the New York Times podcast “The Daily.” Jawdat said that even when speaking at colleges like AU, the Chinese government will pressure his mother to tell him to stop speaking out. 
He said that despite the personal risk to his family, his activism is essential. 
“Every time Western people hear about or read about 3 million people locked up in concentration camps, it just becomes a statistic to them,” Jawdat said. “I realized that I can use my story to put a face on the number.”
Jawdat also pointed to the parallels of the rise of xenophobia in the U.S. and in China. 
“China just borrowed the war against terror from the U.S. government and used it as a reason to suppress the Uighurs,” he said.
Jawdat said that college students can involve themselves in the issue by reaching out to their representatives and protesting goods made in China. 
KPU Director Kevin Norton said that he wanted to give the Chinese government a chance to also share their perspective. He wrote to the Chinese ambassador prior to the event, inviting them to join the discussion, but did not receive a response. 
“I told my team that if you want to travel to China, I suggest not working this event,” said Norton.

2020-03-10,AU,China,"This article has been updated with a correction. The University did not quarantine students returning from South Korea for 14 days in Nebraska Hall. The statement was referring to students from China only. No students returning from South Korea returned to campus upon their arrival in the U.S.
As the threat from the coronavirus increases both around the world and in D.C., the University’s cross functional Emergency Response Team says they are exploring proactive ways to handle the situation. Options on the table include online education, a period of suspended in-person classes and self-quarantine or “social distancing,” among smaller adjustments. 
David Reitman, the medical director of the Student Health Center, explained that the University is working closely with the Center for Disease Control and the Department of Health as it designs its response. As changes are made, Fanta Aw, the vice president of campus life and inclusive excellence, and Jessica Waters, the dean of undergraduate education, said that main priorities for the response team are maintaining student health, avoiding any education disruption and continuing clear communication with the community about the University’s status. 
Once decisions are made by the team, Waters said that implementation is done at the individual level.
“We had a group of 20 students coming back from South Korea,” Waters said. “They're all in different academic programs, have different academic needs, maybe one’s a senior, one’s a freshman, they're taking this course or taking that course … We are working very closely with each and every individual student through their associate dean and their advisor to make sure we understand their individual academic situation.”
Reitman said that 10 students returning from China were initially not told by the government to self-quarantine, but following a press conference from Alex Azar, the secretary of Health and Human Services, three students were moved to Nebraska Hall for two days to reduce interactions with the rest of the campus community. Communication between the CDC and HHS confused the process for two days, he added, but the University worked out the problem with the CDC and the D.C. Department of Heath to clarify the situation and notify the students that they no longer had to self-quarantine.
Depending on their situation, students back from abroad will be conducting independent studies, taking online classes or doing some combination of the two, Aw said. 
The Emergency Response Team, which makes the major decisions on the University’s handling of the coronavirus, is made up of six administrators, including Aw, Reitman, Waters, Director of Public Affairs Stacie Burgess, Vice President and Chief Communications Officer Matt Bennett and Assistant Vice President of Risk, Safety and Transportation Dan Nichols.
AU has already taken a series of actions to address the spread of the virus. Study abroad students in China, South Korea and Italy have been recalled to the U.S.after the CDC upgraded the threat level in those countries, and AU announced Thursday night that it was suspending international alternative break programs and the trip to California.
Tess Herdman, a senior in the School of International Service who was studying in Rome until her program was cancelled, said that she’d been told she could continue her classes online, as the Eagle previously reported. She added that the University said she’d be compensated for her flight back, which Aw confirmed. 
All decisions by the team are made with student finance in mind, Aw said, which is why the University is offering refunds and reimbursements where possible.
On Thursday, the Department of Education released guidelines on how universities should handle coronavirus, which included greatly increased discretionary freedom for institutions to change policies on distance education, enrollment requirements, federal work study payments and the length of the academic year. 
“The Department of Education came up with guidance that… really [advances] what needs to happen at this time,” Aw said. “Our team in financial aid… analyzed that to understand what the implications are, and the big macro level is really that they provided enough flexibility that would allow [the University to quickly implement online classes] that would allow it to become part time if needed… so students are not adversely impacted.” 
“Every decision that we've been making when students have been coming back is with financial aid in mind, and making sure that that is really preserved as much as possible because we know that it is really critical for students and their families,” Aw said. 
The University is preparing for the possibility of a coronavirus outbreak in Washington D.C., following the announcement that there have been three confirmed cases in Montgomery County, Maryland and one confirmed case in D.C. These plans involve asking faculty to prepare online course content in the possibility that in-person classes may be suspended after spring break.
Georgetown University announced on Wednesday that it had suspended all university-sponsored international travel. The Hatchet, George Washington University’s student newspaper, wrote on Thursday that the university had done the same.

2020-03-12,AU,China,"The AU Abroad office in 2017. 
In an email late Wednesday night, the University announced that in the wake of President Donald Trump’s decision to suspend all travel between Europe and the United States for the next 30 days starting Friday, all AU Abroad programs worldwide are cancelled effective immediately. 
Students abroad are required to return to their homes as soon as possible, Provost Dan Meyers and Vice President of Campus Life and Inclusive Excellence Fanta Aw wrote in the email to the AU community. All faculty and staff traveling and planning to travel are also required to cancel plans and return. 
The announcement comes days after the University announced it was moving classes online for three weeks following spring break. Students studying abroad in China, South Korea, Italy, and Spain have already been recalled. 
“AU Abroad and academic programs will be providing additional information, but given the impact of this development, we wanted to inform our community as soon as possible,” Meyers and Aw wrote in the email. 
The email said the University would work with students on “academic arrangements, travel and financial matters.”
In a separate email to students studying abroad in Europe, Mark Hayes, the director of AU Abroad, recommended that they book flights back to their permanent addresses as quickly as possible. The decision extends to students in the United Kingdom, even though the country is excluded from Trump’s announcement. 
“Further communications will be forthcoming to you very soon,” Hayes wrote in the email that arrived just before 2 a.m. in the U.K. “Please keep a close watch for new messages and be prepared to respond immediately.” 
This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.

2020-08-12,AU,China,"The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting visual art.
 Editor’s note: This article originally appeared on theeaglecoronavirusproject.com, a separate website created by Eagle staff at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020. Articles from that website have been migrated to The Eagle’s main site and backdated with the dates they were originally published in order to allow readers to access them more easily. 
Updates and corrections: This article has been updated since it was first published with artwork from Mikray Pida. It’s also been corrected to state that Pida lived in Hebei Province during the SARS outbreak, not Hubei and “Katzen Gallery” has been replaced with “AU Museum.” Randal Packer’s name has been fixed with the proper spelling.
Due to the coronavirus, the American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center remains closed, and many artists have had their shows canceled. Curators and creators have been rethinking the ways in which they can present their art. 
Randall Packer, a former professor in the Department of Art, started a website in 2017 called the Third Space Network, an online platform meant to break the barrier between the physical space and digital space. The goal of the platform is to create a “third space,” known as the shared space between the two.
“All of a sudden, with the Third Space Network, I found myself at the center of a complete transformation that was taking place in education, in theatre and performance,” Packer said.  “I’ve been developing techniques for this very moment in time for the past 10 years.” 
Packer develops programs and collaborates with artists to host town halls, live events and  interviews from his home studio. 
Packer felt that the online experience was largely underestimated as a medium for art, due to people’s lack of understanding on how to navigate the internet. During his events, he encourages social interaction among all the attendees, such as asking questions and being active in the chat box.  
“I was really interested in how I could make this dynamic more social so that people forget they are even on the internet,” Packer said. 
Attendance at Packer’s events varies between 100 to 500 people depending on the type, he said. Packer hopes that other artists will be able to find creative and innovative ways to adapt to the changing circumstances. 
Packer has been working on a series called Raw Hope of Humanity Rising to discuss artists’ work and to capture some of people’s ideas leading up to the 2020 presidential election. Topics include Democracy vs Authoritarianism, Information vs Propaganda and Idealism vs Cynicism.
The last talk of the series will be on the theme Real vs Fake on Sept. 2. 
Recently, Packer has also been working with the founding director and curator at the AU Museum, Jack Rasmussen, to host virtual gallery talks and transition some of the gallery’s exhibitions online.
According to Rasmussen, the AU Museum will remain closed for the rest of 2020, and about 20 artists have had their shows canceled as a result. People can still download catalogues from canceled shows on the museum’s website. 
“Works of art are a lot more than a digital image of something,” Rasmussen said. “So it’s been quite a learning experience to make this transition, but it’s also opened up some really interesting possibilities for the future.” 
Mikray Pida, a Uyghur American artist living in D.C., had her show canceled at the AU Museum. The show was scheduled for Sept. 12 through Dec. 13. She comes from a Turkish-speaking ethnic group in Xinjiang Province, an autonomous territory in China whose people and culture are under systematic attack by the Chinese government.   
Pida’s artwork is meant to communicate the powerful experiences she’s had in her life, much of which is based on her time living in China. She lived in the Hebei Province during the SARS outbreak. Her art reflects her experiences with environmental problems, the refugee population, disease, immigration and the connection between these topics. 
“My painting is not about decorative art, or beautiful color; it’s more that I try to make people think about the world we are living in today,” Pida said. 
Because of COVID-19, Pida has not been able to share artwork that she deeply values with the public. She is saddened by this because she believes that showing her paintings in person, and having a dialogue with others, especially Americans, is vital to the impact of her work. 
“After Americans go through the impact of this pandemic, which is huge, from my paintings we can have dialogue about what this is all about, and I want to have that in public,” Pida said. 
Rasmussen is still working on exhibitions for 2023. Now, he’s reflecting on what it means for the AU Museum to move its programming to a virtual environment. 
“In many ways, it’s made viewing a richer kind of experience, using these tools that can’t be denied, and that’s exciting, that’s a great educational resource,” Rasmussen said.

2020-09-12,AU,China,"Editor’s note: This article originally appeared on theeaglecoronavirusproject.com, a separate website created by Eagle staff at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020. Articles from that website have been migrated to The Eagle’s main site and backdated with the dates they were originally published in order to allow readers to access them more easily. 
Six months ago, on March 12, American University students received an email from President Sylvia Burwell that changed their college experiences more than any other event in recent history: AU was going fully online for the remainder of the spring semester, not just for three weeks, as the administration originally announced. 
While the news that AU was transitioning to virtual education didn’t signal the first coronavirus-related change to the semester — just a day earlier, all study abroad programs were canceled — it was the moment that many students realized things weren’t going back to normal anytime soon. 
“Within the last 24 hours, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic,” Burwell wrote at the time. “There are now more than 124,000 cases in 118 countries, and the WHO expects the number of cases and affected countries to grow. Mayor Muriel Bowser declared a state of emergency for the District, and the DC Department of Health recommended that non-essential mass gatherings, including conferences and conventions, be postponed or canceled.”
Earlier that day, the Patriot League canceled all spring practices and competitions, prematurely ending a major sports season. At the time, much of the student body was spread around the world on spring break. In January, students studying abroad in China were called back home. 
Since Burwell’s March 12 email, the AU community has been affected in countless ways. A total of 78 students, faculty, staff and contractors were infected between March 1 and Aug. 31, according to AU spokesperson Stacie Burgess. At least one has died: School of Public Affairs and Washington College of Law professor Joseph Kaplan, who was 66. 
Students have lost housing, jobs, study-abroad opportunities, affordable transportation, sports, in-person commencement and much more. Faculty, staff and the University itself have also suffered. 
Kyla Blazer, a junior in SPA and the School of Communication, said that she doesn’t see the effects of the pandemic going away for a “very long time.”
“There are so many aspects of life it touches, including human life itself,” Blazer said. “You can’t measure the impact of a human life being lost.”
In June, the University announced a hybrid reopening plan for the fall, later retracting it at the end of July, in favor of fully online classes. The change helped AU avoid the risk of outbreaks that have dominated the news at UNC Chapel Hill, Iowa State University and more. According to a New York Times tracker, at least 88,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed at more than 1,600 colleges across the country. 
Still, the cancellation of on-campus housing and in-person classes has made life for new and returning students chaotic, disconnected and isolated, many said. Students frequently take to Facebook meme pages to commiserate about their online classes and feelings of loneliness, spending even more time on Zoom or FaceTime, in an attempt to remain connected with friends that, in some cases, they haven’t seen since before spring break. 



Blazer said that this summer has been the most emotionally difficult part of her life. Not being able to see close friends, especially as a first-generation student without siblings, took a toll, she said. 
“When you’re so busy, but you’re just trapped in your room — or like me, sitting at my dining room table — and just go from meeting to meeting, staring at a screen, it wears on you emotionally,” Blazer said. “The pandemic continued to get worse, classes went online and it all just kind of toppled on top of each other. The disappointment adds up, and you can’t really escape it.”
The summer was also filled with headlines about what many refer to as the other pandemic: racism and police brutality. Protests erupted around the globe after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd in May. Despite the pandemic, AU students gathered at demonstrations to push for change.
Ryan Barto, now a 2020 SPA alumnus, was looking forward to finally being able to bring his mom, who didn’t graduate from high school, to his graduation at the end of the spring semester. While he was disappointed not to have an in-person commencement, Barto feels that there are many other more important things to concentrate on. 
“If anything, AU prepared me for situations like this,” Barto said. “When things go wrong, AU, and the student body specifically, prepared me to be able to just go out and deal with it, to adapt, to be there, to show up, to stand out, and to not let anything bring you down.”
Looking back, what Barto remembers most clearly from spring break, and from the news that the semester was completely changing, is grief. But as things became clearer, he realized he had to just live with it. 
“For a lot of people at AU, AU is their home,” Barto said. “It’s the place that they feel comfortable, where you can see your friend on the quad and get coffee at the Dav, or go to your study spot in SIS. All of that was stripped away.”
Now, students can visit campus after doing an online COVID-19 evaluation, and both The Bridge and The Davenport coffee shops are open for takeout, still staffed by students. 
As for what the next six months will bring? Blazer and Barto aren’t certain, but there are some things they can say for sure. 
“Follow the damn rules and wear your mask,” Barto said.

2020-11-13,AU,China,"Many Friendship Heights Metro Area businesses are closing or have shut down. 
Just one metro stop away from Tenleytown, the Friendship Heights commercial district used to be a hub for American University student life. But recent financial struggles in and around Mazza Gallerie and Chevy Chase Pavilion have prompted pleas for redevelopment. 
“The stores that remain are almost exclusively for the very wealthy or uber rich,” senior Eamon Vahidi said. “It's very inaccessible to a neighborhood that has a lot of students and families; it's not really the right demographic.” 
Friendship Heights, which connects D.C. and Montgomery County, has competed for years with newer developments such as CityCenterDC near Chinatown and DC USA in Columbia Heights. The economic crisis prompted by the coronavirus pandemic only heightened the financial struggles of the area. 
Two of the major retailers that touched down in Friendship Heights during its original development, Lord and Taylor and Neiman Marcus, have announced liquidation sales and foreclosure going into effect this fall. 
Developers in the 1970s predicted that Mazza Gallerie would serve as D.C.’s version of Fifth Avenue, The Washington Post reported. But, a year after opening, the 60-store shopping mall struggled to fill space. The building, which has been sold four times since its opening in 1977, was sold this August in a foreclosure auction for $38 million. 
“This is like a 20-year degradation of the area, and now we’re here wondering what happened,” said Nolan Rodman, who owns Rodman’s, a specialty grocery store and pharmacy located in the area since 1955. “It's insane, there needs to be investment and building and new blood and life. Right now, there's only been people exiting.” 
Rodman attributes some of his store’s success to the fact that it’s family-owned. 
“A lot of retail establishments [in the area] have not adapted over time to a changing environment,” Rodman said. “If I wanted us to change my store completely tomorrow, I would decide with my dad to do it and we would do it. It’s not like we have this bureaucratic thing we need to go through.” 
However, Rodman, similar to others, believes the commercial district still has the potential to prosper.
With household incomes ranging from $170,000 to $200,000 a year, Friendship Heights is home to some of the District’s wealthiest residents. The commercial district sits in the middle of million-dollar, single-family home neighborhoods. 
“[These businesses’] clientele is of a particular market and it doesn't necessarily fit all the people who might be utilizing that area,” said Brett Gilbert, an associate professor in Kogod. “So [land owners] would definitely do well to essentially try to bring in businesses that can tailor to people who are at a lower socioeconomic level.""
Students believe the commercial district’s proximity to campus certainly allows for the space to be utilized by the AU community.  
“I think there’s a chance to really create new living spaces, open up more places for AU kids to go, and increase equity and access,” Vahidi said.

2021-08-03,AU,China,"For those who make their way to D.C.’s Chinatown for the first time, they may find it jarring to see McDonald’s, Chipotle and Walgreens occupying the streets. What’s more, each shop in Chinatown shares a blatantly appropriated chinoiserie aesthetic — which would be fine if the shop was a local Chinese grocer and not a CAVA. 
What went wrong? Where are the Chinese shops — and more importantly — where are the Chinese Americans that kept this neighborhood - and Chinatowns around the nation - alive? 
Director Lisa Mao’s “A Tale of Three Chinatowns” seeks not only to answer those questions, but to also explore the stories of the Chinatowns located in Boston and Chicago. In roughly a century, these Chinese American communities have developed differently in both positive and negative ways. 
The film covers the three Chinatowns through interviews with community members, activists and Asian American history experts. We don’t just learn about the diabolical Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882: Mao hones in on how each Chinatown in focus is unique from each other and why some are in decline. 
Hearing from the residents of these Chinatowns reinforces the sense of community throughout the film; it both warms the heart and allows us to empathize with their personal stories. This makes the issue of affordable housing — or lack thereof — that much more tragic. It's why most Chinatowns today are a result of displacement and are no longer in their original locations. 
Gentrification is another recurring theme and one that particularly hits hardest when Mao focuses on D.C.’s Chinatown. As of now, the Chinese American population in that neighborhood has dwindled to less than 300 people. For a community that first arrived in D.C. to settle in the 1850s, the future of D.C.’s Chinatown seems subject to monopolies and chains, instead of locally-owned businesses — the reason for the neighborhood's entire existence. 
Conversely, the film’s tone does shift from bleak to hopeful when it focuses on Chicago’s Chinatown: unlike D.C., this neighborhood is growing in population and full of business opportunities for Chinese Americans. It’s an intriguing juxtaposition that leaps the film forward with its call to action. 
Exploring Chicago’s Chinatown gives a glimmer of hope because it proves that reviving Chinatowns across the country can be done. The reason is clear: these neighborhoods represent a cultural, communal and economic hub for not just Chinese Americans but for any racial and ethnic minority that has resided there.
While this film depicts extremely relevant issues, how it communicates that message comes off as a bit dated. The film’s graphics, transitions and editing techniques feel a decade or two behind. The choice to fade in important words that interviewees bring up isn’t received as emphasis but instead invokes awkward, cheesy PSA ad vibes. 
That, however, isn’t the largest, most distracting issue. “A Tale of Three Chinatowns” is misguidedly sequenced: the film covers all three Chinatowns, but then circles back to its first subject, Boston, to explore another idea. From then on, topics, interviews and clips struggle to stay cohesive to the main narrative. Scholars and activists end up elaborating on similar, previously explored ideas, or the focus switches abruptly. The film essentially feels finished before the final third of the runtime. 
Nevertheless, this is an extremely important film that shines a light on the histories and experiences of Chinese Americans in these cities. While its shortcomings in sequencing and editing dampen its overall emotional impact, “A Tale of Three Chinatowns” is still a critical documentary to watch today. 
At the very least, it’ll encourage you to support the locally-owned eateries in D.C.’s Chinatown. From dumpling houses to barbecue meats, they are definitely worth a try. You should take a break from that New American brunch place you go to every weekend, anyway. 
“A Tale of Three Chinatowns” screened at the DC Asian Pacific American Film Festival from July 15 to July 25.

2021-12-10,AU,China,"From the Newsstands: This story appeared in our December 2021 print edition. You can find the digital version here.
Students walked onto campus early on the morning of Aug. 30 for the first day of in-person classes at American University since spring 2020. 
For some, the walk across campus was familiar, but for others, it was an entirely new experience. From moving in, studying abroad and performing, students are still adjusting to what life at AU now looks like. 
For Lilliana Silver, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs and the College of Arts and Sciences, the experience of arriving on campus this fall to attend in-person classes was strange. Despite completing her freshman year at AU, she hadn’t been in a classroom since her senior year of high school. 
“March came and [my high school’s administration] was like, ‘We’re going to go online for two weeks’ ... and then we did not go back, and now I’m a sophomore in college,” she said. 
While most members of the class of 2024’s last experience in a classroom was just under two years ago, some non-traditional students like Kai Yuen Suherwan, a sophomore in the School of International Services, haven’t been in a classroom in three years. After graduating high school in 2018 and then enrolling in the Singaporean army for two years, the delay of another year of the college experience wasn’t expected. 
“I would think about the typical American college experience, I would think about the parties, actually going to lecture halls and stuff, and I was looking at the School of International Service and I was like I can’t wait to go here,” Suherwan said. “But then contrast that with me sitting in the basement staring at a screen.”
Now that classes are in-person again, he said he can finally partake in some of the college experiences he’d hoped for. His excitement over being back in person is one that has been echoed by many. 
“For the first time, I was able to look to my left and I had a student there,” said Jehane Djedjro, a sophomore in SIS. “I could talk to them about school and the material we’re learning. Mentally, it’s just brought me to a better place.”
What normalcy looks like has been a question that all students have faced in their return to campus this year. The two remaining classes — the class of 2022 and 2023 — are the only ones that have experienced the University pre-pandemic.
Victoria Guillen, a junior in SIS, said that the return to in-person learning came with a different campus experience than the one she recalled from her freshman year. 
“Returning to campus, socially a lot of stuff changed for me,” Guillen said. “A lot of my friends from freshman year either graduated, took a gap year, transferred or dropped out. So everyone is in a completely different position than where we were before. And that’s been a lot to digest too.”
Borders begin to reopen and students look abroad 
Guillen and many others were planning to study abroad in spring 2022, and while some programs are being offered in a limited capacity, many plans have been put on hold. For many, the opportunity to study abroad is what drew them to AU. According to U.S. News & World Report, AU is a top-ranked university for those wanting to study abroad. At some point during their time at the University, 54 percent of students will study abroad, the University’s website says. One of these programs is the Sakura Scholars program, where SIS students can spend two years abroad at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan.
This year, Mizuki Brent, a sophomore Sakura Scholar, was the only member in their cohort allowed entrance to Japan through their Japanese citizenship to follow the program’s typical progression.
“I haven’t actually met any of my cohorts yet just because my whole freshman year was online, but I’ve been in touch with a couple of them on the phone,” Brent said. “It’s not that I really feel like I’ve been missing out on any friendships because I haven’t been able to meet them yet, but I’ve been able to meet some of the other kids [here in Japan].”
Brent said that AU isn’t the only university where students have felt disconnected during the pandemic. Ritsumeikan University just started allowing students to attend in-person classes due to low COVID-19 numbers. 
“Classrooms are much emptier than normal, classes are mostly all hybrid, and there are a lot of kids in South Korea and China that can’t make it over,” Brent said.
Performing arts returns to the stage
While classrooms across the globe have begun to look more normal as campuses navigate COVID-19 protocols, auditoriums for the performing arts are still just starting to get live audiences back. 
Nicole Klokiw, a senior in CAS, said that the University’s Department of Performing Arts looks very different under post-pandemic restrictions than it did before. Audience capacity is maxed at 50 percent, crew and orchestra members are masked and staging is socially distanced. 
But after performing in two shows last year over Zoom, Klokiw said that even though in-person performances look different than they used to, she’s happy to be back on stage for this fall’s production of “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.”
“This is the first in-person show I’ve been in, in three years,” Klokiw said of the late October show. “Being able to look into the audience … is really nice. It’s pretty encouraging actually to see and hear people reacting. It makes me happy.”
Not all shows have been in person. Kelsey Walker, a junior in CAS said that this fall’s production of Shakespeare’s “A Winter’s Tale” is being filmed. While the decision was made in order to be able to accommodate the possibility of the University closing in-person shows, Walker said that the transition back to campus has still been difficult. 
“I lost a lot of trust in the thing I love to do most, which is really hard to grapple with,” Walker said. “It’s hard to place trust in theater itself, or in an institution like AU when things change so constantly. And I know that you just have to deal with it, but it’s hard when you’re like ‘okay, this isn’t how it used to be, or this isn’t how I want it to be,’ ... Like that’s all I want to be doing, and I don’t really feel like we’re back yet.”
The uncertainty of what the future holds is a sentiment that all students share. With the pandemic still unfolding, students have learned to be flexible and how to deal with the challenges of living in unprecedented times. While what “normal” looks like will continue to change over time, AU students have proven resilient.

2022-04-13,AU,China,"Editor’s Note: Panelist Emily Brignand is a columnist for The Eagle and was not involved in the writing, reporting or editing of this story.
The Asian American Student Union and American University’s chapter of Project Pengyou hosted a joint panel Thursday, featuring speakers who discussed how Asian American history is preserved, taught and used to empower communities. 
The three panelists were Executive Director of the 1882 Foundation Ted Gong; AU Asia, Pacific, and Diaspora Studies professor Elaine Cho; and sophomore Emily Brignand, who is the director of education and culture at AU Project Pengyou. Public history graduate student Mia Owens moderated the event. 
The 1882 Foundation is a non-profit organization that seeks to raise awareness of the history and ongoing impact of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Project Pengyou is a flagship initiative aimed at fostering U.S.-China youth leadership, launching over 80 campus chapters across the country. 
A focal point of the panel was the lack of Asian American history taught in schools, which Cho elaborated on through an anecdote of her own high school experience. 
“[Growing up] I barely had any knowledge of Asian American studies or anything about Asian American history,” said Cho, who was raised in Texas. She said that her first exposure to the subject was in an AP U.S. history class, where a teacher “glossed over” the Japanese internment camps. 
“Any student, no matter what race, what background you are … if someone says ‘that’s it,’ you’re like, ‘I’m going to go and get more information,’” Cho said. “Because of that, I inquired more about it, but the more I inquired about it, I couldn’t find much information in my local library … It fueled me to get more interested in learning about our Asian and Asian American history because that’s part of my identity.” 
Brignand said that for her, learning about Asian American history as a biracial individual has been a journey of self-discovery. 
“As someone who is trying to self discover, I’ve been having trouble really knowing who I am,” said Brignand, who added that her struggle with identity began when she returned to Nevada after living in China for six years. “When I came back, I had a lot of internalized racism because going to middle school and being one of the only Asian people … it felt out of place.”
Now, Brignand feels that more emphasis should be placed on teaching a fuller picture of Asian American history in schools. 
“I think it’s really important for us to use this opportunity and learn more about the world and ourselves, as well,” Brignand said.
The panel comes as advocates across the country are pushing for lawmakers to pass legislation that would require schools to teach about Asian American history. Several states, including Ohio, Florida, California and New York, have begun working towards the inclusive curriculum, according to NBC News. Illinois became the first state to mandate the teaching of Asian American history in public schools last July. 
It is changes like these that Gong said are necessary to protect the stories of Asian Americans from erasure. 
“There is a subset that needs to be looked at, and that is the Asian American component,” he said. “In order to develop those resources and those topics that are not going to be mentioned … that’s where the Asian American studies component comes in.” 
Gong recommended that teachers of students in the K-12 range should “embed Asian American topics within core curriculum.” 
The panel also touched upon cultural appropriation in the media and among celebrities, such as the “fox eye” trend — using makeup to emulate “almond-shaped” eyes that critics say appropriates the Asian facial feature. 
“A lot of times white TikTokers would take trends from different cultures and then use them to their name,” Brignand said. “It’s somehow okay for other people to do it, but when Asian Americans embrace the way they look, it’s somehow judged differently.” 
Cho mentioned that Asian-American appropriation can be traced back to the early Hollywood era.
“It is appropriation because they don’t know the history of it,” Cho said. “Those kinds of stereotypes are long-standing … At the same time people wonder why Asian and Asian Americans are offended because they don’t listen to our stories or experiences.” 
Gong said knowing one’s history and identity are interconnected. 
“The idea is you need to understand yourself, and that requires you to understand all the things that make you up,” he said. “That includes all this history, all this culture, the difference in what that means and that includes the idea of ‘how are you an Asian navigating America?’” 
Looking to the future, the panel stressed the importance of being politically active to pave the road for change. 
“Something that matters a lot to me and a lot of people I know, especially at AU, is the fact that we need to have our voices in important matters that go on in this country,” Brignand said. She also encouraged Asian American audiences to “occupy spaces,” or build a larger presence for themselves in areas where they have been historically underrepresented. 
Cho said that she hopes Asian American students keep advocating for themselves. 
“Tell this University what you want,” she said. “Don’t let it fade… We’re here, we’re here to stay. So continue to speak up.”

2023-05-03,AU,China,"American University’s Center for Environment, Community and Equity concluded its first inaugural year with a round robin of environmental justice initiatives on April 27. The event reflected a year of connections and intersections among faculty, staff and students alike. 
Professors across departments spoke about their research and current projects and celebrated their own personal and scholastic milestones in and outside the classroom. Representatives from the School of International Service, the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public Affairs were just some in attendance. 
As CECE focuses on environmental justice, many professors and scholars shared their backgrounds and the intersectional ways they push for a more sustainable and resilient future. Topics ranged from poor water quality and inadequate infrastructure in cities to the history of environmental injustice in D.C. 
Some attendees discussed integrating environmental justice into research internationally in places such as China and American Samoa. However, scientific research isn’t the only medium to advance environmental justice, and many audience members highlighted artistic projects in progress. 
Maggie Burnette Stogner, the executive director of the School of Communication’s Center of Environmental Filmmaking, mentioned a milestone for one of her films. 
“The film that I just finished, with the help of students…I always love to bring the students in with the experiential education was ‘Upstream, Downriver’ about water equity and justice,” Stogner said to attendees. “We just got two grants to build it from a half hour, what it is today, to a full hour.” 
William Snape, III, the director of the Washington College of Law’s Program on Environmental and Energy Law, announced two new initiatives WCL has implemented.
“We have an environmental justice course that we offer at least every other spring for two credits, that’s a new course taught by an alum, Karim Marshall,” Snape said. “Secondly, our program has been, as many programs do, fundraising from our alums, our adjuncts and supporters. And we did raise some money, and we have awarded six environmental justice public interest scholarships to law students this summer. It’s really exciting.” 
The events focused on sharing accomplishments across various schools to encourage collaboration between schools and highlighted the importance of approaching environmental justice with an interdisciplinary lens. 
In the coming year, CECE will continue to host environmental justice conversations and create a database that will document environmental efforts at AU, such as those from CECE attendees. Dana Fisher, a professor from the University of Maryland, will be taking over the role of CECE director from Simon Nicholson and leading this new charge. Fisher wants the database to become an “environmental think tank.” 
“I’m thrilled to be here. I’m so excited about CECE and helping to build something big,” Fisher said.

2009-02-12,AU,Israel,"Two AU clubs on opposite sides of the political spectrum, Students for Justice in Palestine and AU Students for Israel, tabled on the main quad Tuesday on behalf of one cause: Frisbee.
Chelsea Lund, a senior in the School of International Service, brought together many of AU's clubs to support the union of sports and conflict resolution. Ultimate Peace is an organization that promotes peace in the Middle East through Frisbee games.
""[Ultimate Frisbee] is about the team on both sides, supporting each other,"" she said. ""If there's a foul called, you admit it; it's about honesty and it's about working with your teammates and the other team.""
As a member of AU's Ultimate Frisbee team, Lund invited her teammates to play a match at the event, in addition to the several clubs that tabled nearby. OneVoice, an international grassroots movement for negotiation between Palestine and Israel, and AU's Community Action and Social Justice Coalition were also participants.
Most of the clubs at the event participated in activities together previously, but this was the first chance for several of the on-campus clubs focused on  Israel and Palestine issues to co-sponsor a social event, according to Lund.
Rachel Weingartner, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences and a Students for Justice in Palestine member, said the event sounded like a good opportunity. 
Nick Haras, a first-year graduate student in the SIS International Communication program, participated in Students for Justice in Palestine during his four undergraduate years at AU and continues to do so as a graduate student.
""In Lebanon, for example, soccer matches were used prior to the civil war to try to bring Muslim-Christian reconciliation,"" he said. ""Sports allow people to interact with each other and to compete, to get out a lot of energy in a context that doesn't turn violent.""
All the clubs present addressed some aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Lauren Barr, the president of the OneVoice Movement at AU and a sophomore in SIS and CAS, said the OneVoice Movement had not worked with the Ultimate Frisbee team before.
""It's exciting that we've partnered with them, it's kind of fun to cross boundaries that usually aren't related,"" Barr said.
The biggest mishap of the event was a late start, Lund said, but the clubs were able to stay late so students leaving class had a chance to see everything.
""I was excited to see so many people show up for the tabling, that was the part that I thought would be the hardest,"" she said. ""I also got a great Frisbee game going, which was the whole point of the event.""
Lund is also arranging a D.C.-wide Frisbee game March 22 on the National Mall. Club teams and individuals can sign up and pay $10, which will go towards Ultimate Peace.

2009-12-03,AU,Israel,"Julian-Israel Canizares, a junior in the School of Public Affairs, always dreamt of attending a military academy — that is, until he actually went to one.
Canizares spent his freshman year of college at the United States Coast Guard Academy. In addition to schoolwork, Canizares said first-year students were required to participate in military training, athletics and engagement with upper classmen that included memorizing arbitrary pieces of information to be repeated on demand. Canizares was also involved  in extra curricular activities like the glee club.
By the middle of the year, Canizares found all his endeavors were catching up with him. 
“I was having a lot of difficulty juggling academics and military duties,” Canizares said. “I’m much more of a one-track, focus on one thing and really get-it-done [person] than multi-tasking [oriented].”
As Canizares’ grades and athletic performance continued to suffer, an adviser told him that he was in danger of losing his scholarship and his place at the academy.
“It came down to ‘you’ve got to make a decision as to whether or not you’re going to stay at the academy,’” Canizares said.
That is when Canizares made the decision to transfer to a new school.
In last week’s profile of an upset student who is planning to leave AU, sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences Jack Eichner found the university had not met his needs as a student. 
Eichner and Canizares are part of a large group of students who rethink their college choice. In 2005, 7.1 percent of freshmen at 4-year colleges planned to transfer to another school, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. Like Eichner and Canizares, these students wanted to find an institution that would be a better fit.
Canizares found that fit at AU.
 “[AU] suits my interests actually a lot better than the academy,” Canizares said. “I have a lot more freedom to do what I want to do and ... to just pursue social things that I wasn’t able to do at the academy.”
When Canizares was looking for schools to which he could transfer, a strong political science department was one of his main criteria. He hopes now to go into the State Department or join the intelligence community. He joked that one day he might go on to become the president of the United States.
Actually, President Barack Obama did transfer during his college career. The president started at Occidental College and transferred to Columbia University in search of something “more urban and ... more diverse,” according to US News and World Report.
Steve Pemberton, the co-founder and former co-president of national college admission consulting firm Road to College, said that while transferring universities is not uncommon, there are certain challenges that transfer students face.
“It is not uncommon for students to feel isolated and disconnected from the student body at their new school,” Pemberton said. 
Sean Dixon, a senior in CAS, said this was particularly an area of concern for AU’s transfer students commuting to campus.
“American is a school of cliques if you haven’t been there since freshmen year,” Dixon said. “It’s extraordinarily difficult to penetrate the social strata.”
To help with the adjustment AU has recently restructured its Transfer Transitions Orientation Program, according to Assistant Director of New Student Programs Natalie Gempesaw-Pangan. 
An interactive panel discussion with students who have already experienced the transfer process at AU was also added to the program. Those on the panel continue to reach out to the newer students throughout the year in order to help them establish bonds on campus, according to Gempesaw-Pangan. 
“[The director of New Student Programs, Tiffany Sanchez] and I are huge believers and we do agree that when students feel connected they’re more likely to integrate themselves,” Gempesaw-Pangan said. “So it’s as simple as if you have a buddy to go to that student organization meeting, you’re more likely to go as opposed to if you’re going by yourself.”
This January, Gempesaw-Pangan and Sanchez will hold transfer focus groups to assess needs on campus.
During his first year at AU, Canizares lived on Tenley Campus where he made friends he could “hold on to as being new” to AU like him.
“We ended up ... becoming this really, really close community,” Canizares said.
Although he still misses some aspects of the academy, Canizares said he is happy with his decision to come to AU.
“I actually can’t really imagine going to any other school,” Canizares said. “I’ve made some really great friends, taken some really, really interesting classes, learned a lot of things, done a lot of new things ... I’ve met a lot of really great professors who’ve really helped me to figure out what I want to do eventually.”
Canizares said the school has given him the option to pursue interests in art, music and theater. 
“It’s been a great experience overall,” Canizares said.

2010-03-04,AU,Israel,"This week’s column was difficult to write. Not because of the content, of course - but because of what I had to leave out. I could have written this column about the Women’s Initiative’s new venture, the “Vagina Men” campaign (can I start a “Penis Women” counter-campaign?). But alas, I’ve spilled too much ink whining about feminist follies; this column, instead, will address something of actual consequence.
Twice a week, campus ROTC recruits have to wake up early in the morning to engage in physical training, which will prepare them for their eventual deployment. This task would normally be performed on campus, but our esteemed student government has exiled them to Georgetown. The explanation is thus: AU’s official code prohibits funding to any discriminatory organization. And with the military’s official “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy still in place, alas, what are we to do but ban the presence of the U.S. military?
Leaving aside the fact that the U.S. military has done more to make the world safe for gay people than any do-gooder college activist, let me state emphatically that yes, the military’s policy is asinine. Every civilized country on Earth allows for openly gay soldiers, and it’s a shame that our own military has been slow on the uptake. But it makes little sense to punish our perfectly honorable campus recruits for a policy they have nothing to do with. The only people punished by the student government’s policy are our recruits—most of whom oppose “don’t ask, don’t tell,” anyway.
Really, it is a perfect testament to the fact that the student government is filled with kids playing politician that they think that they’re “sending a message to Washington” this way. Washington’s not listening. Those of you in the Student Government ought to figure out what everyone else on campus knows: you’re not important. Leave our recruits alone and get back to doing what you’re supposed to be doing. Some of you, with your inflated egos, might actually get to be members of Congress one day. Right now, you’re just college kids in a student government. Stop trying to send the Defense Department a statement.
Fascinatingly enough, there actually is something that the SG could do about anti-gay campus culture that falls within their proper purview. If it really wants to cut off funding to campus organizations that promote anti-gay policies, I’ve found one that objectively violates this policy: Students for Justice In Palestine.
This week has been “Israel Apartheid Week” on campuses across the country. Groups such as AU’s own Students for Justice In Palestine have taken part in smear campaigns against the—well, I guess I’m supposed to call it the “Zionist entity” this week—instead standing up for a government that is about as friendly to gays as your humble columnist is to feminists. But I have yet to hear a senator propose cutting off funding to Students for Justice In Palestine, despite the fact that there is only one country in the Middle East where gay men can serve openly: Israel. Try holding a gay pride parade in “Palestine” and see if you can get two feet before your life is endangered. There is simply no comparison between the policies of the two governments toward gays.
I’m not saying that the U.S. military’s policy is fair. I’m just saying that if the student government is going to banish the army from campus, we ought to banish Students for Justice In Palestine, too.
Also Women’s Initiative.

2010-11-12,AU,Israel,"Robert Wexler said the best solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be a two-state solution during a speech Wednesday night in the University Club.
A democratic Jewish-Israeli state and a Palestinian state should both exist with internationally recognized borders, “most likely mirroring the 1967 lines with swaps in a way that almost 80 percent of the ‘settlers,’ can be assigned within the internationally recognized borders of Jerusalem,” Wexler said in the Kennedy Political Union-sponsored event.
The former Democratic representative of the 19th District of Florida and current president of the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace said one of the major obstacles in solving the conflict is overcoming bias.
“Many of us come with bias, I do, I readily admit that,” Wexler said. “From my 13 years in Congress and six years in the Florida State Senate, I have been deeply committed to the unbreakable bond between the U.S. and Israel.”
The Israeli youth that Josh Halpren, a freshman in the School of Public Affairs, met on a visit to the city of Ashkelon were unwilling to change their negative perceptions of Palestinians, Halpren said during the question-and-answer portion of the event.
“There has been a demonization of the other side, in some cases a dehumanization, which is terribly unfortunate,” Wexler responded. “People have developed these ideas because of the experiences they have lived through. We can’t undo those experiences. All we can hope to do is create a political dynamic in which they can see hope.”
Now that the settlement freeze has expired, leaders have returned to discussions over settlements. However, Wexler said settlements were a distraction to the real peace talks that would solve the crisis.
“The moment we have a discussion, the issue of settlements will be cast to the side and will allow [President Barack] Obama, [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and [Palestinian President Mahmoud] Abbas to engage in the real end-of-conflict discussions that need to happen,” he said.
Wexler said a uniting factor between them is that both countries share a common enemy in Iran.
“The national security interests of the state of Israel and the Arab world is essentially identical,” Wexler said. “They share a common thread: extremism in Iran and a nuclear weapons program there, which threatens to ignite a nuclear arms race in the region.”
While the current economic sanctions have done significant damage to Iran, they have not proven whether they are deterring nuclear proliferation, Wexler said. Wexler said Iran felt most vulnerable after witnessing the U.S. defeat the Iraqi army after seven weeks.
“I think we have a very limited time for diplomacy.” Wexler said. “I’m not advocating military action, but you have to put every option on the table because if you don’t, the Iranians will take advantage of it. Remember, the game of chess was invented by the Persians ... they are great manipulators.”

2011-04-12,AU,Israel,"A Student Government resolution recommending AU invest in U.S. companies that are based in or invest in Israel failed after contentious debate April 10.
Even after several revisions, the resolution failed with a vote of 10 senators for, 11 against and seven abstentions. 
Students who supported the resolution said it wasn’t political but rather made financial sense. They felt Israel was a good place to invest because of its strong economic performance during the recession and status as a world creditor, not debtor.
“This is not foreign policy. This is us using our investment money in businesses in Israel,” said College of Arts and Sciences Senator Amy Leazes, the resolution’s sponsor.  
But senators who opposed the resolution felt it was too political.
“It’s wrong for us as the student government body to support such a resolution,” said Class of 2012 Senator Roger Deming. “You can say all you want: ‘This [resolution] to me is just a business transaction.’ But I’m sorry, the Confederate flag is more than a flag.”
Students who are not in the SG voiced their opinions on the resolution during the meeting’s public comment period, before the debate on the legislation.
Former SG President Andy MacCracken, a senior in the School of Public Affairs, said he believes investing in U.S. companies that invest in Israel is a sound financial decision. 
“We [AU] have made poor financial decisions in the past. Looking forward, students need to be engaged in how we’re investing our dollars and looking at trends of where it’s most sensible to invest money,” MacCracken said. “Coming out of the financial recession that the world is just recovering from now, Israel is a nation that was least affected.”
Other students disagreed, saying that the economics and politics could not be separated on this issue and that AU support for Israel would be wrong because of Israel’s actions in Palestine.
“I am not interested in AU making financial or institutional profit. I am, on the other hand, very interested in ensuring that the investments that AU does make are in line with socially just and equal principles,” said School of International Service senior Sepideah Mohsenian. “By investing in innovation from Israel, AU is de facto supporting Israeli foreign policy.”
AU spokeswoman Maralee Csellar said AU’s finance office would need to research all funds to determine if the University invests in any companies that invest in Israel.
In 2006, AU’s Board of Trustees passed a resolution saying AU “will not invest directly in companies doing business in the oil and gas sector in Sudan.” The University also notified its investment managers to end any investments in companies doing business in the oil and gas sector.
This resolution is still in effect.

2011-10-11,AU,Israel,"American University is well known for its inclusion and efforts to unify students from a bevy of diverse backgrounds. From athletics to political speakers to the Westboro Baptist Church Counter Demonstration, the AU community comes together to support our entire community. While we each have our own opinions, our campus renowned for our civility and ability to engage in an open dialogue. 
In this light, the students of American University Students for Israel (AUSFI) do not feel it is appropriate to engage in ATV’s upcoming special program focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The format of this program, asking student leaders their opinions, only creates the potential for a hostile environment. 
AUSFI is the umbrella student organization for Israel life on campus, focusing on educating students on the culture and politics of Israeli society. AUSFI embraces the same values as the AU community; we believe in allowing for an open dialogue in a safe and welcoming environment. Unfortunately, ATV’s proposed program does not provide a welcoming and educational environment in which to engage. We encourage students to remain the well-read and educated leaders for which we are constantly singled out. To outline our position in one simple line: We support direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, without preconditions, with final status compromises that result in peace for both parties living together in harmony.
Nothing productive would come of a debate between two student organizations with differing opinions. It is unfair to pit students against each other, especially about a subject many find so personal. At the end of the day, it is up to the leaders of their respective countries to come to a conclusion. What happens within the upcoming weeks regarding Israel and Palestine will certainly be matters of discussion, but not debate.

2011-12-07,AU,Israel,"From sleeping on sidewalks to organizing vigils in McPherson Square, AU students in Occupy AU and other student groups are giving their continued support for the Occupy D.C. movement. Here are what each group is doing to support the Occupy movement.
Community Action and Social Justice Coalition
CASJ is leading AU student engagement in Occupy D.C. The coalition acts as an organizing collective for 14 campus clubs that coordinates independent events and directs interested students to clubs within the coalition, according to Mitch Ellmauer, a junior in the School of Public Affairs. 
CASJ started in the 1960s as an anti-war and anti-draft counseling center and is not funded by AU. CASJ clubs including Movement for Global Justice, Student Worker Alliance and Fair Trade Student Association have had student representation at Occupy D.C.
During the first two weeks of Occupy D.C., CASJ had 10 to 12 students and alumni actively participating together in the events, some of which stayed overnight in sleeping bags at the protests. 
“The point is to try to get people to see and know what’s going on in the city in terms of activism,” said Mary Donoghue, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences.
Participation has lately been on a more individual basis and has been less consistent.
“The thing about Occupy is that it’s trendy, so people will go once or twice then lose interest,” said Rachel Mandelbaum, a junior in the School of International Service.
CASJ will be focusing on student democracy next semester, which would include increased student input in University decision making that goes beyond student government. The coalition hopes to put an elected student with voting power on the Board of Trustees.
Students for Justice in Palestine
While many members of Student for Justice in Palestine have participated in the Occupy movement independently, the group helped organize a vigil Nov. 6 in McPherson Square for the victims of Operation Cast Lead, the 2008-2009 war in the Gaza Strip.
The vigil was not an official Occupy D.C. event, but many D.C. occupiers joined in, Steve Demarest, a junior in SPA, wrote in an email.
SJP also protested Israel’s use of Caterpillar bulldozers during Operation Cast Lead to destroy homes, factories, food and water systems, Demarest said. 
“There is a diverse group of political views within the Occupy movement, but I think the one common thread that unites protesters is opposition to corporate abuse, i.e., putting profit over people,” Demarest said.  
Eco-Sense
Eco-Sense has been advocating for sustainability and environment awareness in the Occupy D.C movement. Members volunteer and engage in political activism on environmental issues on campus and in D.C. A handful of Eco-Sense members were recently involved with the Occupy D.C. movement.
Mandelbaum; Megan Lyle, a sophomore in CAS; and other AU students attended the Anti-Tar Sands Keystone XL rally Nov 6. The rally was not directly a part of Occupy D.C., but many occupiers attended it, Lyle said. 
The protest focused on stopping the construction of the Tar Sands Keystone XL pipeline, which could potentially pollute major water supplies and transport tar sands oil that burn dirtier than other oils, according to Mandelbaum. 
The pipeline would stretch across thousands of miles from Canada, through the continental United States, to Texas to transport unrefined oil, Lyle said. 
American Vegan Outreach
American Vegan Outreach has not been directly involved with Occupy D.C., but numerous AU vegans have joined the Occupy D.C. movement, according to Paige McNamara, a sophomore in CAS. 
The Occupy D.C. Declaration directly mentions opposition to factory farms, a key AVO issue, McNamara said. 
McNamara held teach-ins about veganism at Occupy D.C., offering the platform for discussion on why veganism should be a viable option for all people.
“I hope to be able to introduce the idea of veganism as a tool of liberation, not just for animals but for workers, people, consumers to the people at McPherson,” she said. 
McNamara also said sustainable living practices are a major theme at the Occupy D.C. camp. McNamara said it is only natural that veganism will be the next major discussion at Occupy D.C.
Justice Not Jails
The prison reform advocacy group took part in a march from the McPherson Square to a Wells Fargo bank Dec. 2 to protest the bank’s investment in the GEO Group. Demarest said the GEO Group is a private prison company that cuts costs by assigning one doctor for every 1,300 prisoners at the Rivers Correctional Institute, where many D.C. residents are held.
He saw “a decent amount” of people at the protest.
“Once we got to Wells Fargo, many people spoke about their own thoughts and experiences with private prisons and the prison system in general,” Demarest said. 
College Democrats
College Democrats is one of the largest clubs at AU and has differing opinions when it comes to the Occupy D.C. movement, said Chris Litchfield, president of College Democrats and a junior in SPA and CAS. 
College Democrats agrees with Occupy D.C.’s major issues, but not with the methods the group has proposed for solutions, he said.
One of the major issues that College Democrats has focused on is wealth inequality. The Democratic Party is looking for a more equitable tax structure to help shrink the wealth divide between the 99 percent and the 1 percent, Litchfield said. 
“I think there is still a role to play when it comes to advocacy in government,” he said.
He also said he sees a lot of overlay between the future of the Democratic Party and Occupy participants.
“Occupy is not an arm of the Democratic Party, but moving forward, this will be a very defining time,” Litchfield said. “It is nice to see other people than the Democratic Party talking about these issues.”
On campus, College Democrats hosted a panel on debt negotiation Nov. 30 after the failure of Congress’ Super Committee and plans to host events in the near future focusing on student education of important issues facing the United States and AU.

2012-12-07,AU,Israel,"A candlelight vigil was held on Dec. 4 by the pro-Israel group, J Street U, in memory of the Palestinian and Israeli victims of the recent conflict in Gaza. The event was held in front of the Kay Spiritual Life center. 
Candles were lit in honor of the victims while Ibraheem Samirah, vice president of AU Jewish Voice for Peace, read the names of victims. The list was eight pages long and included six Israeli names along with 107 Palestinian names, according to Damián Fontanez, a member of AU Students for Justice in Palestine.
The names were intentionally scrambled in order to keep focus on the individuals rather than the ethnicity, according to Bradley Harmon, president of J Street U at AU.  
“We are not here to mourn the loss on one side or another,” he said.
J Street U hosted the event after other chapters of the national organization held similar vigils, according to Harmon.
AU Students for Justice in Palestine, AU Jewish Voice for Peace and Christians United for Israel at AU co-hosted the vigil. 
Prayers from the Jewish, Muslim and Christian faiths were then read in honor of the dead.
“If we can’t come together on this, we can’t come together on anything,” Harmon said.
Students in attendance found inspiration in the prayer service, according to Elana Friedman, a junior in the School of International Service. 
“When I’m at school I don’t pray,” Friedman said, “so it’s nice to remember we can pray for things to get better.”

•i just want you to text me.
•Thirsty girl is on Anderson 6. You guys will have to figure out the rest ;)
•You're such an ass to me. And you're really only nice to me and talk to me when you want some. Why do I still like you so much?
•Yeah, there are guys here who prefer dating to hook ups. We exist I promise. Some of us are actually decent looking by AU standards too. You aren't likely to find a relationship this time of year though--not with finals and winter break about to happen.
•Alcohol = the only thing that will get me through finals.
•I'm a girl liking female accounting major, but you're probably not talking about me :[. Either way, ask her to hang out! There is no girl on campus that would not be flattered if another girl asked her out. Forreals. 
What class do you have with her? Is it intermediate? 
•I'm sick of only having feelings for people who can never know my feelings for them.
••pale nerdy girls with cute faces why do I always date you 
because we're pale, nerdy and cute, of course!
•@LDR help: I'm also miserable in a 3 year LDR and wanting help. I wish I knew you because I am drowning in loneliness and don't know how to make all the pain stop. idk if I can make it until May (when my LDR will finally end and I can be together again with the love of my life). But I know he is worth the wait. I just wish I had more support. All of my friends have local significant others, and they don't understand how hard it is to be apart from your soulmate.
•@$100 eagle bucks that I'm overweight
I can say whatever I want about how much I weight but I can't make you believe me haha. Truth is though that I'm not overweight but I am an advocate for equal representation and for people to not hate on other people because of the way their bodies are.
•i can't get enough of you, baby
@I’m so sick of my friend group here treating me like crap: go to various clubs to meet people. During your first meeting, you might only meet a few people, but if you continue to go to clubs that are relatively active, you will make some new friends :)
•@looking for straight, outgoing guys looking for a real relationship. We exist. Want to meet at the Dav on Wednesday, say around 2:00pm?
•@part of our religious upbringing: yeah, that was my main point. Pre-marital sex is ok, but BC isn't? Still just curious
•Hi, fool here who has booked his life in DC through the 24,
•What am I supposed to do? Say, ""hi will you go out with me in a month?"" I'm planning on asking her out, just when I come back for the spring semester.
•when I said we couldn't be friends I didn't mean it. can we be friends? I miss you.
•1) Saint Paul says absolutely nothing about our modern notion of homosexuality. He talks about prostitutes in the temple/some random person decided to translate a Greek word who's meaning we have no idea of as homosexuality. The acts he condemns are not that of two people of the same gender who love each other
2) Just because Jesus never mentioned it, doesn't mean that people can't draw conclusions from the text
3) So what if Jesus was gay? Is your faith so weak that it would be destroyed by something as trivial as that?
4) It was a joke.
•I'm not someone people notice. I'm so glad he noticed me.
•Awkward library sex. Never, ever again. . .
•Ask me out already!!!!
•my perfectionism is my greatest shortcoming.
•I've friendzoned at least four white girls since Monday. I love me.
•Let me clue you in on something. Olympic weightlifters compete in weight classes. Those in lower classes have to cut weight, but those in the highest class have no incentive to do so, so they eat thousands of calories a day to fuel hours of training per week. There's nothing healthy about it, they sacrifice their health for the sake of their strength and their sport. YOU don't do any of those things, so don't use their commitment as an excuse for your bad habits.
•adderall prices here are absurd! $12 for an XR... wtf?! That's almost as bad as people trying to sell an 8th for $60... #freshmanidiots
•Be nice and do good. Every day is new.
•I don't know why more people are giving a hoot about the so-called ""apartheid"" in Israel when the Syrian government is killing their own people. Smh
•@""Does every black person know each other here at AU? I swear I was sitting in MGC sitting near two girls and piles of other black kids kept coming by and hanging out with them.""...I noticed that too, but is that a big deal?
•Kerwin’s salary has increased by almost $31,000 from fiscal years 2009 to 2011.
This is unacceptable. Good on The Eagle for doing some real reporting!!
•@Ranter who said ""There’s a really cute blonde guy with glasses"": I know who he is! wanna bone?
""I’m one of those annoying hipsters who listens to obscure music"" ahahaha oh i bet you do you idiot
The dance team is all poop
•She packed my bags last night.....preflight.
•yo, can you people start using ShittyLAL? I made this wonderful site for you people, and now it's just sitting there, untouched, gathering dust. I even added a chat feature, but that's irrelevant IF NO ONE IS EVER ON THE SITE. And I think we all take chat features for granted. I certainly did. It took me like two weeks to plan out how I was going to implement it plus several hours of actual coding. It would just be cool to see it in action once in a while.
•Eagles are turning people into horses
•To my friend-- I haven't seen you as much this semester, but I love you very much.
editor, thank you for the rants!!
•@Hooking-up-is-not-the-answer: If he really loved me, he'd be the one reaching out. Wouldn't he..? If he could prove it, maybe then I can get the reassurance I need to fix my train wreck lifestyle
•2nd floor study room Mitt Romney loves you all, and he wants you to know that all he really ever wanted was your approval and friendship. Hugs on request. 
•Someone posted about me on AU Compliments and it almost made me cry. It's been a rough day, that was just what I needed.
•Billy Dooley is by far my favorite basketball player.
•Looking back at Welcome Week makes me see how far I have come in meeting people and making friends- I am surprised but happy to say that it's been a great semester. By the way, what is the first initial of ""Nice Girl?""
•@Chai Mix: I KNOW, RIGHT?!?
Just bored at work and thinking about how much I love you. I am so lucky.
•Dear biddies on the 3rd floor:
Quiet does not mean normal level biddie screeching. Shut the frack up, because some of us are actually trying to study.
•What were people complaining about on the quad today?
•Number 43 on the basketball team kind of looks Amish but I kind of like it.
•I'm trendinggggggg I'm trendinggggggg!

You are all doing SOMETHING right. Haven't been around a more intelligent, revolutionary, powerful, and inspirational group of women before.
•""We girls sniff our underwear at the end of the day before we put it in the hamper. Ya, it's a thing."" uh. that is not a thing. you may do that, and more power to you, but that is not a thing that girls do.
•@wants to try talking first: that actually would make me even more willing (I'm not sure if this is for me though, there were two posts about doing the same thing sex frequency-wise in high school)
•to ""je t'adore"" - did we work together on a project in class? If so I'd totally hook up with you, just text me already.
•YOU ARE ALL WRONG. Okay here's the breakdown: SOC is Hufflepuff, SIS is Gryffindor, KOGOD is Ravenclaw, CAS is Slytherin. And everyone else is a squib.

•I literally feel completely and utterly alone here. My best ""friends"" go off and do things without even a thought about me, and I really have no one else. I honestly have never felt so completely lonely. Don't tell me to join clubs because I'm in plenty. I really am just miserable. And I don't know what to do.

2013-02-11,AU,Israel,"Former AU basketball player Charles Hinkle will be blogging throughout the season while playing for Kis-Raba menti Takarek Soproni Kc in the Hungary-A Division. Hinkle’s new squad is just three games out of first place. Hinkle has played in one game since recently joining the team. Submit questions to sports@theeagleonline.com for Hinkle to answer in future blogs.
Szia from Hungary,
After spending 5 months in Istanbul, my career has taken an unexpected turn as I have changed teams and now play for Soproni which is located in Sopron, Hungary. 
So far, my first year as a professional basketball player has been a roller coaster, but one I do cherish. Few have played basketball internationally. But for the people who have, my season is typical for a first year player.
As explained through talks with coach Jeff Jones after my senior season about going forward professionally, I learned that my career might not always be smooth sailing from the beginning. My first job, like my stint in Turkey, is one to get my feet wet, so to speak. It is an opportunity to get experience on my resume and to show other teams that I can not only handle myself on the court, but off as well.
With the overall experience, I loved Istanbul. I was given a three bedroom apartment which I shared with my American teammate, Kervin Bristol, who graduated from Fordham University. We not only played against each other during my first year of eligibility in the Cable Car Classic Tournament held by Santa Clara University, in which AU won, but we were also paired to play on the same team for a tryout this past summer for a team in Israel, which was held in Florida.
The two foreigners, Bristol and I, immediately showed a presence on the court and showed what we were brought in to do. Within the first couple of games, I was top five in the league in scoring and Bristol was top three in both rebounds and blocked shots, but our performances on the court were falling short of getting wins. Compared to all the other teams in the league, my team was one of the youngest in the league and it was evident.
In the majority of the games, my team was either winning, tied or within a four-point margin in the fourth quarter. Most of those games we lost. The team’s morale quickly dwindled and the general manager of the team decided it was best to go with a new coach in early December. 
Although the new coach began implementing new strategies, those too failed as my team fell to a disappointing 3-14 record. By this time, everyone was frustrated with the results of the games.
Throughout the season I would come in before and stay long after for just about every practice. Often I would envision coach Jones telling me to stop working out during the season and rest my body like he often did during my stay at AU, but the constant losses drove me away from those desires. Still nothing was changing, and my team continued to lose.  
It was around early January when I got a call from my agent that a team in Hungary wanted to sign me. He told me that the team was in a race for the top spot of the conference and that the player I would be replacing suffered an injury, and the team needed to fill the role immediately. He told me that if I performed like I did in Turkey, it would look great on my resume because it is against stiffer competition. Being excited for this great news, I was all but ready to pack my bags. But the team in Turkey had to be willing to release me.
After a couple of talks between the team and my agent, I finally got the release, which brings me here to this very moment. The competitive nature in anyone, let alone an athlete, is extremely high as is evident between the changes in mood when you go from a team that is at the bottom of the league to a team that is competing for a top seed in the playoffs. Everyone is much happier and I feel extremely blessed to be put in this scenario and given another chance to win a championship.
Only being in the country for a couple days, I have not seen much. The best way to describe the city is to compare it to an old British town that you would see in the movies. 
I was a drastic change. Where the team in Turkey would sometimes not practice, now I have two-a-day practices nearly every day. Although the practices run an hour and 45 minutes at most, I am finally able to get my legs under me and am getting used to the change in routine.
The team initially put me up in a hotel until the house where I would stay was available, and the first morning I woke up breakfast was being served. A sweet scent permeated the air and I sped across the hallway to reach the familiar smell. 
BACON!!!! 
For those who do not know, Turkey is a Muslim country, and pork is forbidden. Bacon, sausage, ribs and everything else that my stomach had missed so much is now available in Hungary… 
I guess you can say Hungary is serving my appetite quite well.

2013-07-13,AU,Israel,"By Matthew Farrell
Martin Luther King Jr. famously said from a jail cell in Birmingham, ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" 
In a simple and concise manner, it articulates the notion that all men are equal and should have a universal interest in each other's well-being and that incidences of injustice shouldn't be looked at as isolated incidents, but as actions that are helping to shape what is viewed as acceptable in our society. 
With this in mind, I want to talk about the Palestinian / Israeli conflict. What's interesting about this conflict is that while the United States continues to use violations of United Nations regulations as a pretext to rally international action against other foreign countries such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria, we as a nation continually underplay the fact that Israel is in violation of multiple international laws. 
To give a brief overview for those who aren't familiar with this, Israel's admittance as a U.N. member state was under the condition that it abide by general assembly resolution 194 calling for the right to return and compensation for Palestinians. A condition it still hasn't fulfilled. The U.N., in addition to the International Criminal Court, have repeatedly ruled that Israel's naval blockade, separation wall and settlement programs are in violation of international law. 
Israel has also been determined by the U.N. to be an occupying force in Gaza which make its treatment of Palestinians there, including it's extra-judicial killings of military and political figures, illegal. Recently, the U.N. released a report detailing how Israel Defense Forces coerce abused children to open bags suspected of containing explosives at gunpoint and even use them as human shields.
You might be wondering why I'm listing Israel's international crimes without addressing those of the Palestinians. My point is not to demonize Israel. My intention is to highlight the point that people are aware that Hamas has violated international law, but not many are aware of the scope and gravity of Israel's crimes. As a democratically elected political party, Hamas has routinely labeled terrorists, their government is de-legitimized and they also face sanctions and blacklisting. Yet many people are unaware that Israel routinely violates international law and Israel only faces minimal international pressure for it's violations of international law. 
It can't be denied that this is a complex situation whose resolution will extend far beyond the admittance of wrongdoings on both sides. However, it simply cannot stand that we continue to ignore the rulings of our international governing bodies when it comes to states that our government favors. At the very least, our country needs to acknowledge that Israel has a lot to account for in this conflict. Contemporarily we are setting a dangerous precedent. We are showing that it is okay to violate international law as long as you are, or have the backing of, a superpower. ?

2013-11-12,AU,Israel,"General site 1 of Geva’s paintings in Katzen Museum.
Israeli artist Tsibi Geva discussed his artworks hanging in the Katzen Arts Center with art critic Barry Schwabsky of The Nation and museum curator Jack Rasmussen in front of an eager audience Nov. 9. 
Geva kicked off his talk by explaining the importance of the process. He accomplishes this by creating multiple strokes of black and white with a layering effect to create a narrative or event for the viewer , which makes pieces come to life.. These black and white streaks and the subtle vibrancy of intense colors represent the influence of conflict and dialogue in his experiences and in Israeli life, Geva said.
When asked about the difficulty of being perceived as an artist in an age that is heavily video-and-media oriented, Geva replied rather optimistically. 
“The new abstract is hard to understand…but give it time and that will change,” he said. 
Geva is an internationally recognized artist with exhibitions in Tel Aviv, Berlin, Italy and New York. His awards include the Aptowitzer Prize, which promotes Israeli advancement in the arts, and the Mendel and Eva Pundik Prize for Israeli Art. 
Arguably his most powerful response was when someone in the audience asked him to pick a painting and explain what it meant to him. Geva seemed discomforted by the question, but was forced to give an answer that left the audience silent and with goose bumps. 
“The story writes me, it’s not me that writes the story,” he said.
He further explained that most artists are able to talk about their problems because painting those particular experiences has helped them do so. However, Geva’s process is the complete opposite. He admits that he paints before he can talk about his struggles, and even after, he doesn’t know how to talk about it. 
Geva stressed the importance of a viewer to be able to perceive a certain energy from paintings without knowing anything about the painting or the artist himself. 
“For me, the painting on the wall has to talk,” he said. 
Tsibi Geva’s work is currently on display at the Katzen Arts center from Nov. 5 to Dec. 15 along with five other exhibits ranging from sculpture to photography.

2014-02-12,AU,Israel,"February officially begins in terms of big box office releases with three new contenders and a smattering of independent releases. A couple of cold-blooded vampire school kids go head-to-head with grisled WWII art historians and blockbusting LEGO men. See what the critics had to say about this weeks offerings at the cinema.
1. The Monuments Men
George Clooney (“The Ides of March”) and his band of brothers including Bill Murray (“The Grand Budapest Hotel”) and John Goodman (“Inside Llewyn Davis”) seem to have hit up upon monumental wall of critical fury over the films profligate historical omissions, causing The Guardian to write a missive against the exclusion of Ronald Balfour. Some have even taken to flaying the score by Alexandre Desplat (“Zero Dark Thirty”) with Flavorwire’s Jason Bailey writing “when that information was revealed at the end of the film (it’s one of those movies that saves all the credits, except the title, for the end), this viewer was stunned. After two hours of wondering what hack was responsible for this obtrusive, garbage music, I certainly wasn’t expecting to see this six-time Oscar nominee’s name…” 
2. Vampire Academy
Mark Waters’ “Vampire Academy” was apparently so good that it opened cold, leaving scant critical consensus to be found. Even though the film was written Daniel Waters, whose “Heathers” outranks “Mean Girls” in notable and quotable snipes and insults, Film Racket’s Bill Gibron had some gripes with the film writing, “Hoping to catch a ride on that particular cash cow, The Weinstein Company is giving us an adaptation of Ms. Mead’s young adult “phenomenon, Vampire Academy,” he writes. “With a mythology so mangled that even J.R.R. Tolkein’s Silmarillion laughs at its ludicrousness, a stink bomb like this requires the devotion of a true fan to not only figure out what’s going on, but why we should give a bat’s ass in the first place.”
3. The LEGO Movie
Big things have small beginnings and the LEGO people in “The LEGO Movie” took over the box office this weekend. It helped that the film has garnered a strikingly large amount of good will and critical praise. Salon.com’s Andrew O’Hehir said, “What could easily have been test-marketed, corporate-processed crap, a branding extravaganza pretending to be a movie, instead becomes a surprisingly enjoyable and satisfyingly dense family entertainment that pays tribute to the spirit of free play and individuality.”
4. Big Bad Wolves
An Israeli thriller about a rogue serial killer committing a series of grisly murders conjures up little sympathy with The New York Times’ Manohla Dargis. She wrote, “In one of those ill-advised director statements included with the press material, Mr. Keshales and Mr. Papushado invoke the ‘existential anxiety’ that ‘serves as Israel’s foundation’ and promise that their movie will ask, ‘Does being the victim give you the legitimate right’ to become a vigilante? Nice try, guys. Although they toss in a sympathetic Arab character, his pacific presence is soon eclipsed by a tortured man’s agony. Is that the point? Is there a point? “
5. The Attorney
A new South Korean drama opens locally chronicling life at law school. The Washington Post’s Mark Jenkins wrote “‘The Attorney’ can be melodramatic, and first-time feature director Yang Woo-seok is not yet a singular filmmaker. But the movie is carried by its rousing pro- democracy message and a lively performance from the versatile leading man, whose credits include such notable Korean films as ‘The Host’ and ‘Memories of Murder.’”
6. The Broken Circle Breakdown
Belgium’s entry for the 2014 Oscars is an ode to bluegrass and all things American. RogerEbert.Com’s Joyce Kulhawik thought the film was fairly profound writing “It’s a wild scene of pain and desperation, and leads to the film’s equally shocking and final blessed moments, which take us back to the film’s beginning: Didier’s band of musicians hovering—sometimes in the background, sometimes nearby—like a cowboy chorus, singing the songs of life, as celebration, as benediction, as commentary, as pure emotional release, singing in the void for all they are worth, singing that somehow we will all get through it —unbroken.”
“The Lego Movie,” “The Monuments Men,” and “Vampire Academy” are in wide release. “The Broken Circle Breakdown” opens at the Avalon. “The Attorney” opens at the Cinemark Egyptian.

2015-08-05,AU,Israel,"President Barack Obama challenged critics of the recent nuclear accord with Iran in a speech at the School of International Service Wednesday, posing a black-and-white scenario: accept the deal or risk further war in the Middle East.
The deal implements limits on the Iranian Nuclear program over the next 15 years by reducing the country’s stockpiles of enriched uranium and closing two thirds of its centrifuges, both of which are necessary to build a nuclear bomb. It has been heavily criticized by Republican opponents and the Israeli government since it was announced, in part because it offers economic sanction relief to Iran in exchange for compliance.
""For Iran to cheat, it would need a secret source for every single aspect of its program,"" Obama said.  
The speech, to which Obama was 38 minutes late and which lasted over an hour, was the third time he has spoken on AU’s campus as president, the most visits of any sitting president. It was well-attended by foreign dignitaries and media, including Chinese Ambassador to the US, Cui TianKai and many members of Israeli press. 
AU students and staff from all schools in the University also attended, with each school allocated tickets to engage the AU community, according to James Goldgeier, Dean of the School of International Service. SIS earlier emailed its students about a lottery to attend.
“I’m not usually one for politics, but just being a part of this historic moment was amazing,” said Maddie Weyand-Geise, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences. 
Weyand-Geise said that before she was contacted by her advisor to attend the event she knew very little about the deal or the issues surrounding it. 
“I’m more of an arts person, but the invitation prompted me to do some research and now I am very interested in the issue,” she said. 
Student Government President Sasha Gilthorpe said the event was a boon for the University.
“The fact that President Obama chose American University is a huge testament to the community we are all a part of,” she said. “History takes place here.” 
Obama directed his speech at critics of the deal, stressing what he described as a strong US-Israel relationship, the need to maintain peace in the region and ultimately urging Congress to accept the deal in its September vote. 
At one point the president compared Republican critics to Iranian hardliners who may be filmed yelling “Death to America!” and who he said similarly oppose the deal. He also called out pundits he said had become “armchair scientists” by contradicting the expertise of Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, who is also nuclear physicist and was involved in drafting the deal. 
He encouraged Israeli detractors to accept the deal.
""Every nation of the world that has commented publicly, with the exception of the Israeli government has expressed support."" #ObamaAtAU
— The Eagle (@TheEagleOnline) August 5, 2015
""To the Israeli people I say this: a nuclear armed #iran is far more dangerous to #Israel"" @POTUS #ObamaAtAU
— The Eagle (@TheEagleOnline) August 5, 2015
Throughout the speech, Obama rejected the notion that the United States should turn down the current agreement in hopes of a better deal that might have included stronger sanctions. 
“Sanctions alone are not going to force Iran to completely dismantle all vestiges of its nuclear infrastructure,” he said. ""Those who say we can walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy.” 
Rejection of the deal would mean the exhaustion of all alternatives to military action, he said. Obama repeatedly pounded the importance of avoiding another war in the Middle East, noting that the only militant organizations have benefited from recent wars in the region. 
“The emergence of Al Qaeda in Iraq has evolved into ISIL and ironically, the single greatest beneficiary from the region...was the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he said, using an acronym for the group more commonly known as the Islamic State. 
Iran does have a history of supporting militant groups in the region. The president argued that while some funds will continue to go to uses the US government does not approve of, the economic relief the release of sanctions will supply will not impact that funding as much as is being discussed. 
In fact, Iran has engaged in such activities before sanctions began.  
The current deal prevents Iran from obtaining plutonium, enriched uranium, removes two-thirds of the country’s centrifuges and allows decades of inspector access to the nuclear supply chain.  
""Nuclear material isn't something you can hide in the closet. It can leave a trace for years,” he said. “We can catch them and we will,"" he said.

2015-11-12,AU,Israel,"*Updated: 5:09 p.m. Nov. 14. Corrections and clarification appended. 
The discovery of posters bearing Islamophobic messages on campus Sunday evening has raised concerns about the safety of Muslim students.
The posters mentioned chapters of the Muslim Students Association and Students for Justice in Palestine. One depicts deceased al-Qaeda member Anwar al-Awlaki with a target over his face. The picture on the poster is surrounded by the words, “MSA Terrorist: Head of al-Qaeda in Yemen, President MSA Colorado State” and the hashtag “#StopTheJihadOnCampus.” A 2010 New York Times article confirms that al-Awlaki attended Colorado State, and was the president of the MSA chapter there.
Another poster, which bears the same hashtag, shows a bloody knife hovering over a Jewish star under the words, “The real meaning of BDS: Boycott, Divest, Stab.” This phrase draws a reference to “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions,” a strategy used by Students for Justice in Palestine chapters and other organizations to protest Israel’s political treatment of the Palestinian territories. 
Students found two posters in the tunnel next to Bender Arena and four more on lampposts between Kogod and Katzen.
Aman Abdelhamid, the president of AU’s MSA chapter, said she felt severely troubled by the posters. 
“We’ve been dealing with [Islamophobia] our entire lives, but to come to a school and to have fliers posted like that with threatening images…it’s just so upsetting,” Abdelhamid said.
The posters are linked to “Stop the Jihad on Campus,” a campaign funded by the California-based David Horowitz Freedom Center. A statement that the Office of Campus life e-mailed to the student body Tuesday afternoon connected the posters to the Freedom Center, and the group’s website claims the organization “combats the efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country as it attempts to defend itself in a time of terror.” 
Horowitz’s materials have appeared on campuses across the country, according to Abdelhamid.
Members of the MSA and SJP found a 44-page manifesto on the website for the “Stop the Jihad on Campus” campaign. The document claims that MSA recruits for al-Qaeda and Hamas. None of this is true, according to Laith Shakir, treasurer of AU’s SJP chapter. Both organizations’ budgets are financed through AU Club Council, he said.
“Not only is all of the information presented here categorically false, it also propagates an exhausted talking point: if you are (or even just look) Muslim, and you're involved in campus organization, you must also be involved in a terrorist group,” Shakir wrote in a Facebook post Sunday night. “Thus, Muslims and people who ‘look Arab’ are inextricably linked to violent extremism. The promoted hashtag isn't trying to just ‘stop the jihad’ (which, itself, is a nonsensical phrase); instead, it's trying to eradicate anyone who could conceivably be labeled as Arab or Muslim from organizing on campus.”
Shakir was one of several students who shared pictures of the flyer on Facebook. Many urged their peers to report the incident to Public Safety. Some also offered to walk with Muslim students who did not feel safe traveling alone, Mokuena said. 
The posters have made Muslim students feel unsafe, according to Abdelhamid.
“I had people calling me [on Sunday], telling me that they were legitimately scared,” she said. “The posters…had really strong implications, really threatening messages.”
The discovery of the posters coincided with instances of Islamophobia on other campuses in the DMV area, Abdelhamid said. The same posters were recently spotted on the Georgetown and George Washington University campuses. At Virginia Tech, students found the message, “On 11/11, we will kill all the Muslims,” written on a bathroom stall, Abdelhamid said. 
The fact that the posters originated from an outside organization, Abdelhamid said, will not be comforting until the people who put them up are identified. 
“The thing is, we don’t know who posted these flyers,” she said. “It was definitely on behalf of that organization, but we don’t know if they sent people from the organization to come on campuses, or whether they recruited actual students.”
On Sunday night, SJP president Ntebo Mokuena brought one of the posters found in the tunnel to the Public Safety office, where she filed a written report. An officer escorted her to the tunnel to take down the other poster there and walked with her to MGC to look for more. She said she was told that officers would be available to escort any students across campus, and that they would search the campus for more posters.
Members of the MSA and SJP raised concerns about the posters in a meeting with representatives from the Kay Spiritual Life Center, Public Safety, Student Activities and the Office of Campus Life Monday afternoon. 
Although officers assured Mokuena and others Sunday night that they would find and remove as many posters as they could, Attai said she saw three posters on lampposts near Kogod, and one on the traffic box near Glover Gate, on Monday morning. Three Public Safety officers were standing near the one on the traffic box, she said, so she assumed it would be taken down. When she passed by the area three hours later, the officers were gone, and the poster was still there. She and a friend took it down themselves, despite fears of being targeted by the people who put them up. Attai said she removed the three on the lampposts as well.
AU Director of Public Relations Kelly Alexander said in an email that the officers did not remove the poster on the traffic box because it was “crazy glued” down, and the traffic box was city property. To avoid damaging the box, Alexander said, the officers requested that the city take the poster down.
Alexander said that a Public Safety officer removed additional posters on the quad near Kogod.
She said that between Sunday and Monday, any poster that Public Safety officers saw or were made aware of were taken down. Posters left up either went unreported or were put up after officers patrolled the area.
Public Safety did not issue an independent public statement or AU alert, despite requests from MSA and SJP members. The University did release a statement on Facebook and Twitter shortly after the posters were discovered.
""AU Public Safety has been doing a really good job reaching out to us and being proactive in terms of dealing with this whole issue. The head of PS has now met with us for the second time to ensure and work with us that our safety and well-being is secure,"" Attai said.
However, both SJP and MSA members said they were concerned by the University’s lack of protocol for dealing with hate speech.
“The University had good intentions, but they said a lot of what is going to be done is going to happen through the community,” Abdelhamid said. “And I understand that … community involvement and awareness is a huge part of the whole situation, but the administration needs to do their part. We need to know that the University knows how to deal with these kinds of threats.”
Shakir said he was also troubled by the University’s response.
“As students and members of a marginalized community, we didn’t know where to go after being specifically targeted with violent messages,” he said. “Part of our hope is that this will serve as a case study for the University going forward, to have a protocol in place to allow students to know how the University will respond to hate crimes before that happens, and to serve as a sort of preventative measure.”
Gail Hanson, the vice president of Campus Life, said AU does not have a hate speech policy. There is a set of Freedom of Expression Guidelines, which she said outlines the cases in which the University can intervene in student speech. 
“Protest or demonstration shall not be discouraged so long as neither force nor the threat of force is used, and so long as the orderly processes of the University are not deliberately obstructed,” the policy states. 
Prohibited “expressions of dissent” include those that “deny or infringe upon the rights of other students, faculty, staff, or guests of the University community…disrupt or interfere with educational or other activities of the University community…[or] endanger the safety of any person on the University campus.”
The guidelines do not apply to people from outside the AU community, Hanson said. In accordance with University policy, only students, staff and faculty are allowed to place posters on campus. The organizations or individuals responsible for the content must make their names visible on all posted materials. Posters put up by outsiders will be removed, Hanson said. 
Shakir said the posters are “emblematic of a much larger mentality” of animosity toward SJP chapters and Islamophobia.
This is not the first time AU’s SJP chapter has encountered hostility, according to Mokuena. She said that the group’s posters are frequently defaced or ripped down.
The MSA, SJP, the University and AU Hillel have issued statements condemning the posters. 
“I am profoundly upset and displeased at the inflammatory posters that went up over the weekend,” University Chaplain Joe Eldridge said in an interview. “It is incumbent on us as an American University community to surround our Muslim brothers and sisters with compassion.”

Correction: An earlier version of this article misattributed the New York Times article and stated that Anwar al-Awlaki was not president of an MSA chapter. He was, at Colorado State.
An earlier version of this article also misstated the number of posters Attai saw near Kogod.
Clarification: This article has been updated with additional information about Public Safety and the University's responses to the posters. It previously said that Pubic Safety did not release a statement, which they did not do independently around the time the posters were found. Campus police were referred to in some statements made by the University shortly after.

2016-10-13,AU,Israel,"I believe it is appropriate, and even ironic due to the fact we attend American University, to discuss America. Gallup polls have questioned the average United States citizen asking, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud?” Based off of this polling, the percentage of Americans to answer ‘extremely proud’ has dropped from 70 percent in 2003 to 52 percent this year. Not only is this an 18 percent drop, but this is the lowest number that has ever been polled.
Much of the negativity that has recently permeated the country is due to renewed conversations on the effects of extensive military involvement abroad, the decline in rank of our education and healthcare systems, and our mass incarceration rates that are the highest in the world. Although there is an abundant amount of other statistics that could further confirm the state of ‘mayhem’ that the United States currently resides in, I will attempt to reverse some of this negativity by demonstrating the many ways the United States still remains number one.
Despite recent economic recession and stagnant growth, we still have the world’s largest GDP. According to the World Bank, our GDP last year was 17.95 trillion dollars. Second place was China at 10.87 trillion. Our GDP is higher than third place Japan, fourth place Germany, fifth place United Kingdom, sixth place France, seventh place India and eighth place Italy combined. Somehow, someway, the United States remains the economic powerhouse of the world. Along with the GDP, the United States household spending is the highest in the world. We consume over 25 percent of the world’s household consumption. One out of every four goods that are consumed go to someone in the United States. This makes us the number one consumer market in the world – and by far.
We also help feed the world. When it comes to overall food production, we lag behind China and India. Our country does lead in corn production and other specific foods, but when it comes to overall food production we rank third. Under the topic of food exports, the United States takes the lead. We export $118.3 billion worth of food every year, more than any other country. That being said, even though America is notorious for having high rates of obesity, every two years at the Olympics we show just how fit we are. We have the most gold medals (1,022), the most silver medals (794), the most bronze medals (704) and the most medals total (2,520). Our gold medal count is higher than the total medal count of every other country, not including the former Soviet Union.
The military remains the most well-funded military to ever inhabit the earth. The military spending dwindled from $700 billion to the $600 billion that it averages around now. This extreme expense allows for technological advancement and progress to outperform any of our expectations. We were the first country to create a nuclear weapon and continue to innovate when it comes to our military might. On top of this, our defense spending outdoes the next 20 countries on the list combined. Furthermore, when we think about the United States and its work abroad, we must remember that we are the country that contributes to more foreign aid than any other nation. 34 billion dollars in foreign aid is distributed to over 100 different nations. The nation we currently give the most federal aid to is Israel. Just about half of the nations worldwide receive the benefit of U.S. foreign aid.
Just taking a look around the American University campus, this next piece should not be a surprise. Students from foreign countries flock to colleges and universities in the United States because of the quality of education this country provides. The United States holds 181 of the top 750 best universities in the world, compared to second place China which consists of 57 of the top 750 top universities. Even when it comes to music, films, literature or any other part of American culture, we tend to have the most global influence in the world. Any country you visit will most likely play music and watch movies that originate from the United States.
So, if I were to ever be polled with the question of, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud,” I would firmly answer extremely proud. We may have our setbacks and flaws, but looking at how far we have come and where we stand in the world today, the United States is the greatest country in the world.

2017-10-11,AU,Israel,"As I witnessed what happened on campus last month, I had one overriding thought: we have seen this before.  We have seen torch-bearing, swastika-clad demonstrators in Charlottesville this past August.  We have seen ugly, crass racial slurs on AU’s campus earlier this year, and we have seen an unrelenting barrage of violent acts and words on the national stage over the last few years.  Rather than appreciating that the United States is special because of its diversity and freedom, the purveyors of hate speech and violence hope to divide our country further.  But we have seen this before, so, with the right approach, we can frustrate their aims.

	The menacing crowd of white supremacists and anti-semites marching with their torches in Charlottesville was particularly jarring for many people, as it combined elements of Nazism and lynch mobs.  Those of us who believe fervently that past is prologue, and that knowledge of history is essential to understanding our present, know that masquerading as perpetrators of the Holocaust or as henchmen of Klan violence should not be dismissed as mere swagger; words and images do matter.  The Nazi Holocaust, which resulted in the inconceivable murder of six million Jews – two out of every three European Jews – during World War II, owed much of its effectiveness to the fact that it began by separating and dehumanizing Jews and others deemed undesirable by the regime. The kind of imagery employed by the criminal who violated AU last week has some goals in common with the Nazis: to liken certain groups of people to animals, to promote a fictional glorious version of a corrupt system, and to encourage fear of the stranger in our midst.

	Already, before the latest incident, AU had taken the rare initiative to found an Anti-Racist Research and Policy Center, headed by Dr. Ibram X. Kendi.  On an evening that should only have been celebratory, with detailed plans announced for the new center, insidious posters were hung in strategic locations – including the offices of the Center for Israel Studies – valorizing the Confederacy while proudly evoking its support for slavery in the cotton industry. In his beautiful and wise remarks to the campus community after the vandalism was revealed, Dr. Kendi acknowledged the wider circle of hurt that such acts create, specifically recognizing Jewish students as being victims of the same kind of anti-semitic, white supremacist agenda as the African-American community on campus and elsewhere.  “I write to AU students,” he proclaimed, “especially students of color and Jewish students.”

	As scholars of the Jewish experience, my colleagues and I know too well the Jewish people’s long history of being targeted by the type of hate and base prejudice that was demonstrated at AU last week.  But we also know the Jews’ history of activism – of resisting those who attack people because of their race, religion, or background, and of fighting for the rights of those victims.  This includes, in particular, a history of empathy with the African-American community and activism even at the risk of some Jews’ lives – from the turn of the 20th century, through the Depression era, and famously in the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s.  Jews have learned, in every era, that it is not enough to condemn hate crimes with words – but that informed action is the key to change. In my Jewish history and literature courses, I seek to inform about a history that is often difficult but remains proud, and to show our students that it is not enough to know, but also to speak out, provide support for victims, and expose hypocrisy and prejudice.

	I was struck by the following lines in Dr. Kendi’s remarks: “Courage is not the absence of fear. It is the strength to do what is right in the face of it.”  The same closeness that makes relationships more intense on a college campus, but can spread fear and despair much more quickly than in a normal community, can also provide the key to our solution.  If the University continues to respond, as it has, with creativity and openness – to different ideas and different people – if its faculty and students join together to learn, applying lessons from the past to our complicated present, then we will be fulfilling our mission, and we will join those who meet fear with courage.

	Dr. Lauren B. Strauss is a Scholar in Residence and Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Jewish Studies Program at American University.

2018-03-08,AU,Israel,"Students meet outside of Hillel's office in Kay Spiritual Life Center.
Correction appended.
The University is hosting a series of seminars on anti-Semitism following the anti-Semitic posters hung on the School of International Service building on Tuesday, Feb. 27. The next event, open to students, faculty and staff, will be on March 28 and focus on anti-Semitism at the University.
These meetings are part of a new strategy to address hateful postering, Vice President of Campus Life Fanta Aw told The Eagle Monday. AU chose not to host a town hall after the anti-immigration posters in January and the anti-Semitic posters in February. This marks a change from fall 2017, when the University hosted a campus-wide town hall in Kay Spiritual Life Center after someone hung Confederate flag flyers in several campus buildings. 
“One of things we learned about the town hall in September is that after you’ve had a series of these, if you’re going to do anything, you need to focus on the education piece of it,” Aw said. 
The Anti-Defamation League met with University leaders during summer 2017 to teach them about responding to hate incidents like white supremacist postering, Doron Ezickson, the organization’s D.C. regional director, told The Eagle in February. Campuses can limit hate by “engaging people with knowledge,” Ezickson said. They should not give white supremacist groups the attention they seek, Ezickson said. 
Aw’s campus-wide email and the announcement of community check-ins matches this philosophy. 
“Part of our response is to not give these groups attention, which is what they want, and we want you to know we are being as proactive as we possibly can,” she wrote in her statement.
Steph Black, a Jewish student, said that Aw’s statement is a signal of larger anti-Semitism at the University. Anti-Semitism is not discussed enough, she said. 
“There are a lot of ways to say that these were Neo-Nazis,” Black said. “These were raging anti-Semites. These are people who do not believe Jews are humans and there are ways to phrase things that say who they are without necessarily naming them.”
Joshua Hare, a junior studying law and society, is the Shabbat innovation intern for Hillel. He is not an official representative of Hillel. Hare thought that Aw’s email was a standard reply for white supremacist postering; however, he was impressed by the scheduling of the community meetings
“To me, I find some importance in not identifying certain actors sometimes,” Hare said. “While I understand that some other students would like to know who posted them and more about the organization, to me the University’s priority should be responding to students about how they’re feeling and about how it makes them feel safe on campus.”
Rose Haas, a sophomore majoring in Jewish studies, also told The Eagle that educating students on anti-Semitism is a positive step. However, she would have liked to see Operation Homeland named in the University’s statement. Operation Homeland, a group connected to white supremacist Richard Spencer, was written on the posters.
“It would behoove the school to explicitly name the groups that are problematic,” Haas said.
Anti-Semitism education sessions scheduled for before, after spring break
The two community meetings were both “inward” and “outward” facing events, junior Steph Black told The Eagle. 
Black met with Aw to set up the meetings, she said. Aw had already reached out to the Anti-Defamation League to plan an educational seminar on anti-Semitism before she met with Black, she told The Eagle via email. The same day the posters were hung on the University's campus, the Anti-Defamation League released a report that anti-Semitic incidents surged in 2017. Aw wanted to plan a seminar on anti-Semitism with the Anti-Defamation League in response to the posters. Black urged Aw to hold more educational sessions on anti-Semitism to change how the University approaches the topic, she said.
The inward facing event, open just to Jewish students, was on March 6 in the AU Hillel office. Hillel is the campus Jewish student organization. The outward facing event was on March 7 for all students in the Center for Diversity and Inclusion’s office.
There will be another event on March 28 where students can learn about anti-Semitism at the University. This will be open for AU students, faculty and staff.
“Often anti-Semitism is not seen as a legitimate form of oppression and not seen as a legitimate concern,” Black said. “Jewish students don’t get the support they need when dealing with this.” 
With this new focus on education – and not town halls – the meetings will serve as a way to have a conversation and educate others on anti-Semitism on campus, Aw said. 
“We heard from our Jewish community and I’ve spent some time with Hillel,” Aw said. “I think the way that we can get to this is let’s have community dialogue around the rise in anti-Semitism, what do we know is happening and how does it play itself out in different ways and how do we as a community respond in the most appropriate ways.”
Aaron Traub, a sophomore in the School of Communication, said that town halls are often coupled with protests. One-on-one conversations like these community check-ins provide a less risky, quieter environment to process the postering.
“One-on-one conversations not only limit the risk involved in a protest, but they allow students and faculty to be in an environment where they are free to express their concerns and opinions as well as become more aware of the global issue of anti-Semitism on college campuses,” Traub said.
Scott Boxer, president of AU Students for Israel and a sophomore in the School of International Service, said that the posters disguised anti-Semitism as a criticism of Israel, Boxer said. The decision to hold smaller educational sessions on anti-Semitism instead of a town hall is positive, he said, because town halls provide notoriety for anti-Semitic hate groups.
“Obviously, this was a very disgusting or hateful act. But, this one thankfully didn’t include any personal threats of violence against a specific person or a specific group,” Boxer said. “It wasn’t threatening somebody’s life. There wasn’t that feeling of urgency to have a big town hall with every member of administration and massive amounts of students.”
Along with Black, the Center for Diversity and Inclusion and AU Hillel are coordinating these events. Last semester, Hillel and CDI partnered on a workshop for Jewish student leaders, Executive Director of AU Hillel Jason Benkendorf said. 
This semester, beyond the meetings on anti-Semitism, they’re hosting a faculty and staff workshop titled “Building Relationships Across Difference” with Jewish activist Yavilah McCoy on March 19, who will also be speaking on campus on March 20. McCoy will host another workshop called “Allyship While Jewish” on March 21.
According to Dialogue & Diversity Programs Coordinator Michelle Strange, the meetings will be a way to process where the AU community is at with anti-Semitism.
“Now that these posters have been hung up, how do we take what we already have and refocus it?” Strange said. “Processing our feelings, our thoughts and how we build solidarity and how we move forward, what’s the connection and what’s the difference between having a critique on Israel versus being anti-semitic?”
A handful of Jewish students came to the inward event Tuesday, Benkendorf said. He wants these meetings to give Jewish students an opportunity to express their feelings on anti-Semitism and their experience at the University, he said. He hopes students will brainstorm ideas to address anti-Semitism and bigotry during the check-ins.
“It is really important to me that folks understand that on campus and beyond campus, AU really is by and large a really wonderful place to be a Jewish student,” Benkendorf said. “There’s a lot of positive things going on, we’ve got an active and vibrant community. Having an event like this doesn’t change that, but it’s certainly something we have to work through together.”
Correction: The original version of this article mislabeled the third anti-Semitism event on March 28 as a speaker event. The third event will not feature a speaker. Instead, it will be another educational discussion on anti-Semitism.

2018-03-09,AU,Israel,"Students meet outside of Hillel's office in Kay Spiritual Life Center.
On February 27, American University Police Department officers removed anti-Semitic posters from campus. The flyers contained the hashtag, #AIPACgohome, and an Operation Homeland logo. The Eagle spotted the flyers on the School of International Service building at about 2 a.m.
First, The Eagle strongly affirms its support for the Jewish community at American University. 
The posters addressed AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. AIPAC is a large bipartisan, pro-Israel organization. Beginning last Sunday, more than 18,000 pro-Israel supporters attended the conference, according to the event’s website. Many of them are Jewish.
A critical observation of the posters, however, reveals they offer a targeted, hateful anti-Semitic message disguised by anti-Israel sentiment. The University has a large Jewish population. Twelve percent of the University's class of 2022, for example, identifies as Jewish, according to a breakdown provided by the Kay Spiritual Life Center. The posters, which list the name of a group of white supremacists connected with Richard Spencer, clearly target Jews and not exclusively Israel. 
As these events happen, it seems that the University’s response and consequently the student community response decreases. Formerly, hateful events like these -- such as the Confederate flags hung on campus in September -- elicited town hall community meetings. But, no longer does that seem to be the case. In an interview with Fanta Aw, vice president of campus life, The Eagle learned that the University’s primary strategy is to deny attention to white supremacist groups hanging posters like these. They do so with the advice of the Anti-Defamation League.   
Our staff agrees that the University should deny oxygen to white supremacist groups. Town halls, for example, provide too much attention to these groups. We also look forward to learning more about anti-Semitism through University-hosted seminars. 
However, the school has not been transparent about this shift away from town halls. They did not publicly announce why they neglected to host a town hall after the anti-immigration posters were hung in January and after the anti-Semitic posters were hung in February. In the case of the anti-Semitic posters, the University opted to host discussions on anti-Semitism instead of a town hall. Publicly, however, the University produced a rapid, cookie-cutter memo after the anti-Semitic posters were hung. This only reinforces the image of an administration that is disconnected from the student body. Through our reporting, The Eagle knows that the
University is acting on anti-Semitism behind the scenes and has published that information. However, the school is not publicly communicating their actions clearly. 
This can make Jewish students feel undervalued because it seems like the University isn’t taking bigotry against them as seriously as other forms of hatred. In the coming weeks, we hope the University will publicly explain the criteria for a town hall meeting and what makes this particular anti-Semitic postering (in addition the anti-immigration posters) different to the student body. We also hope they will further explain their strategy to deny these white supremacist groups the attention they seek.
Additionally, students feel left out of decision-making discussions, treated solely as assets rather than active members of change in the community. Jewish community members should be consulted on how the University moves forward from these anti-Semitic posters. Jews are as worthy as any other marginalized group of the University’s attention.
The Eagle recommends that University improve its communication with the student body, specifically the Jewish community, about their approach to anti-Semitism and white supremacist postering as a whole. They could do so through face-to-face conversations with students. Burwell recently wrote, “It truly takes a village to build a more inclusive community.” These events are no exception. It is time to include more student voices in the building process and be transparent with your actions.

2020-11-13,AU,Israel,"Palestinian social justice event flyer. 
An Arab and Muslim studies professor from San Francisco State University joined American University students for a virtual event on Oct. 29 entitled “The Palestinian Exception to Calls for Social Justice.” 
Rabab Abdulhadi discussed calls for Palestinian human rights in the United States. AU professors Irene Calis and Zein El-Amine co-hosted the event, which Calis referred to as a call for justice.
“It is about the real material consequences of working towards the emancipation of Palestinian life, land and dignity,” Calis said.
Abdulhadi said that people should recognize that criticism of Israel is not the same as anti-Semitism. 
“Israel should not get exceptional treatment because Israel is not exceptional. Palestine is not exceptional,” Abdulhadi said. “The U.S. is not exceptional, and we argue against exceptionalism. This is a question of justice.”
Abdulhadi also discussed her experience fighting against censorship in her line of work and activism. 
The conversation was co-sponsored by various student groups, including but not limited to Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), African Students’ Organization and AU Pride. The Department of Sociology and the Department of Critical Race, Gender, and Culture Studies served as academic sponsors of the event. 
Junior Kiran Waqar, a member of SJP, said that the number of co-sponsors was significant in representing the interconnected concern for justice in Palestine, which many students at AU feel passionate about. 
“It can be difficult for a lot of people on American University's campus when they feel like their values aren’t seen in a lot of places,” Waqar said. “I think a really big part of [the event] is community building and showing people that they can speak up for what they believe is right and that they have other people supporting them.”
Junior Aqsa Rashid, also a member of SJP, said another goal of the event was to paint Palestine in a light that students don’t often see at AU, one devoid of the logistics of policy that might constrain conversation and debate. 
“We're not approaching it from that lens,” Rashid said. “We're approaching it like how we can come together as a community that cares about people and justice.” 
Abdulhadi also spoke about how to keep going when activism work becomes frustrating or hopeless. Abdulhadi advised thinking of this work as a “labor of love.”
“Think of what we're doing as coming together to enrich and support each other,” Abdulhadi said. “Of course, it's exhausting to do all of this stuff, day in and day out. But what option do we have? What choice do we have?”
In reflecting on the event, Waqar found Abdulhadi’s words to be a revitalizing path to justice. 
“It's hard to have energy after a long day and on a Team call, but I did,” Waqar said, referring to Microsoft Teams. “I had energy because there was hope, and that hope is a return to self. This was one of the most effective, genuine events I've been to on campus. It felt like I could finally breathe; I didn't realize how much I was holding on my chest.”

2021-04-12,AU,Israel,"Michael Brenner, American University’s Director of the Center for Israel Studies, received the first Salo W. and Jeannette M. Baron Award for Scholarly Excellence in Research on the Jewish Experience. 
Brenner’s research focuses on the State of Israel and Jewish history from the 19th to the 21st century. His multiple publications and books have been translated into 10 languages. A few of his books focus on German Jewish history in the 1920s, which he said is extremely significant today. 
“I think that this aspect of history, unfortunately, has become more relevant in the United States, than what I thought when I started to work on it initially,” Brenner said. “It shows how democracies can fail and how certain groups can be singled out and blamed for economic or political crises. Today, unfortunately, I see certain rhymes to that history.”
AU’s Center for Israel Studies was established in 1998, the first of its kind. The center has created a space to study, examine and interpret Israel’s landscape as a nation and its people. 
“At AU and CIS, we have excellent relations with many different schools and departments, allowing us to do unique interdisciplinary work,” Brenner said. “At the center, we are able to interact with both high-level scholars and politicians for collaborative research and discussion.”
The award was established in 2020 by the University of Vienna and the Knapp Family Foundation, a nonprofit that fosters diverse education in minority communities. The University of Vienna describes the award as the Nobel Prize in the study of the Jewish experience. The Baron Award recognizes and honors the achievements of researchers whose works focus on the relationship of Jewish and non-Jewish people and perceptions of Judaism in the broader societies in which they live. 
The award was named after Salo Wittmayer Baron, who is widely considered to be the greatest Jewish historian of the 20th century. He is best known for his 18-volume magnum opus “A Social and Religious History of the Jews.” As the first professor to be appointed as the Chair of Jewish History at Columbia University, Baron testified at the trial of Adolf Eichmann, one of the major organizers of the Holocaust, where he explained the sociohistorical context of the genocide against Jewish people. Baron’s work strove to integrate the aspects of Jewish history into the wider history of the eras and societies in which they lived. According to Brenner, his scholarship is the groundwork for understanding how Jewish people in Israel and worldwide continue to perceive themselves and others today. 
Brenner continues to serve as a professor of Jewish History and Culture at the University of Munich, where he teaches a semester every year. He had the opportunity to meet Baron during his graduate studies at Columbia University. 
“I was honored to visit him when he was 94 years old, where I got to know him. Personally, I am very touched to be the first recipient of the award that was named after him,” Brenner said. “I am also very attached to the fact that Baron and I both shared experiences of having our lives and academic careers be between Europe and the U.S.” 
In the future, Brenner hopes to study Israeli-Arab relations further and create unique global programs for the Center for Israel Studies.  
Brenner encourages non-Jewish students to participate in Jewish and Israel Studies, where students see the intersection of identities to understand other experiences.  
“Jewish studies is here for everyone,” Brenner said. “For non-Jewish students, it is an opportunity to learn about their own families’ experiences as immigrants or minorities by looking at the Jewish experience in the last 200 years. Rather than being isolationist and looking at one’s own, I think we should understand the relations between two or more groups throughout history and today.”

2022-02-11,AU,Israel,"Tzipi Livni, the former Vice Premier, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice for Israel, spoke to American University students in a webinar co-sponsored by the School of Public Affairs and the Center for Israel Studies on Feb. 7.
Livni was the featured speaker at this year’s Amos Perlmutter Memorial Lecture, an annual event held to commemorate Perlmutter, a late scholar of Middle East political leadership and SPA professor.
According to the Center for Israel Studies, Livni is “known for her efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was Israel’s chief negotiator for peace between Israel and the Palestinians during the last two rounds of negotiations.”
The question and answer portion of the webinar was moderated by Saul Newman, the associate dean for Undergraduate Education in the Department of Government at AU.
During the webinar, Livni said she decided to leave politics three years ago after feeling she did not have enough political power to promote continued peace talks between Israel and Palestine.
“This is the right policy for the future of both my sons, but also their generation,” Livni said. “I hope that the time will come and we will see this happening, because the other option, I believe, is not the Zionist option.”
Livni also discussed the “huge gap” between the state of Israel and its perception by the international community.
“For many years, the outside world is looking at Israel through the lenses of the [Palestinian and Israeli] conflict, [and the] sometimes distorted lenses of the conflict,” Livni said. “It also affects the situation in Israel. The nature of democracy, the policy of some Israeli governments affects the relations between Israel and the world. And I believe that we need to open a new dialogue.”
Prior to the event, AU Students for Justice in Palestine released a statement condemning the lecture and Livni’s involvement. As of Feb. 10, the statement has been co-signed by 12 AU student organizations, such as AU Pride, the South Asian Student Association and the Arab Student Association.
According to the AUSJP statement, when Livni was a “key” member of former Isreali Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s cabinet, they led a 2008 assault on the Gaza Strip called Operation Cast Lead. The operation led to the deaths of 1400 Palestinians, including 300 children. 
“We call on the university to cancel this lecture and to reckon with its unapologetic support of this settler-colonial and apartheid state, including the disproportionate amount of resources it contributed to an Israeli-centric, and anti-Palestinian, education,” the statement said. “Students for Justice in Palestine will continue to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people until such demands are met and the liberation for all Palestinians is realized.”
AUSJP did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Eagle.
When asked where she draws the line between disagreement with Israeli policy and antisemitism, Livni said that while critizing the Israeli government is legitimate, not accepting the right of Israel to exist is “something completely different.”
“I think that the base is understanding that the Jewish people [have] the rights, historical tradition and international rights to establish and to live in the nation-state of the Jewish people,” Livni said.

2022-11-10,AU,Israel,"Palestinian writer and spoken word poet Ghadeer Malek shared her work in an online event hosted by American University’s Arab World Studies and Georgetown University's Center for Contemporary Arab Studies on Nov. 1.  
During the discussion moderated by AU Director of Arab World Studies Irene Calis, Malek talked about tackling subjects like displacement, feminism and settler-colonialism as a Palestinian woman. The talk also included poets Shano Mohammed, a Georgetown student in the Master of Arts in Arab Studies program, and AU student Satreen Hendi.  
The event is the second installment of the online speaker series, “Palestine: Land, Life, Dignity,” a collaborative initiative aimed at centering anti-colonial struggles and protecting similar stories from erasure. Malek said portraying this reality and relating it to a larger picture is the basis of her work.  
“What drove me to poetry was the need to express ourselves as Palestinians in particular,” Malek said at the event. “I always joke around with my friends that Palestinians are gaslit from the moment they’re born in the sense that … we’re born into a reality in which [our experience of colonialism] is completely erased.”  
Malek added that poetry, specifically spoken word, has become a vehicle for expressing her anger and resilience at the damage colonialism has inflicted on Palestinian and other Indigenous communities.  
“A lot of my voice at the beginning came out as rants because I was angry as a young Palestinian; angry at the world, angry at colonization,” she said. “I wanted my voice to be heard … and that sort of anger was channeled into spoken word.”  
Born in Palestine, Malek immigrated to Canada in 2003 to study at the University of Toronto, where she became active in student movements supporting Palestinian causes. Her body of work includes the poems “I Exist,” “Revolution to My Earth” and the anthology book “Min Fami: Arab Feminist Reflections of Identity, Space & Resistance,” a collection of writing from multiple authors. Malek said having multiple voices was an integral part of the book.  
“The more voices that come to the table the better they are,” she said, adding that gathering writers from various religious and cultural backgrounds helped her form a community. “That’s why I’m very proud of ‘Min Fami’ … I don’t feel like I’m a single voice talking on my own.”  
In an example of gathering different voices, Mohammed and Hendi both shared poems about overcoming cultural and institutional barriers. Mohammed, who was born in Iraqi Kurdistan, recited her poem about the limitations placed on women in the Middle, East and Sateen delivered a poem centered around the death of Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian journalist killed by Israeli police in May.  
“This is one of my process pieces where I start with an idea or a phrase or something and see where it takes me,” Hendi said. “I talk about the frustration of what it feels like to have to deal with the trauma and the pain of experiencing that situation in real time while also trying to convince people to care about it.”  
While spreading awareness about difficult topics is a central part of her work, Malek said she still grapples with self-doubt about her identity and qualifications as a writer.  
“It’s always a lot of questions and a lot of hesitations in the sense that there’s always a voice underneath our voice … there’s always another voice there questioning,” she said. “I like to call that voice the doubtful voice, the colonizer’s voice, the oppressor’s voice telling us that we’re not good enough.”  
Malek said she combats these feelings by reminding herself, and other Palestinian activists, that her lived experience is more powerful than her doubts. 
“Follow that voice of what you know, because when you write about what you know, the hesitations will still be there … but you can override that voice because you know something that voice doesn’t know, which is that you’re Palestinian,” she said. “Always acknowledge that that voice will come, but you have an inherent knowledge that you can tap into.”

2009-02-12,AU,Palestine,"Two AU clubs on opposite sides of the political spectrum, Students for Justice in Palestine and AU Students for Israel, tabled on the main quad Tuesday on behalf of one cause: Frisbee.
Chelsea Lund, a senior in the School of International Service, brought together many of AU's clubs to support the union of sports and conflict resolution. Ultimate Peace is an organization that promotes peace in the Middle East through Frisbee games.
""[Ultimate Frisbee] is about the team on both sides, supporting each other,"" she said. ""If there's a foul called, you admit it; it's about honesty and it's about working with your teammates and the other team.""
As a member of AU's Ultimate Frisbee team, Lund invited her teammates to play a match at the event, in addition to the several clubs that tabled nearby. OneVoice, an international grassroots movement for negotiation between Palestine and Israel, and AU's Community Action and Social Justice Coalition were also participants.
Most of the clubs at the event participated in activities together previously, but this was the first chance for several of the on-campus clubs focused on  Israel and Palestine issues to co-sponsor a social event, according to Lund.
Rachel Weingartner, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences and a Students for Justice in Palestine member, said the event sounded like a good opportunity. 
Nick Haras, a first-year graduate student in the SIS International Communication program, participated in Students for Justice in Palestine during his four undergraduate years at AU and continues to do so as a graduate student.
""In Lebanon, for example, soccer matches were used prior to the civil war to try to bring Muslim-Christian reconciliation,"" he said. ""Sports allow people to interact with each other and to compete, to get out a lot of energy in a context that doesn't turn violent.""
All the clubs present addressed some aspect of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Lauren Barr, the president of the OneVoice Movement at AU and a sophomore in SIS and CAS, said the OneVoice Movement had not worked with the Ultimate Frisbee team before.
""It's exciting that we've partnered with them, it's kind of fun to cross boundaries that usually aren't related,"" Barr said.
The biggest mishap of the event was a late start, Lund said, but the clubs were able to stay late so students leaving class had a chance to see everything.
""I was excited to see so many people show up for the tabling, that was the part that I thought would be the hardest,"" she said. ""I also got a great Frisbee game going, which was the whole point of the event.""
Lund is also arranging a D.C.-wide Frisbee game March 22 on the National Mall. Club teams and individuals can sign up and pay $10, which will go towards Ultimate Peace.

2010-03-04,AU,Palestine,"This week’s column was difficult to write. Not because of the content, of course - but because of what I had to leave out. I could have written this column about the Women’s Initiative’s new venture, the “Vagina Men” campaign (can I start a “Penis Women” counter-campaign?). But alas, I’ve spilled too much ink whining about feminist follies; this column, instead, will address something of actual consequence.
Twice a week, campus ROTC recruits have to wake up early in the morning to engage in physical training, which will prepare them for their eventual deployment. This task would normally be performed on campus, but our esteemed student government has exiled them to Georgetown. The explanation is thus: AU’s official code prohibits funding to any discriminatory organization. And with the military’s official “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy still in place, alas, what are we to do but ban the presence of the U.S. military?
Leaving aside the fact that the U.S. military has done more to make the world safe for gay people than any do-gooder college activist, let me state emphatically that yes, the military’s policy is asinine. Every civilized country on Earth allows for openly gay soldiers, and it’s a shame that our own military has been slow on the uptake. But it makes little sense to punish our perfectly honorable campus recruits for a policy they have nothing to do with. The only people punished by the student government’s policy are our recruits—most of whom oppose “don’t ask, don’t tell,” anyway.
Really, it is a perfect testament to the fact that the student government is filled with kids playing politician that they think that they’re “sending a message to Washington” this way. Washington’s not listening. Those of you in the Student Government ought to figure out what everyone else on campus knows: you’re not important. Leave our recruits alone and get back to doing what you’re supposed to be doing. Some of you, with your inflated egos, might actually get to be members of Congress one day. Right now, you’re just college kids in a student government. Stop trying to send the Defense Department a statement.
Fascinatingly enough, there actually is something that the SG could do about anti-gay campus culture that falls within their proper purview. If it really wants to cut off funding to campus organizations that promote anti-gay policies, I’ve found one that objectively violates this policy: Students for Justice In Palestine.
This week has been “Israel Apartheid Week” on campuses across the country. Groups such as AU’s own Students for Justice In Palestine have taken part in smear campaigns against the—well, I guess I’m supposed to call it the “Zionist entity” this week—instead standing up for a government that is about as friendly to gays as your humble columnist is to feminists. But I have yet to hear a senator propose cutting off funding to Students for Justice In Palestine, despite the fact that there is only one country in the Middle East where gay men can serve openly: Israel. Try holding a gay pride parade in “Palestine” and see if you can get two feet before your life is endangered. There is simply no comparison between the policies of the two governments toward gays.
I’m not saying that the U.S. military’s policy is fair. I’m just saying that if the student government is going to banish the army from campus, we ought to banish Students for Justice In Palestine, too.
Also Women’s Initiative.

2010-03-04,AU,Palestine,"The harms of a university-subsidized student Metro discount
I am disappointed to see that in the March 1 staff editorial, “This Metro trip: Courtesy of AU?” the staff of The Eagle wishes to obtain a desired WMATA transit discount through the means of a subsidy from the university’s funds. 
As we all should know, money just doesn’t come out of thin air. If a subsidy were to come from WMATA, they would just be offering a lower rate, cutting into their profits but not actually supplying more than a meager amount of money to apply the subsidy. I understand that WMATA cannot do this though, given their trouble finances, among other things. But should AU ever decide to subsidize student transit, the school would need the money to come from somewhere in order to provide the funds—real money. Where would the money come from and how would AU work to make up that lost cost? The same way any business would: raising prices somewhere. So, in theory, we can all pay $100 less a year to ride the Metro, but we can make up for it in paying an extra $100 a year in tuition. 
Of course those who travel the most would benefit from this, but those who don’t travel daily would lose money. The vast majority of students would be losers. I’m very pro-student discount—but not from AU.

Interfaith Council calls for campus-wide tolerance
AU’s Interfaith Council has noticed a disturbing trend lately. Various student organizations have been targeted for their worldviews or social action, we assume by individuals or by other groups.
Most recently, AU Rationalists and Atheists put up posters for their first general meeting, and within a day or two, most if not all the posters were torn down from dorm announcement boards and other sites. It’s our understanding that AURA has been forced to put up with this intolerance on several occasions. And while AURA is not a faith group, they are a student group based on a well-defined worldview, which I believe is something to be respected.
A member of Students for Justice in Palestine has recently informed me that they have had similar experiences with disappearing posters.
This is not so different from the stories we’ve heard of an individual following another student from a faith group and challenging his beliefs endlessly with derogatory terms and accusations. It’s not so different from disrespectful messages and swastikas drawn in spaces shortly before a sacred service is set to take place.
I believe there is a hidden tension on this campus, a weed of disrespect. I like to think that most people are respectful here, and yet repeatedly I see grown adults being intolerant, self-righteous or downright obnoxious. I do not think that we all have to get along or agree, but there is absolutely no good reason for the level of mutual disrespect that we witness, whether it’s between individuals or groups with different worldviews or political beliefs.
Interfaith Council plans to continue to help students, staff and faculty bridge their differences to reach mutual respect and appreciation. We have already informed AU’s chaplains of our concerns, and we are ready to help mediate any conflicts between individuals or groups. I can be contacted personally at al3281a@student.american.edu.

2010-06-02,AU,Palestine,"Individual rights are too important to let partisanship cloud our judgment. Strangely, this is a hard lesson to teach on our nation’s college campuses.
While the Supreme Court considers whether belief-based student organizations deserve equal rights on campus, two more universities have been facing this very issue. Georgetown University is facing it over a pro-choice group, the University of Arizona over a pro-life group. 
At Arizona, Students for Life’s application for official recognition was initially denied because the group requires that its members share beliefs “that life is sacred and that the intentional killing of human beings through abortion, euthanasia, and murder, and that all forms of eugenics are morally reprehensible.”
Yet, a public university bound by the First Amendment may not deny the basic right to freedom of association, and the university quickly reversed its decision. Universities don’t like to be shown up as hypocritical when it comes to freedom of speech or freedom of association.
The shoe is on the other foot at Georgetown University, which has prevented a pro-choice group from receiving fair treatment on campus. Georgetown is a private university not bound by the First Amendment, but it is bound, morally and contractually, by its own promises. Georgetown entices students by telling them, “A university is many things but central to its being is discourse, discussion, debate: the untrammeled expression of ideas and information.” Georgetown adds that “Catholic and Jesuit tradition, far from limiting or compromising the ideal of free discourse, requires that we live up to that ideal.”
Georgetown is failing to do so. Just ask H*yas for Choice Vice President Erica Slates. She says that her group has about 100 active members with a mailing list of 1,000. They want to be allowed to be an official student organization and get that asterisk out of their name. Georgetown has been saying no.
According to Georgetown’s Vice President for Student Affairs Todd A. Olson, “As a Catholic and Jesuit university, our policies must reflect our identity and our values,” but H*yas for Choice promotes ideas “inconsistent with Roman Catholic moral tradition” and must remain off of the list.
At Georgetown, College Democrats is on the list. Students for Justice in Palestine is, too, and of course, so is Right to Life. Not H*yas for Choice.
What about the great Catholic and Jesuit moral tradition of permitting untrammeled expression, as Georgetown promised?
Besides, the Muslim Students Association and the Jewish Students Association are on the list. Someone should ask Olson how these groups — in both their expression and their conduct — square with the university’s Catholic and Jesuit identity.
According to Georgetown’s Director of Student Programs, Erika L. Cohen-Derr, “Our goals and yours are the same: to provide high quality programs that reflect Georgetown’s diverse community.” Nevertheless, H*yas for Choice is apparently too far beyond the pale to deserve any official university support. So much for reflecting the actual diversity of views at Georgetown.
Wouldn’t a great university want to give students even greater protection to “think the unthinkable, mention the unmentionable,” as Yale University promises, than even the First Amendment offers citizens at large? Why should a university restrict rather than expand the right to free speech?
 H*yas for Choice isn’t even asking for such a noble educational environment as that. It just wants equal treatment under Georgetown’s actual policies.
However you feel about abortion, if you think free speech principles and promises mean anything substantial, you should be protecting the equal rights of pro-life students at Arizona and pro-choice students at Georgetown. How can one group expect equal treatment if it refuses to advocate equal treatment for all, despite fundamental disagreements?
This is a good question for Georgetown and all citizens to take to heart.

2011-04-12,AU,Palestine,"A Student Government resolution recommending AU invest in U.S. companies that are based in or invest in Israel failed after contentious debate April 10.
Even after several revisions, the resolution failed with a vote of 10 senators for, 11 against and seven abstentions. 
Students who supported the resolution said it wasn’t political but rather made financial sense. They felt Israel was a good place to invest because of its strong economic performance during the recession and status as a world creditor, not debtor.
“This is not foreign policy. This is us using our investment money in businesses in Israel,” said College of Arts and Sciences Senator Amy Leazes, the resolution’s sponsor.  
But senators who opposed the resolution felt it was too political.
“It’s wrong for us as the student government body to support such a resolution,” said Class of 2012 Senator Roger Deming. “You can say all you want: ‘This [resolution] to me is just a business transaction.’ But I’m sorry, the Confederate flag is more than a flag.”
Students who are not in the SG voiced their opinions on the resolution during the meeting’s public comment period, before the debate on the legislation.
Former SG President Andy MacCracken, a senior in the School of Public Affairs, said he believes investing in U.S. companies that invest in Israel is a sound financial decision. 
“We [AU] have made poor financial decisions in the past. Looking forward, students need to be engaged in how we’re investing our dollars and looking at trends of where it’s most sensible to invest money,” MacCracken said. “Coming out of the financial recession that the world is just recovering from now, Israel is a nation that was least affected.”
Other students disagreed, saying that the economics and politics could not be separated on this issue and that AU support for Israel would be wrong because of Israel’s actions in Palestine.
“I am not interested in AU making financial or institutional profit. I am, on the other hand, very interested in ensuring that the investments that AU does make are in line with socially just and equal principles,” said School of International Service senior Sepideah Mohsenian. “By investing in innovation from Israel, AU is de facto supporting Israeli foreign policy.”
AU spokeswoman Maralee Csellar said AU’s finance office would need to research all funds to determine if the University invests in any companies that invest in Israel.
In 2006, AU’s Board of Trustees passed a resolution saying AU “will not invest directly in companies doing business in the oil and gas sector in Sudan.” The University also notified its investment managers to end any investments in companies doing business in the oil and gas sector.
This resolution is still in effect.

2011-10-11,AU,Palestine,"American University is well known for its inclusion and efforts to unify students from a bevy of diverse backgrounds. From athletics to political speakers to the Westboro Baptist Church Counter Demonstration, the AU community comes together to support our entire community. While we each have our own opinions, our campus renowned for our civility and ability to engage in an open dialogue. 
In this light, the students of American University Students for Israel (AUSFI) do not feel it is appropriate to engage in ATV’s upcoming special program focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The format of this program, asking student leaders their opinions, only creates the potential for a hostile environment. 
AUSFI is the umbrella student organization for Israel life on campus, focusing on educating students on the culture and politics of Israeli society. AUSFI embraces the same values as the AU community; we believe in allowing for an open dialogue in a safe and welcoming environment. Unfortunately, ATV’s proposed program does not provide a welcoming and educational environment in which to engage. We encourage students to remain the well-read and educated leaders for which we are constantly singled out. To outline our position in one simple line: We support direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, without preconditions, with final status compromises that result in peace for both parties living together in harmony.
Nothing productive would come of a debate between two student organizations with differing opinions. It is unfair to pit students against each other, especially about a subject many find so personal. At the end of the day, it is up to the leaders of their respective countries to come to a conclusion. What happens within the upcoming weeks regarding Israel and Palestine will certainly be matters of discussion, but not debate.

2011-12-07,AU,Palestine,"From sleeping on sidewalks to organizing vigils in McPherson Square, AU students in Occupy AU and other student groups are giving their continued support for the Occupy D.C. movement. Here are what each group is doing to support the Occupy movement.
Community Action and Social Justice Coalition
CASJ is leading AU student engagement in Occupy D.C. The coalition acts as an organizing collective for 14 campus clubs that coordinates independent events and directs interested students to clubs within the coalition, according to Mitch Ellmauer, a junior in the School of Public Affairs. 
CASJ started in the 1960s as an anti-war and anti-draft counseling center and is not funded by AU. CASJ clubs including Movement for Global Justice, Student Worker Alliance and Fair Trade Student Association have had student representation at Occupy D.C.
During the first two weeks of Occupy D.C., CASJ had 10 to 12 students and alumni actively participating together in the events, some of which stayed overnight in sleeping bags at the protests. 
“The point is to try to get people to see and know what’s going on in the city in terms of activism,” said Mary Donoghue, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences.
Participation has lately been on a more individual basis and has been less consistent.
“The thing about Occupy is that it’s trendy, so people will go once or twice then lose interest,” said Rachel Mandelbaum, a junior in the School of International Service.
CASJ will be focusing on student democracy next semester, which would include increased student input in University decision making that goes beyond student government. The coalition hopes to put an elected student with voting power on the Board of Trustees.
Students for Justice in Palestine
While many members of Student for Justice in Palestine have participated in the Occupy movement independently, the group helped organize a vigil Nov. 6 in McPherson Square for the victims of Operation Cast Lead, the 2008-2009 war in the Gaza Strip.
The vigil was not an official Occupy D.C. event, but many D.C. occupiers joined in, Steve Demarest, a junior in SPA, wrote in an email.
SJP also protested Israel’s use of Caterpillar bulldozers during Operation Cast Lead to destroy homes, factories, food and water systems, Demarest said. 
“There is a diverse group of political views within the Occupy movement, but I think the one common thread that unites protesters is opposition to corporate abuse, i.e., putting profit over people,” Demarest said.  
Eco-Sense
Eco-Sense has been advocating for sustainability and environment awareness in the Occupy D.C movement. Members volunteer and engage in political activism on environmental issues on campus and in D.C. A handful of Eco-Sense members were recently involved with the Occupy D.C. movement.
Mandelbaum; Megan Lyle, a sophomore in CAS; and other AU students attended the Anti-Tar Sands Keystone XL rally Nov 6. The rally was not directly a part of Occupy D.C., but many occupiers attended it, Lyle said. 
The protest focused on stopping the construction of the Tar Sands Keystone XL pipeline, which could potentially pollute major water supplies and transport tar sands oil that burn dirtier than other oils, according to Mandelbaum. 
The pipeline would stretch across thousands of miles from Canada, through the continental United States, to Texas to transport unrefined oil, Lyle said. 
American Vegan Outreach
American Vegan Outreach has not been directly involved with Occupy D.C., but numerous AU vegans have joined the Occupy D.C. movement, according to Paige McNamara, a sophomore in CAS. 
The Occupy D.C. Declaration directly mentions opposition to factory farms, a key AVO issue, McNamara said. 
McNamara held teach-ins about veganism at Occupy D.C., offering the platform for discussion on why veganism should be a viable option for all people.
“I hope to be able to introduce the idea of veganism as a tool of liberation, not just for animals but for workers, people, consumers to the people at McPherson,” she said. 
McNamara also said sustainable living practices are a major theme at the Occupy D.C. camp. McNamara said it is only natural that veganism will be the next major discussion at Occupy D.C.
Justice Not Jails
The prison reform advocacy group took part in a march from the McPherson Square to a Wells Fargo bank Dec. 2 to protest the bank’s investment in the GEO Group. Demarest said the GEO Group is a private prison company that cuts costs by assigning one doctor for every 1,300 prisoners at the Rivers Correctional Institute, where many D.C. residents are held.
He saw “a decent amount” of people at the protest.
“Once we got to Wells Fargo, many people spoke about their own thoughts and experiences with private prisons and the prison system in general,” Demarest said. 
College Democrats
College Democrats is one of the largest clubs at AU and has differing opinions when it comes to the Occupy D.C. movement, said Chris Litchfield, president of College Democrats and a junior in SPA and CAS. 
College Democrats agrees with Occupy D.C.’s major issues, but not with the methods the group has proposed for solutions, he said.
One of the major issues that College Democrats has focused on is wealth inequality. The Democratic Party is looking for a more equitable tax structure to help shrink the wealth divide between the 99 percent and the 1 percent, Litchfield said. 
“I think there is still a role to play when it comes to advocacy in government,” he said.
He also said he sees a lot of overlay between the future of the Democratic Party and Occupy participants.
“Occupy is not an arm of the Democratic Party, but moving forward, this will be a very defining time,” Litchfield said. “It is nice to see other people than the Democratic Party talking about these issues.”
On campus, College Democrats hosted a panel on debt negotiation Nov. 30 after the failure of Congress’ Super Committee and plans to host events in the near future focusing on student education of important issues facing the United States and AU.

2012-12-07,AU,Palestine,"A candlelight vigil was held on Dec. 4 by the pro-Israel group, J Street U, in memory of the Palestinian and Israeli victims of the recent conflict in Gaza. The event was held in front of the Kay Spiritual Life center. 
Candles were lit in honor of the victims while Ibraheem Samirah, vice president of AU Jewish Voice for Peace, read the names of victims. The list was eight pages long and included six Israeli names along with 107 Palestinian names, according to Damián Fontanez, a member of AU Students for Justice in Palestine.
The names were intentionally scrambled in order to keep focus on the individuals rather than the ethnicity, according to Bradley Harmon, president of J Street U at AU.  
“We are not here to mourn the loss on one side or another,” he said.
J Street U hosted the event after other chapters of the national organization held similar vigils, according to Harmon.
AU Students for Justice in Palestine, AU Jewish Voice for Peace and Christians United for Israel at AU co-hosted the vigil. 
Prayers from the Jewish, Muslim and Christian faiths were then read in honor of the dead.
“If we can’t come together on this, we can’t come together on anything,” Harmon said.
Students in attendance found inspiration in the prayer service, according to Elana Friedman, a junior in the School of International Service. 
“When I’m at school I don’t pray,” Friedman said, “so it’s nice to remember we can pray for things to get better.”

2014-12-11,AU,Palestine,"AU terminated its contract with the apparel company JanSport in October, after the company failed to sign an agreement that would hold its factories in Bangladesh to certain fire and building safety standards.
AU End Deathtraps advocated for AU to end all relationships with garment and apparel producers who had not signed on to The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh. The accord is an international and binding agreement to protect factory workers, according to Sean Reilly-Wood, a senior in the College of Arts and Sciences who is a member of Student Worker Alliance and part of the AU End Deathtraps coalition.
“We won our campaign,” Reilly-Wood said.
The University ended its licensing contracts with Paramount Apparel and Box Seat Clothing and suspended its partnership with JanSport in September, The Eagle previously reported. JanSport is a subsidiary of VF, which is a large corporation based in the United States that does some of its garment production in Bangladesh, Reilly-Wood said.
President Kerwin received recommendations to end AU’s contracts with corporations that had not signed the accord during the spring of 2014. The recommendation came from the University's Project Team on Social Responsibility, Business Practices and Service that was co-chaired by Linda Argo, who is the assistant vice president of external relations and auxiliary services.
The project team began the legal process of terminating its contract with JanSport on Oct. 9 because JanSport was not in compliance with the University's vendor code of conduct, Argo said by email. The process was complete by Oct. 29, according to Argo.
“I write to inform you that the legal process has concluded and our agent has terminated JanSport's license to produce AU-branded collegiate apparel,” Argo said in an Oct. 29 email to the coalition.
AU End Deathtraps is a branch of the national campaign United Students Against Deathtraps. AU’s branch is made up of a coalition of 12 student groups, including American Dream, Amnesty International, AU Gamers, Bhakti Vegetarian Yoga Club, Eco-Sense, French Club, Muslim Student Association, Queers and Allies, Student Worker Alliance, Students for Justice in Palestine, Students for Reproductive Justice and The United Methodist Student Association.
“Most students were supportive of the campaign,” Reilly-Wood said.
The group has been pressuring the University to end AU’s apparel licensing contracts with the three companies since Fall 2013. 
President Neil Kerwin released a memo to the AU community on April 21 that the University would end all contracts for AU apparel licensees with companies that did not sign the accord within the next 30 days, The Eagle previously reported.
“I received a recommendation of the Project Team on Social Responsibility, Business Practices and Service, to amend AU’s vendor code of conduct to address the concerns associated with the apparel industry in Bangladesh,” Kerwin said in the memo. “I have accepted their recommendation.”
Contract terminations with JanSport did not immediately take place after the 30 day window, because the University was still investigating its parent-company VF Corporation’s labor practices in Bangladesh, The Eagle previously reported.
AU End Deathtraps attempted to contact the administration after the announcement, but there was little communication between the administration and students, according to the press release. The coalition delivered a letter to President Kerwin on Sept. 5 concerning the lack of communication, The Eagle previously reported.
The year-long student action is seen as a victory for both students and Bangladeshi workers.
“This sort of campaign makes universities hold their contracts to the standards of the accord,” Reilly-Wood said.

2015-11-12,AU,Palestine,"*Updated: 5:09 p.m. Nov. 14. Corrections and clarification appended. 
The discovery of posters bearing Islamophobic messages on campus Sunday evening has raised concerns about the safety of Muslim students.
The posters mentioned chapters of the Muslim Students Association and Students for Justice in Palestine. One depicts deceased al-Qaeda member Anwar al-Awlaki with a target over his face. The picture on the poster is surrounded by the words, “MSA Terrorist: Head of al-Qaeda in Yemen, President MSA Colorado State” and the hashtag “#StopTheJihadOnCampus.” A 2010 New York Times article confirms that al-Awlaki attended Colorado State, and was the president of the MSA chapter there.
Another poster, which bears the same hashtag, shows a bloody knife hovering over a Jewish star under the words, “The real meaning of BDS: Boycott, Divest, Stab.” This phrase draws a reference to “Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions,” a strategy used by Students for Justice in Palestine chapters and other organizations to protest Israel’s political treatment of the Palestinian territories. 
Students found two posters in the tunnel next to Bender Arena and four more on lampposts between Kogod and Katzen.
Aman Abdelhamid, the president of AU’s MSA chapter, said she felt severely troubled by the posters. 
“We’ve been dealing with [Islamophobia] our entire lives, but to come to a school and to have fliers posted like that with threatening images…it’s just so upsetting,” Abdelhamid said.
The posters are linked to “Stop the Jihad on Campus,” a campaign funded by the California-based David Horowitz Freedom Center. A statement that the Office of Campus life e-mailed to the student body Tuesday afternoon connected the posters to the Freedom Center, and the group’s website claims the organization “combats the efforts of the radical left and its Islamist allies to destroy American values and disarm this country as it attempts to defend itself in a time of terror.” 
Horowitz’s materials have appeared on campuses across the country, according to Abdelhamid.
Members of the MSA and SJP found a 44-page manifesto on the website for the “Stop the Jihad on Campus” campaign. The document claims that MSA recruits for al-Qaeda and Hamas. None of this is true, according to Laith Shakir, treasurer of AU’s SJP chapter. Both organizations’ budgets are financed through AU Club Council, he said.
“Not only is all of the information presented here categorically false, it also propagates an exhausted talking point: if you are (or even just look) Muslim, and you're involved in campus organization, you must also be involved in a terrorist group,” Shakir wrote in a Facebook post Sunday night. “Thus, Muslims and people who ‘look Arab’ are inextricably linked to violent extremism. The promoted hashtag isn't trying to just ‘stop the jihad’ (which, itself, is a nonsensical phrase); instead, it's trying to eradicate anyone who could conceivably be labeled as Arab or Muslim from organizing on campus.”
Shakir was one of several students who shared pictures of the flyer on Facebook. Many urged their peers to report the incident to Public Safety. Some also offered to walk with Muslim students who did not feel safe traveling alone, Mokuena said. 
The posters have made Muslim students feel unsafe, according to Abdelhamid.
“I had people calling me [on Sunday], telling me that they were legitimately scared,” she said. “The posters…had really strong implications, really threatening messages.”
The discovery of the posters coincided with instances of Islamophobia on other campuses in the DMV area, Abdelhamid said. The same posters were recently spotted on the Georgetown and George Washington University campuses. At Virginia Tech, students found the message, “On 11/11, we will kill all the Muslims,” written on a bathroom stall, Abdelhamid said. 
The fact that the posters originated from an outside organization, Abdelhamid said, will not be comforting until the people who put them up are identified. 
“The thing is, we don’t know who posted these flyers,” she said. “It was definitely on behalf of that organization, but we don’t know if they sent people from the organization to come on campuses, or whether they recruited actual students.”
On Sunday night, SJP president Ntebo Mokuena brought one of the posters found in the tunnel to the Public Safety office, where she filed a written report. An officer escorted her to the tunnel to take down the other poster there and walked with her to MGC to look for more. She said she was told that officers would be available to escort any students across campus, and that they would search the campus for more posters.
Members of the MSA and SJP raised concerns about the posters in a meeting with representatives from the Kay Spiritual Life Center, Public Safety, Student Activities and the Office of Campus Life Monday afternoon. 
Although officers assured Mokuena and others Sunday night that they would find and remove as many posters as they could, Attai said she saw three posters on lampposts near Kogod, and one on the traffic box near Glover Gate, on Monday morning. Three Public Safety officers were standing near the one on the traffic box, she said, so she assumed it would be taken down. When she passed by the area three hours later, the officers were gone, and the poster was still there. She and a friend took it down themselves, despite fears of being targeted by the people who put them up. Attai said she removed the three on the lampposts as well.
AU Director of Public Relations Kelly Alexander said in an email that the officers did not remove the poster on the traffic box because it was “crazy glued” down, and the traffic box was city property. To avoid damaging the box, Alexander said, the officers requested that the city take the poster down.
Alexander said that a Public Safety officer removed additional posters on the quad near Kogod.
She said that between Sunday and Monday, any poster that Public Safety officers saw or were made aware of were taken down. Posters left up either went unreported or were put up after officers patrolled the area.
Public Safety did not issue an independent public statement or AU alert, despite requests from MSA and SJP members. The University did release a statement on Facebook and Twitter shortly after the posters were discovered.
""AU Public Safety has been doing a really good job reaching out to us and being proactive in terms of dealing with this whole issue. The head of PS has now met with us for the second time to ensure and work with us that our safety and well-being is secure,"" Attai said.
However, both SJP and MSA members said they were concerned by the University’s lack of protocol for dealing with hate speech.
“The University had good intentions, but they said a lot of what is going to be done is going to happen through the community,” Abdelhamid said. “And I understand that … community involvement and awareness is a huge part of the whole situation, but the administration needs to do their part. We need to know that the University knows how to deal with these kinds of threats.”
Shakir said he was also troubled by the University’s response.
“As students and members of a marginalized community, we didn’t know where to go after being specifically targeted with violent messages,” he said. “Part of our hope is that this will serve as a case study for the University going forward, to have a protocol in place to allow students to know how the University will respond to hate crimes before that happens, and to serve as a sort of preventative measure.”
Gail Hanson, the vice president of Campus Life, said AU does not have a hate speech policy. There is a set of Freedom of Expression Guidelines, which she said outlines the cases in which the University can intervene in student speech. 
“Protest or demonstration shall not be discouraged so long as neither force nor the threat of force is used, and so long as the orderly processes of the University are not deliberately obstructed,” the policy states. 
Prohibited “expressions of dissent” include those that “deny or infringe upon the rights of other students, faculty, staff, or guests of the University community…disrupt or interfere with educational or other activities of the University community…[or] endanger the safety of any person on the University campus.”
The guidelines do not apply to people from outside the AU community, Hanson said. In accordance with University policy, only students, staff and faculty are allowed to place posters on campus. The organizations or individuals responsible for the content must make their names visible on all posted materials. Posters put up by outsiders will be removed, Hanson said. 
Shakir said the posters are “emblematic of a much larger mentality” of animosity toward SJP chapters and Islamophobia.
This is not the first time AU’s SJP chapter has encountered hostility, according to Mokuena. She said that the group’s posters are frequently defaced or ripped down.
The MSA, SJP, the University and AU Hillel have issued statements condemning the posters. 
“I am profoundly upset and displeased at the inflammatory posters that went up over the weekend,” University Chaplain Joe Eldridge said in an interview. “It is incumbent on us as an American University community to surround our Muslim brothers and sisters with compassion.”

Campus police were referred to in some statements made by the University shortly after.

2020-11-13,AU,Palestine,"Palestinian social justice event flyer. 
An Arab and Muslim studies professor from San Francisco State University joined American University students for a virtual event on Oct. 29 entitled “The Palestinian Exception to Calls for Social Justice.” 
Rabab Abdulhadi discussed calls for Palestinian human rights in the United States. AU professors Irene Calis and Zein El-Amine co-hosted the event, which Calis referred to as a call for justice.
“It is about the real material consequences of working towards the emancipation of Palestinian life, land and dignity,” Calis said.
Abdulhadi said that people should recognize that criticism of Israel is not the same as anti-Semitism. 
“Israel should not get exceptional treatment because Israel is not exceptional. Palestine is not exceptional,” Abdulhadi said. “The U.S. is not exceptional, and we argue against exceptionalism. This is a question of justice.”
Abdulhadi also discussed her experience fighting against censorship in her line of work and activism. 
The conversation was co-sponsored by various student groups, including but not limited to Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), African Students’ Organization and AU Pride. The Department of Sociology and the Department of Critical Race, Gender, and Culture Studies served as academic sponsors of the event. 
Junior Kiran Waqar, a member of SJP, said that the number of co-sponsors was significant in representing the interconnected concern for justice in Palestine, which many students at AU feel passionate about. 
“It can be difficult for a lot of people on American University's campus when they feel like their values aren’t seen in a lot of places,” Waqar said. “I think a really big part of [the event] is community building and showing people that they can speak up for what they believe is right and that they have other people supporting them.”
Junior Aqsa Rashid, also a member of SJP, said another goal of the event was to paint Palestine in a light that students don’t often see at AU, one devoid of the logistics of policy that might constrain conversation and debate. 
“We're not approaching it from that lens,” Rashid said. “We're approaching it like how we can come together as a community that cares about people and justice.” 
Abdulhadi also spoke about how to keep going when activism work becomes frustrating or hopeless. Abdulhadi advised thinking of this work as a “labor of love.”
“Think of what we're doing as coming together to enrich and support each other,” Abdulhadi said. “Of course, it's exhausting to do all of this stuff, day in and day out. But what option do we have? What choice do we have?”
In reflecting on the event, Waqar found Abdulhadi’s words to be a revitalizing path to justice. 
“It's hard to have energy after a long day and on a Team call, but I did,” Waqar said, referring to Microsoft Teams. “I had energy because there was hope, and that hope is a return to self. This was one of the most effective, genuine events I've been to on campus. It felt like I could finally breathe; I didn't realize how much I was holding on my chest.”

2022-02-11,AU,Palestine,"Tzipi Livni, the former Vice Premier, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice for Israel, spoke to American University students in a webinar co-sponsored by the School of Public Affairs and the Center for Israel Studies on Feb. 7.
Livni was the featured speaker at this year’s Amos Perlmutter Memorial Lecture, an annual event held to commemorate Perlmutter, a late scholar of Middle East political leadership and SPA professor.
According to the Center for Israel Studies, Livni is “known for her efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was Israel’s chief negotiator for peace between Israel and the Palestinians during the last two rounds of negotiations.”
The question and answer portion of the webinar was moderated by Saul Newman, the associate dean for Undergraduate Education in the Department of Government at AU.
During the webinar, Livni said she decided to leave politics three years ago after feeling she did not have enough political power to promote continued peace talks between Israel and Palestine.
“This is the right policy for the future of both my sons, but also their generation,” Livni said. “I hope that the time will come and we will see this happening, because the other option, I believe, is not the Zionist option.”
Livni also discussed the “huge gap” between the state of Israel and its perception by the international community.
“For many years, the outside world is looking at Israel through the lenses of the [Palestinian and Israeli] conflict, [and the] sometimes distorted lenses of the conflict,” Livni said. “It also affects the situation in Israel. The nature of democracy, the policy of some Israeli governments affects the relations between Israel and the world. And I believe that we need to open a new dialogue.”
Prior to the event, AU Students for Justice in Palestine released a statement condemning the lecture and Livni’s involvement. As of Feb. 10, the statement has been co-signed by 12 AU student organizations, such as AU Pride, the South Asian Student Association and the Arab Student Association.
According to the AUSJP statement, when Livni was a “key” member of former Isreali Prime Minister Ehud Olmert’s cabinet, they led a 2008 assault on the Gaza Strip called Operation Cast Lead. The operation led to the deaths of 1400 Palestinians, including 300 children. 
“We call on the university to cancel this lecture and to reckon with its unapologetic support of this settler-colonial and apartheid state, including the disproportionate amount of resources it contributed to an Israeli-centric, and anti-Palestinian, education,” the statement said. “Students for Justice in Palestine will continue to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people until such demands are met and the liberation for all Palestinians is realized.”
AUSJP did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Eagle.
When asked where she draws the line between disagreement with Israeli policy and antisemitism, Livni said that while critizing the Israeli government is legitimate, not accepting the right of Israel to exist is “something completely different.”
“I think that the base is understanding that the Jewish people [have] the rights, historical tradition and international rights to establish and to live in the nation-state of the Jewish people,” Livni said.

2022-11-10,AU,Palestine,"Palestinian writer and spoken word poet Ghadeer Malek shared her work in an online event hosted by American University’s Arab World Studies and Georgetown University's Center for Contemporary Arab Studies on Nov. 1.  
During the discussion moderated by AU Director of Arab World Studies Irene Calis, Malek talked about tackling subjects like displacement, feminism and settler-colonialism as a Palestinian woman. The talk also included poets Shano Mohammed, a Georgetown student in the Master of Arts in Arab Studies program, and AU student Satreen Hendi.  
The event is the second installment of the online speaker series, “Palestine: Land, Life, Dignity,” a collaborative initiative aimed at centering anti-colonial struggles and protecting similar stories from erasure. Malek said portraying this reality and relating it to a larger picture is the basis of her work.  
“What drove me to poetry was the need to express ourselves as Palestinians in particular,” Malek said at the event. “I always joke around with my friends that Palestinians are gaslit from the moment they’re born in the sense that … we’re born into a reality in which [our experience of colonialism] is completely erased.”  
Malek added that poetry, specifically spoken word, has become a vehicle for expressing her anger and resilience at the damage colonialism has inflicted on Palestinian and other Indigenous communities.  
“A lot of my voice at the beginning came out as rants because I was angry as a young Palestinian; angry at the world, angry at colonization,” she said. “I wanted my voice to be heard … and that sort of anger was channeled into spoken word.”  
Born in Palestine, Malek immigrated to Canada in 2003 to study at the University of Toronto, where she became active in student movements supporting Palestinian causes. Her body of work includes the poems “I Exist,” “Revolution to My Earth” and the anthology book “Min Fami: Arab Feminist Reflections of Identity, Space & Resistance,” a collection of writing from multiple authors. Malek said having multiple voices was an integral part of the book.  
“The more voices that come to the table the better they are,” she said, adding that gathering writers from various religious and cultural backgrounds helped her form a community. “That’s why I’m very proud of ‘Min Fami’ … I don’t feel like I’m a single voice talking on my own.”  
In an example of gathering different voices, Mohammed and Hendi both shared poems about overcoming cultural and institutional barriers. Mohammed, who was born in Iraqi Kurdistan, recited her poem about the limitations placed on women in the Middle, East and Sateen delivered a poem centered around the death of Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian journalist killed by Israeli police in May.  
“This is one of my process pieces where I start with an idea or a phrase or something and see where it takes me,” Hendi said. “I talk about the frustration of what it feels like to have to deal with the trauma and the pain of experiencing that situation in real time while also trying to convince people to care about it.”  
While spreading awareness about difficult topics is a central part of her work, Malek said she still grapples with self-doubt about her identity and qualifications as a writer.  
“It’s always a lot of questions and a lot of hesitations in the sense that there’s always a voice underneath our voice … there’s always another voice there questioning,” she said. “I like to call that voice the doubtful voice, the colonizer’s voice, the oppressor’s voice telling us that we’re not good enough.”  
Malek said she combats these feelings by reminding herself, and other Palestinian activists, that her lived experience is more powerful than her doubts. 
“Follow that voice of what you know, because when you write about what you know, the hesitations will still be there … but you can override that voice because you know something that voice doesn’t know, which is that you’re Palestinian,” she said. “Always acknowledge that that voice will come, but you have an inherent knowledge that you can tap into.”

2009-03-05,AU,India,"On Feb. 26, AU Abroad sent an e-mail to students to unveil its two newest programs - both of which are in India. Students now have the opportunity to study at Fergusson College in Pune or at Manipal University in Manipal. 
With more than 1,500 different recognized dialects and 24 official languages, India is the most multicultural country in the world - a fact many foreigners may find daunting, according to Ethan Merritt, an AU Abroad adviser. 
""I have never been more overwhelmed in travels abroad than when I spent time in Delhi,"" he said. ""Thousands of people are all around you, all speaking different languages and going different places.""
But after recently returning from India, Merritt and AU Abroad Director Sara Dumont said they found this high-scale diversity to be the most beautiful part of the country.
""What you get in India is a sense of what diversity really means,"" Dumont said. ""You could travel 50 miles in any direction and be in a totally different culture than where before. That's what makes it so important for Americans to be able to study there.""
Pune's Fergusson College is east of Mumbai, according to Merritt. Pune is small city compared to Mumbai, but it is known for its reputation as a young, vibrant cultural hub, housing multiple universities and India's National Film Archives and Institute.
Pune is not considered a tourist destination, according to Merritt. The Alliance for Global Education runs Fergusson's program. The Alliance is trying to limit the amount of students involved to 20, according to Dumont. Abroad students at Fergusson will live in homestays with a family, and have the option to be as involved with the family as they would like.
The second abroad program in India is held at Manipal University - one of the country's top five universities, Dumont said.
The world-renowned university is very international, and boasts degree-seeking students from more than 50 different countries. While Manipal is known for its medical and engineering curriculums, the university's Cultural Studies, Communications and International Politics departments run the study abroad program - a perfect fit for AU students, Merritt said. Manipal has a tropical climate, and is miles away from the beach. Its campus has a thriving community feel where all students and most faculty live on campus.
The two new India programs fill a void in AU Abroad, Dumont said.

2009-08-13,AU,India,"September doesn't just mean the start of classes and schoolwork; it is also the start of an active AU fall sports lineup. 
Often, when someone thinks about AU sports, the basketball team is the only thing that comes to mind. While they have been successful in the last few years, the AU field hockey, volleyball and soccer teams have also succeed in their respective sports. The fall season holds several NCAA tournaments and Patriot League Championships just like in the springtime.
Of the fall teams, the women's volleyball team has been the most successful. The Eagles coach Barry Goldberg has accumulated a record of 296-187 over 19 seasons with the school. His success has not come in just a few unbelievable seasons, and his consistency has shown on the court, as the Eagles have been selected as Patriot League preseason number one for the eighth year in a row.
Along with their strong coaching staff the team returns most of their members, only losing four members to graduation. To go along with their veteran squad, the Lady Eagles also have the world's tallest female twins returning in front of the net. They have been an important part to AU's success in the last few years and look to continue their dominance again this year.
The volleyball team opens their season Aug. 28 at George Mason University, and their home opener will be on Aug. 29 against George Washington.
AU's field hockey team has also put together a stretch of winning seasons and has created a winning atmosphere. The ladies will begin their season Aug. 28 against Indiana in search of their seventh consecutive Patriot League Title. Five-time Patriot League Coach of the Year Steve Jennings 12 will be returning behind the bench for American.
The team's success has not come without recognition as they are ranked in the national top 20 in both the coaches' and RPI polls for the sixth consecutive year. With the Lady Eagles only losing three to graduation, they look to continue that dominance.
Among the players returning are Patriot League Rookie of the Year Tatum Dyer, Third Team All-American Christine Fingerhuth and All-Mid Atlantic Region and Patriot League Second Team selection Kristin Gebhart. All of these players, including several other national selections, will be attempting to continue Jennings' smash mouth defensive minded hockey. 
It is clear that the ever-evolving talent pool paired with Jennings' coaching style has been fruitful, as the team rides a 43-game conference win streak. They have struggled recently against non-conference opponents however, and will have to make it through their first nine games before seeing a League opponent. They open up their conference schedule on Oct. 3 at Holy Cross.
The final two sports of the fall season are men's and women's soccer. Both teams have struggled in recent past but look to improve off of last year.  The men's team finished the year in the Patriot League semi-finals with a final record of 9-7-3 overall. The women didn't have quite the same success posting a 5-10-4 record, but have certainly made progress towards winning.
Perhaps the most important thing for the men to concentrate on is continuing their success at home and in the conference. They had a record of 5-2-1 at home and a 5-1-1 record against conference opponents; winning these games are how teams become champions. The Eagles were successful in overtime, winning several nail-biters in extra time. These wins are crucial since they often boost morale and give a team confidence.
The AU fall sports line is packed with great games. AU Athletics has something for everyone. Not only can everyone enjoy good matches, but they also can be part of a winning culture. While not all teams are on top of their respective Leagues, they are certainly moving in the right direction.

• RE: the evolution rant last time:
New rule.  If you don't believe in evolution, you become a monkey again.  Any takers?
• I really don't understand the complaints about the housing plans for next year. Many people are complaining about their inability to finance off campus housing. I know the economy is bad now. However, some blame also rests with students. Students at AU attend a school that costs around 47k a year. If you really can't afford 47k a year or are unwilling to take out a loan (or two), then you are much better suited to attending a public in state college. If you already have tons of loans and still can't afford AU then this school isn't for you. Save your money and your sanity by attending a college within your financial means. Otherwise you are following the same irresponsible financial spending pattern that led to the recession in the first place.
• I normally can't stand Alex Knepper, but the radical postmodern Marxist queer Chicano feminists of color comment on last week's Eagle Rants made me lol
• Why is it that ugly people always have the most obnoxious sex? It’s 2 a.m. and I can hear my neighbors bed shaking, her moaning, and him asking what about me.  Really guys? is the necessary?  I’m gonna go with no.  So much for living on the quiet side.
• Person on L7 making loud, obnoxious, angry sexual threats when playing Mario Kart...that is NOT ATTRACTIVE. I doubt any drunk man or lesbian would want to hook up with you making that much noise. So please...do us all a favor and SHUT THE FUCK UP!
• Snowstorm + no channels except for ATV=the Shining

• I am being kicked off campus next year despite the fact that I will be a senior and pay 100 percent full tuition for everything.  WTF.  Housing and Dining did not inform me of this until a few months ago.  Fuck housing and dining.

SCREW YOU HOUSING AND DINING!

You don't seem trashy or slutty and you don't wear disgusting amounts of make-up or jewelry.  Congratulations on joining greek like and not becoming a stereotype.  If only there were more like you.  You are probably the nicest girl I have met at AU.

• Whenever I bring up marriage to my boyfriend of one year, he never says anything.  (It's not like I want to get married anytime soon, not until I'm at least 28.) I always try to bring up our future together, but he never wants to talk about it.  Does this mean that he doesn't see a future with me and he just doesn't want to tell me that so that he can continue to get sex?  Why else would he always avoid talking about marriage?
-worried girlfriend
• Is it cheating to flirt with other guys on Facebook chat and not tell my boyfriend?  It's not like I do anything with them.  Most of them don't even live in the same city.  What do guys think about that?
• Is there a club on campus for pregnant girls?
• I am a female and I do not understand what all the feminists are complaining about.  Women have the choice in their lives to go work, stay home with their kids, or do some of both.  Men don't have that choice.  Men are severely socially stigmatized if they decide to stay home with their kids while the wife works.  Men do not have the options women do.  So why are females the ones complaining?  If I were a man, I would be pissed off at the injustice.
• If I have sex with a girl, my boyfriend doesn't need to know, right?
• How dumb do you have to be to suspend Nick Hendra? Jeff Jones you need to reinstate him, now!
• Nick Hendra is like Michael Jordan. Without him our eagles are an endangered species.
• Yo, Jeff Jones, I'll let you finish in a few, but that's got to be the biggest boneheaded decision of all time.
Is Jeff Jones getting paid off by other schools to bench our best players? If not why did he bench Hendra? Putz.
• Dear Charlie:
Can you fix something about the headlines ""Mets Among Losers in MLB Offseason"" Mets is synonymous with losers. It's like calling someone Fat Obese, or Skinny Thin.
EDITOR’S NOTE: As a Met fan I agree completely. 
• The fact that I have been subjected to ATV for the entire weekend has been PURE TORTURE. PUREEEEEEEEEEEEEEE TORTUREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I WANT TO GOUGE MY EYES OUT
• ATV being the only channel available during snowpocolypse has led me to my downfall...goodbye cruel world!

""Iceberg alert, full speed ahead""- Captain Smith

2010-02-11,AU,India,"The Democrats officially ceded the seat of their fallen hero — a seat they had held since the late Ted Kennedy’s brother occupied the White House — when Vice President Biden administered the oath of office to Republican Scott Brown last week. Brown’s arrival in Washington sounds the death knell for the dreamlike demands of President Barack Obama’s liberal base. Gone are the days of health care optimism and cap and trade consensus. Silence reigns where there were once cries for a second stimulus and righteous calls for a New York City civilian trial for Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. 
At least Obama had fair warning. Fragmentation of Democratic majorities began last November in New Jersey and Virginia. At the time, I described the gubernatorial victories of Republicans Chris Christie and Bob McDonnell as needed boosts for a desperate Republican Party, not direct repudiations of Obama’s policies. For the GOP to continue such success, it would have to court Independents and field “the right candidate … trumpeting a tailored message.” Three months later, despite doomsday predictions of the Tea Party's rise, Republicans have utilized this game plan to perfection. The American public has indeed rejected the Democratic mantra of more: more spending, more debt and more centralization of power in Washington. Judging by history, however, Obama should be quietly cheering his party’s fall from grace this coming November. Yes, you heard me correctly — root for the Republicans, Mr. President. 
As a man who grounded his 2008 campaign in centrist rhetoric, Obama has been willing to punt the liberal agenda to Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Capitol Hill. On top of the criticism that boxes him in from his left and right, the president has watched the center slip from his fingers. Therefore, Obama cannot tie his legacy to Democrats in Congress if he has any hope of turning his fortunes. In fact, working with a resurgent opposition party after 2010 would insulate the president from warring factions in search of his head. Then-candidate Obama enraged many Democrats when he claimed that Ronald Reagan had altered the trajectory of the political landscape in a way Bill Clinton had not. He did not mention that, as Jonathan Rauch of the National Journal reminds us, both Reagan and Clinton, the most popular and successful recent chief executives, shared power for significant portions of their terms. Detractors to the divided government theory may argue that George W. Bush benefited from Republican majorities in Congress throughout most of his presidency. How did that go for him in the end?
Data derived from the American Presidency Project demonstrates the counterintuitive notion that a Congress run by the rival party need not cripple a sitting president. The combined concurrence percentage of combined House and Senate votes to the expressed wishes of President Eisenhower (an underrated president) was roughly 70 percent. This statistic is relatively high until you consider that less successful presidents like Jimmy Carter (77 percent) and G. W. Bush (81 percent) witnessed better levels of concurrence. Reagan left office with a 62 percent concurrence mark and a 63 percent approval rating. Clinton’s Congress voted for his policy proposals only 57 percent of the time, but he exited the White House with support from two-thirds of the nation.  
Christie, McDonnell and Brown are just the first wave. Voters are frustrated with the priorities of Democrats in Washington. The economy is slowly recovering, but it will be a long march out of the woods. Republicans are priming viable, jobs-focused candidates in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. Shift to the center and Obama could enjoy a Clintonesque revival after the midterm elections. Embrace arrogance and partisanship, and Obama’s legacy will follow the path blazed by Carter and Bush.

Sufjan Stevens — The Age of Adz
(Asthmatic Kitty)
Sufjan Stevens, a ‘prophet’ of modern folk, has suddenly embraced drum machines, synths, and…auto tune? “The Age of Adz” (pronounced “Odds”) is a mix of wild electronica and epic orchestration. It’s whirling, disjointed and rambling, but grotesquely lovely. Stevens has stripped away the pretentious lengthy song titles, stories, settings and grand biographies in favor of first-person non-fiction. 
Lyrically, “Adz” is closest to his album “Seven Swans” — straightforward, honest, and immediate. Themes of depression, religious-zeal, death, and love run throughout. “Sufjan/the panic inside/the murdering ghost/that you cannot ignore,” he sings to himself on “Vesuvias” with full choir, woodwinds, and spiraling synths. He sings with reckless abandon on “I Want to Be Well” with lyrics like “Did I go at it wrong?/Did I go intentionally to destroy me?”

Small Black — New Chain
(Jagjaguwar)
Nostalgic vintage synths, samples and loops? Distorted, fuzzy vocals about wishing you could stay wherever you are or go back to wherever you were last summer? Piano melodies that could have been on a Lionel Ritchie album? Simple, 4/4 drum machine beats? Super short running time? A check to all of these! 
Small Black has made great chill-out music for your chillwave party. Whether or not you should choose to ride that wave is your own business, but bringing you back to a simpler time is Small Black’s business. The recommendations for this may as well say “the concept of chillwave.”

Brian Eno with Jon Hopkins & Leo Abrahams – Small Craft on a Milk Sea
(Warp)
Brian Eno’s newest album is split pretty evenly between ambient music (which he invented) and dark, synthesizer and drum machine-driven music (which he perfected). Though he’s spent the last few decades producing middle of the road U2 and James albums, Eno has retained his experimental sensibilities — these songs have movements in the sense that dramatic tone shifts pop up every once in a while and they have structure in the sense that they all have beginnings and ends. 
There’s an anger to the non-ambient tracks that Eno doesn’t usually express. Everything is faster and more crowded than the work he’s produced in the past, but when the harder-edged songs end, the gorgeous ambient tracks are there to clean the slate.

The Extra Lens — Undercard
(Merge)
“I hate this town, and there’s a whole long list of things that I hate. I had to starve myself all week to make way. Cleveland Ohio, 1985.” Does it get any more John Darnielle than that? The singular force behind The Mountain Goats has been writing songs like “Cruiserweights” for eons, elegizing small town failure and toil the way Belle & Sebastian do with shyness and photography. That’s not to say “Undercard” is a rehash of Goats’ material, as Darnielle takes us into more pop-y territory with a less sparse sound and some quality harmonies with frequent collaborator Franklin Bruno. But the straight-up acoustic sound, diary-esque lyrics, and Darnielle’s iconic “heart on sleeve” delivery puts this album firmly into his stylistic canon. And for the countless, rabid Mountain Goats fans out there, that’s really not a bad thing.

Bad Books — Bad Book
(Favorite Gentlemen)
Bad Book’s self-titled debut album does not disappoint. As a side project of Kevin Devine and Manchester Orchestra’s Andy Hull, this album melds the two groups’ styles perfectly by seamlessly combining the soft folk sound of Kevin Devine with the darker sound of Manchester Orchestra. But never fear, Bad Books isn’t simply a regurgitation of the two artists’ previous work; this album has a distinct sound. It is dark yet delicate, and the vocal combination of Devine’s adolescent-esque voice combined with the strained and rough voice of Hull creates a very interesting medley.

2011-04-12,AU,India,"The title of “Happythankyoumoreplease” is quite apropos — you will leave the theater grateful and wanting more of its offbeat charm. If you are already groaning at the prospect of yet another contrived indie rom-com à la “500 Days Of Summer” or the movie version of “Friends” or the millennials’ answer to “Singles,” you will find yourself pleasantly surprised.
In “Happythankyoumoreplease,” director, writer and star Josh Radnor (“How I Met Your Mother”) forgoes the hipper-and-more-clever-than-thou approach in favor of an unassuming, natural dialogue and genuinely likable characters. And if there is such a thing as a New York “vibe,” the movie captures it spot-on.  
The lead character, Sam (Radnor), is an aspiring novelist on the way to a meeting with a publisher who meets a boy named Rasheen (Michael Algieri) who gets separated from his family on the train. As a plot vehicle, Rasheen and Sam’s relationship is meant to assure us of Sam’s inherent goodness despite his ne’er-do-well, seemingly rakish lifestyle, delivering some of the more heart-warming, cute lines in the movie. 
For example, Sam labels his suburban angst-free childhood as hardly “Dickensian” or conducive to writing the great American novel. Or when Sam discovers Rasheen’s art talents, he laughs at Rasheen’s drawing of him as a “dashing Russian aristocrat.” These sort of exchanges abound and make the movie terribly endearing with a low cheese factor.
The other characters are equally compelling. Mary Catherine (Zoe Kazan) and her boyfriend Charlie (Pablo Schreiber), who try to decide whether or not to move to Los Angeles, which Mary calls the “epicenter of all that is awful.” Sam’s best friend Annie (Malin Akerman) is bemoaning her unfortunate choice in men, (dating “29-year-old 12-year-olds”) when she meets a seemingly dorky co-worker who seems to constantly hang out on her floor at work because “philanthropic giving is the cool place to be.”
Annie tells this story of an Indian cab driver-would-be-guru who advises her that a good way to perpetuate more gratitude in the universe is to simply say, “Thank you. More please.” Albeit hokey as far as mantras go, it’s veritable enough for hippie-esque Annie, who in the end gets over her abysmal dating streak and allows herself to be wooed by the uncool Sam #2.
Then, there is Sam’s love interest, waitress and cabaret singer Mississippi (Kate Mara), whose refusal to sleep with Sam due to her New Year’s avowal to “not be a whore” leads to their impossibly-cute three-day-stand/move-in session, complete with a hand-written contract and key exchange.
The characters in “Happythankyoumoreplease” feel very realistic with no tacked-on, contrived idiosyncrasies for entertainment’s sake. It’s definitely a feel-good movie, but not in a mawkish, fake sense. In the end, the characters all end up working through their various conflicts, but the resolutions are not fanciful and unrealistic.

That's sad. Try to care. Apathy is the worst thing that a person can feel in this world, worse than hate and worse than grief because there is no way to channel apathy. Don't mistake emotional exhaustion for not caring. Take a time out if you need to but don't leave the game.

2013-04-11,AU,India,"The usually quiet AU Quad was enveloped in a cloud of bright colors on April 7, as dozens of students gathered to celebrate Holi, the Indian Festival of Color. 
Holi celebrates the coming of spring in India and is traditionally celebrated by throwing powder and water at those who attend the festivities. 
Those who were prepared wore white, and those who weren’t watched as their clothes were destroyed by pink, yellow and red powdered paint provided by the South Asian Student Association, which hosted this event. 
Holi was also co-sponsored by Student Government, AU Muslim Student Association, AU Bhangra, the Center for Diversity and Inclusion and the Residence Hall Association.
The event started at 2 p.m., with groups of soon-to-be-painted students hesitantly approaching the area outside of Kay. 
After paint packets were distributed, the Quad became a swarm of bright colors, with attendees throwing powder at friends and strangers alike. Holi was open not just to AU students, but all members of the community.
“The most impressive thing to me was the diversity of the people there,” SIS junior Alison Pease said. “By that I mean there were not just AU students there, but also families and other people from the community. I think it’s great that AU takes the opportunity to celebrate such a fun holiday and that the community chooses to participate as well.” 
Local DJ Naiem Reza played popular songs throughout the event from both the US and India. Those who were versed in Bollywood dance styles had a chance to shine in the center of one of the various dance circles that had formed. Everyone else was able to come together for some paint-covered group dances like “The Cupid Shuffle” and “Gangnam Style.”
Soon after, another component was added: water. Buckets were filled and combined with paint to make colored water that was then dumped on people’s heads or shot through one of the water guns provided by SASA. 
The paint-stained, now wet Quad lent the perfect environment for a mud-sliding competition that cleared what was once the dance floor. 
“Being Hindu, I’ve never had so much fun celebrating Holi,” CAS freshman Sarthak Batra said. “From the beautiful color to the thick mud, it was more than an experience, and I look forward to doing it next year, even though the aftermath of cleaning up was difficult.”
Batra also said that this event sparked his interest in joining SASA, which also catered free samosas, an Indian fried pastry, for the event. 
After the celebration, the Quad was left stained bright red, resembling some sort of eerie abandoned battlefield after combat. 
However, the only casualties in the event of the Holi festival were some white t-shirts and a few pairs of jeans.

2013-04-11,AU,India,"This profile on AU men’s basketball Head Coach Jeff Jones was originally published in full on Schad's blog in October. 
In March 1993, a reporter asked then-Virginia head coach Jeff Jones where he saw himself in 20 years. The round-faced coach took a bite of his barbeque sandwich and answered.
“I won’t be coaching 20 years from now,” Jones, then 33, told The Roanoke Times. “There’s just too much excess baggage to go with the job.”
That, of course, was before he took Virginia to the Elite Eight in 1995. Before the son of a coach surpassed his father in wins. Before he remarried and moved to Washington D.C. Before he led American University to a pair of Patriot League titles and NCAA Tournament appearances.
Now 52, Jones smiles at the thought of his 33-year-old self. He sits quietly at his desk writing a thank you card, sporting a black Nike pullover and a light stubble. Commemorative basketballs and pictures of his children dot the office. A Big Gulp on his desk has been reduced to ice.
It is here, nestled in a corner office overlooking Bender Arena, that the fiery skipper, the man who routinely screams at his bench and is hoarse by game’s end, is at his most serene.
“Some people would say ‘well, it’s just basketball,’” Jones said, explaining his job. “It is, but when there’s that many people that pay that much attention, it is your livelihood. And there’s a lot of stress involved.”
The Washington D.C. region has seen its fair share of collegiate coaches come and go over the last dozen years, from a fired Karl Hobbs to the retired Gary Williams. But before Wednesday, only Jones, who first arrived at American in 2000, had survived.
He did it by winning in a winnable conference, building a rock-solid program that has never finished below fourth in the league. Graduation rates on the team were high. Support from the athletic department had never been better. Jones was comfortable, and one year ago his contract was extended through the 2016 season.
“We love DC, and there’s a loyalty,” Jones said in October. “American has been very welcoming, and for me that’s a big thing: to be at a place where you’re appreciated. There have been other opportunities, but this is and continues to be the right place for me.”
The Daily Press reported Wednesday that Jones has accepted the head coaching job at Old Dominion University. The move will be announced at a Thursday press conference, according to Press columnist David Teel.
———-
Jeffrey Allen Jones was a strange kid.
His father, Bobby Jones, coached the Kentucky Wesleyan Panthers for 13 years, first as an assistant and then as head coach. Born in Owensboro, Ky. in 1960, Jeff was five when his father started coaching, and he immediately fell in love with the game of basketball. He loved watching his dad’s practices, soaking up the intricacies of the game for hours on end. While his friends were outside, running around or maybe playing basketball themselves, little Jeff was sitting quietly in the gym, observing the Panthers’ practice.
“I remember people joking around that I was a strange kid because I would go and watch his practices, and I would literally watch,” Jones said. “I’d go and I’d sit there and I’d watch, and that was a great day for me.”
Jeff didn’t love coaching, but he loved basketball. Surrounded by the sport, he took to the court and quickly became one of the best point guard prospects in the state of Kentucky. Hours of watching practices had taught him how to see what other players might miss. It made him invaluable.
After high school, Jones opted to leave his home state for Charlottesville, Va., where he was a four-year starter for the Virginia Cavaliers. He’s most well-known for playing alongside Ralph Sampson and leading the team to four postseason appearances, including the 1980 NIT championship and the 1981 Final Four.
When he graduated with a psychology degree in 1982, he had five job offers waiting for him. The world was his oyster. But none of those offers fulfilled his lifelong dream of going to the NBA, so he waited. After being signed and cut by two teams in a matter of months, his NBA dreams were dashed by Christmas. He was looking at two options: play professionally overseas, or return to Virginia as an assistant coach.
“Playing in the NBA was a dream. Playing overseas wasn’t a dream,” Jones said. “When that NBA dream kind of ended, I was ready to turn the page. And that’s when coaching became something that I wanted to do.”
———-
As a 22-year-old assistant coach at Virginia, Jones was given a lot of freedom and input in head coach Terry Holland’s system. The staff would hash and rehash and re-rehash a plan ten times before finalizing it, and Jones’ opinion was valued every step of the way.
He learned by observation and worked his way up the coaching totem pole at Virginia until Holland left to become the athletic director at his alma mater, Davidson College. In a controversial move, the athletic department picked Jones, who was 29 at the time, to be his replacement. He became the youngest head coach in Atlantic Coast Conference history.
“I don’t think there was any question that I was ready,” Jones said. “Maybe unknowingly, I had been preparing most of my life for that.”
Seven years, six 20-win seasons and five NCAA tournament appearances later, the wheels began to fall off. Three arrested players tainted Jones’ reputation at Virginia, and a losing record on the court certainly didn’t make things any better.
When leading scorer Courtney Alexander was accused of hitting, kicking and choking his girlfriend in June 1997, Jones ignored suggestions from his higher-ups in the athletic department and dismissed Alexander from the team. The move left a hole in the Virginia lineup and a growing rift between Jones and the administration.
Jones was fired after the 1998 season.
“There were lots and lots of great memories [at Virginia], and obviously when you fall short and you don’t do as well towards the end, those are the ones that, initially, you remember the most,” he said. “But I think we experienced a pretty good level of success. I’m not sure that Virginia’s been back to that level of success since.
“In fact,” Jones continued with a sly smile, “I’m sure that they haven’t been back to that level of success.”
———-
The year after Jones was fired was both the best and worst time of his life. He actually enjoyed his summer for the first time he could remember, spending time at beaches instead of hunting down recruits. But by October, the familiar itch of basketball season returned. Jones needed it. He desperately missed the sport.
He signed on to broadcast a few college basketball games with what is now Comcast Sports. But between those games was when Jones really took off. From early November to the middle of spring, Jones embarked on a whirlwind tour visiting the country’s best college coaches. He watched Gary Williams at Maryland and Tom Penders at George Washington. Bob Huggins at Cincinnati and Skip Prosser at Xavier. Rick Majerus at Utah – twice. Dave Odom at Wake Forest. Tubby Smith at Kentucky. College teammate Rick Carlisle, who was then an assistant coach with the Indiana Pacers.
Altogether, the coaches Jones visited have accrued 4,210 wins.
“It was kind of like my sabbatical,” he said of the trip. “Those guys allowed me to see inside – it was great. The thing I’ve always told people is you pick up some new stuff and new perspective, but it also sometimes reinforces your beliefs in your way of doing things. There’s a lot of different ways to be successful, and every place you went, you could see that coach’s imprint, their personality, their style.”
———-
Jones brought a style of his own to American when he was hired to resurrect the flailing program in 2000. In his first year, he held practices at 6 a.m. every morning to send a message to his players: the losing ways of the past were unacceptable.
Losing is as unacceptable now, more than a dozen years later, as it was then. Jones hates losing. Abhors it. And he makes it very clear to his players that if they lose, it won’t be for a lack of effort. Jones works his players as hard as anyone starting point guard Danny Munoz has ever played for.
“I think anyone who plays Division I college basketball is going to be a hard worker coming into collegiate athletics, but there’s another step that you really have to go to when you get here your freshman year. It’s not something that’s easy, at all, and he really pushes you to get there,” Munoz said. “Putting everything that you have into one thing is so important to him and that’s why I think you see a team each year at AU that plays as hard as it can. Because it comes from him.”
Jones berates his players during games and yells more than he talks. To an average fan this may look like insanity or a need for anger management classes, but for Jones it’s an outward expression of his passion for the game and his players. He doesn’t yell at them because they screwed up – he yells at them because he so desperately wants them to reach their potential.
“My style, whatever that is, is not for everybody,” Jones said. “But when the players know that the coaches care about them, and the players care about one another, I think that – in terms of their experience while they’re here – that adds a lot.”
Contrary to popular belief, Jones does have a soft side, too. He’s a generally easygoing person away from the court. He has three kids – Meghann, Madison and Jeffrey – and a spacious house in suburban Arlington. He’s a diehard Redskins fan. And in between practices and games, Jones doesn’t get too swept up by the pressures of basketball to appreciate the process.
“It’s kind of weird thinking of Coach Jones off the court because that’s where you spend the most time with him, but when we’re just at the hotel or the day before the game, he’s happy and jokes around with us,” Munoz explained. “He’s a laidback guy. He likes to have a good time and have some laughs just like everyone else.”
———-
It’s been 19 years since Jones was asked about how he would spend the next 20, but now the question is being posed to him again. He smiles at the thought and thinks about all that’s happened in the past two decades – the good and the bad, the firing and the hiring, the trips across the country and trips on the court. As he thinks, the fire-and-brimstone version of Jones slowly shrinks away. In his place is simply an aging man contemplating the future. With a healthy family and steady job, he counts himself as blessed.
The fiery basketball coach leans forward on the desk and stares straight ahead. His eyes are a steely blue. He’s never really had a plan for the future or a grasp on the past. But when asked where he’ll be in 20 years, this time around, he knows exactly what to say.
“God,” Jones says, “I hope I’m at a beach somewhere.”

2013-09-12,AU,India,"Krishna Temple in Udupi
I’m a “When in Rome” type of person, and by that I mean that I try to fit in when visiting a foreign country. 
All too aware of the stigma attached to Americans abroad, I try my best to be culturally sensitive and respect the locals. Sometimes I can tell this is appreciated. Other times it ends in hilarity.
By my pale skin alone, it’s clear that I am foreign. Still, I dress in traditional Indian clothing, stand up when professors enter the room and eat exclusively with my right hand, sitting on my left to avoid making a giant faux pas. 
But India is a place of tradition and rituals like no other, and since I came here knowing next to nothing about them, the learning curve has been steep. The smallest things bring me back to freshman year when I didn’t know how to use the laundry machines and got lost going to Tenleytown. 
Even things like crossing the road are different. Traffic not only comes from the opposite direction, but crosswalks and sidewalks are nonexistent. If they do appear they are not respected by the motorcycles, cars, auto rickshaws, bicycles, pedestrians and animals that all use the streets of Manipal. Within my first week I learned from experience that perhaps the only time a rickshaw will stop to let you cross is when you slip and fall in its path. Maybe I was just lucky.
A pinnacle of this learning process came during a Krishna Janmashtami celebration a couple weeks ago. Krishna Janmashtami is the birth of the Hindu deity Krishna. A few of us decided to go to the service at the local temple, wanting to experience the holiday. The service was completely in Sanskrit, but we sat cross-legged in the crowd, attempting to follow along. When people stood, I stood. When gongs and bells sounded, I tried not to jump. When people lined up to receive a blessing, I followed, not knowing what the blessing was, but dutifully taking the holy water and thanking Krishna as I put it on my head.
Finally, the ceremony ended, and it was time for the free food promised to us from the beginning. Like most college students, free food is one thing that I know. I am good at receiving free food. But instead of Georgetown cupcakes, these baked goods were easily 95 percent sugar, had a texture resembling chalk and were liberally piled on my plate. The main dish was not pizza, but a heavy rice dish with coconut. I soon realized that there was no way I could finish this small mountain of food. 
And this was a problem. As part of the ceremony, you have to finish since the food was blessed by Krishna. The temple was soon empty with only our group of Americans and half-full plates remaining. As the priests started cleaning up, our desperation grew. Looking around for a trashcan or stray dog, I slipped a few of the baked goods into my bag to make my plate look emptier and motioned for others to do the same. We discreetly stacked our plates with the empty ones on top, concealing the mounds of leftover curry. With my bag full of baked goods, I guiltily left the temple, feeling more American than usual. 
Forgive me, Krishna, I thought. I’m but a mere foreigner.

2013-12-10,AU,India,"Houseboat tour on the backwaters of Kerala, India.
As difficult as it is to accept, my study abroad is over. I left Manipal four days ago at 5:30 a.m., sent off by my friends and loving resident director, who came bearing hot coffee. I don’t think even my own mother would walk a mile up a hill carrying a pot of coffee at 5 a.m. just to keep me sane on my journey south. As the car rounded the bend, leaving Manipal behind, tears started streaming down my face, the driver clearly uncomfortable with the crying white girl in his back seat.
During my flight to Kochi and the hours that I spent in the fancy hotel waiting for my parents’ arrival from Mumbai, I tried to come to terms with the fact that my study abroad had ended. Had I changed? What had I actually gained? 
My parents and I spent the next couple of days bumming around Fort Cochin, a touristy enclave in the southern state of Kerala. Watching my parents try to adapt to India was hilarious: they were undoubtedly American, smiling and saying hello to each person they passed on the street, looking confused and shell shocked when auto-rickshaw drivers pestered us to get in and not knowing what the different dishes were on menus at restaurants. Each time they didn’t understand what somebody said, they turned and looked at me and I gladly translated Indian English to American English and vice versa.
Our third day there we went on a backwaters tour. For the first time in four months, I was with strangers who were not Indian, which was unnerving in an unexpected way. All were tourists who had been in the country for a month or less, and I couldn’t help but feel a little superior to them as they talked about how crazy the traffic was and other things I had long since gotten used to.
Halfway through the tour, our guide asked us where we were all from. He was confused when he got to me: “You have been in India a long time. I can tell; you understand me better,” he said. I could have died with happiness.
While I am obviously still seeking closure to my abroad experience, traveling with my fresh-off-the-boat parents through this overwhelming country has shown me that I have learned to be Indian, for the most part. On the Delhi Metro this morning, packed like sardines even though it wasn’t even rush hour, I didn’t notice the masses staring until my mom pointed it out. While my parents flinched at every close call on the ride to the airport, I slept through it, unfazed by the obviously unsafe driving. I know how to ignore beggars, touts and people selling just about everything like the best of them. I’ve become all but immune to the smell of urine and sewage. I’ve learned to appreciate the chaos and the hubbub; never will you find a country more alive.
Who knows what I actually learned this study abroad, but I know that India will never be a total puzzle to me again.

2014-02-11,AU,India,"“Orange is the New Black” actress and activist Laverne Cox reflected on her life as a transgender woman of color on Feb. 11.
“One is not born a woman, but becomes one,” Cox said at the start of her speech, citing Simone De Beauvoir. 
Women’s Initiative sponsored the event and presented Cox as their Women’s History Month Speaker. 
By the time the doors to Ward 1 opened at 7 p.m., the line to hear Laverne Cox speak had wrapped three times around the basement and was already out the door. 
Cox began by describing what she referred to as “a state of emergency for trans people.” She shared terrifying statistics regarding the exponentially high homicide, unemployment and violence rates for trans people, particularly trans people of color.
Much to Cox’s delight, the audience soon developed a system of snaps for times where they appreciated or agreed with one of her sentiments. 
After giving an overview of the subject, she spoke of her own story of growing up in Mobile, Ala. 
“Everyone was telling me I was a boy,” she said, “but I knew I was a girl.” 
She faced harassment from classmates and teachers, and was not accepted by her mother, a devout member of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
After a suicide attempt in the sixth grade, Cox poured herself into achievement, citing Alice Miller’s “The Drama of the Gifted Child,” in which a child repressing trauma feels they must overcompensate in other areas of their life. 
This need for achievement allowed her to transfer into the Alabama School of Fine Arts, where she noticed more than ever the implications of the intersections of race, gender, sexuality and class. 
After graduating from ASFA, Cox attended Indiana University, but transferred to Marymount College in New York after two years. She said that most of her education came from outside of Marymount and in the New York City club scene, where gender expression was celebrated instead of shamed. She met other trans women who caused her to question her misconceptions and eventually inspired her to begin her own transition. 
Six years after she began her transitioning process, Cox was still being “spooked” (spotted as trans) on the street. She recalled experiencing countless instances of street harassment and one assault.
“Calling a transgender woman a man is an act of violence,” she said, also emphasizing the importance of pronouns. 
In regards to the recent controversy regarding Janet Mock’s appearance on Piers Morgan, Cox said “Piers Morgan had difficulty hearing outside of his own narrative in order to hear Janet’s,” then, with a smirk, “Wow, that was diplomatic.”
During the following Q&A session, Cox accepted an honorary bid to Gamma Rho Lambda, a multicultural, LGBTQ-inclusive sorority on campus. 
By interjecting humor and honesty in a serious discussion about the intersections of misogyny, transphobia and race, Cox delivered a message of positivity and love. Students who originally came to see Sophia from “Orange is the New Black” left with a desire to overcome the patriarchy and resist oppression. 
And for that, we give her snaps.

2014-03-07,AU,India,"On an overcrowded public bus in India, a man on the work commute gets felt up by a smiley, wrinkly stranger; no one notices. Across town, another man stares up at a ceiling fan, waiting to die.
Director Ritesh Batra lifts a magnifying glass to modern-day Mumbai—a city bursting at the seams—to examine these most microscopic stories of human interaction. “I think we forget things if we have no one to tell them to,” one character muses. Often, these stories and connections in “The Lunchbox” are fascinating and unexpected.
The story begins with a happy accident, giving life to one of the film’s favorite lines: “Sometimes the wrong train can lead you to the right station.”
One day, the dabbawala (a lunch delivery service) mistakenly drops middle-class widower Saajan Fernandez (Irrfan Khan) a lunchbox from a young woman named Ila (Nimrat Kaur). The box was meant to go to her husband. Noticing the mistake, she pens a note to Fernandez, and tucks it into the lunchbox for delivery. Despite the original mistake, Saajan and Ila allow the mismatched deliveries to continue, communicating back and forth via lunchbox letter. In time, they develop an unconventional but rewarding friendship.
Andante-paced, sprinkled with humor, The Lunchbox is a collective of snapshot stories on what it means to connect with another human being. The mundane humdrum of modern life in Mumbai is captured gorgeously in cultural context. The tantalizing possibility of future change is portrayed with lingering, sometimes indulgent shots of Saajan and Ila lost deep in thought.
While impressive for what it accomplishes in just over 100 minutes, The Lunchbox comes off as almost a dream-like teaser clip, hesitating to commit itself to any kind of concrete conclusion or resolution. Much is left unanswered. The film takes its time, exploring human action and reaction, and is enjoyable in what it accomplishes, but does so at the expense of a fuller, richer ending.
At its core, “The Lunchbox” is very human, with each character searching for acknowledgment and love in society. The film is enjoyable as a diluted, but elegant cultural drama on micro-level human relationships and self-discovery.

The Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation identifies students with a passion for public service and awards them $30,000 towards graduate school. Brazill and Rodriguez have joined the ranks of people like former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and senior CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. 
AU has been home to 13 Truman scholars since 2000, including Brazill and Rodriguez. Around 600 candidates are nominated for the scholarship by their universities, according to the Truman Scholarship website. Out of those, 59 students became Truman Scholars in 2014. 
Mary Caroline Brazill
Despite a long history of public service, Brazill wasn’t initially sure that the Truman Scholarship was for her.
“I knew I wanted to do work in local communities in Sub-Saharan Africa,” Brazill wrote in an email, “and I had this image in my mind of Truman winners as very government, policy-level based.”
It wasn’t until she dug deeper into past scholars that Brazill decided to start the application process. According to Brazill, the initial application is 15 short answer questions and a section where the applicant identifies a flaw in a piece of legislation and proposes a solution.
Brazill wrote more than 10 drafts of her application before submitting it.
“About three-fourths of the way through, I ended up revamping the tone and emphasis of my entire application, which was simultaneously exciting and terrifying, but definitely the right decision,” she said.
It ultimately paid off. Brazill’s application was chosen for a panel interview, where she competed with eight people for the Pennsylvania scholarship. 
“I was really surprised at how many people were internationally focused— Arabic speakers, Chinese speakers and multiple students flown in from study abroad locations,” she said. “[I felt] unbelievably anxious and honestly a bit defeated. I thought I didn’t measure up.”
Brazill was at her internship with the Department of State. Late in the afternoon, she received a phone call from an unknow District of Columbia number.
“I ran to the back of the office in our big conference room, shut the door, took a breath and answered the call,” Brazill said. “President Kerwin was on the other end of the line, and he told me congratulations, that I had won! I remember letting out a bit of a scream— sorry, President Kerwin— and asking him if he was serious.” 
Brazill is no stranger to accepting awards. She spent the past year in Zanzibar, Tanzania as a 2013 Boren Scholar, where she became an advanced Swahili speaker. That time abroad helped solidify her commitment to working with local communities, she said. 
“I felt most valuable and most competent when I was interviewing local lawyers or holding an hour long workshop with secondary school students about human rights,” she said.
Before grad school, Brazill hopes to spend one to two years in Sub-Saharan Africa. After completing a graduate degree in human rights studies, she said she hopes to enter the non-profit sector and work on designing and implementing post-conflict programing.
“I know conflict resolution is complex, multi-dimensional and challenging,” Brazill said. “I was taught that there is always a solution; where there is a will, there is a way. Regardless of circumstances or emotions or obstacles, I was told that I had the ability to navigate the twists and turns and to find an answer.”
Eric Rodriguez
Eric Rodriguez, 27, is a first-generation college student from the Yakama Reservation in Wapato, Washington.
“I was born and raised on the reservation,” he said. “I grew up in the housing projects. That’s where [my family] still live[s], they’re still there.”
Rodriguez’s experience with public service started early. At 18, he became a volunteer firefighter and once he turned 21, a tribal police officer.
“It was basically just trying to change the philosophy of policing and being proactive,” he said. 
As a police officer, Rodriguez addressed issues like teen suicide and domestic violence. He realized he needed to get his degree when he went to tribal high schools and encouraged the graduating seniors to attend college. 
“One person asked me, ‘So where did you go to school?’ and I didn’t finish community college,” he said. “So I just knew I had to go back to school and finish my education, so I could make more of an impact.”
The best place to make an impact was at AU. Going to school in D.C. meant that Rodriguez could learn about how federal American Indian policies were developed, he said.  So two and a half years ago, over six years after he graduated high school, Rodriguez started at AU.
The Truman Scholarship is not the first award Rodriguez won as an AU student. In 2013, he was awarded the Udall scholarship for tribal public policy. From there, the Office of Merit awards suggested he look into the Truman Scholarship. 
“It kind of fit perfectly, because [public service] is what I want to do anyway,” Rodriguez said.
After sending in his application, the Office of Merit awards held mock interviews to help Rodriguez prepare.
“I think the mock interviews were more rigorous than the actual interview,” he said, laughing.  According to Rodriguez, the Truman interview was 20 minutes, with around eight people asking him questions.
Rodriguez graduated from AU earlier this May with a degree in anthropology and plans to go to law school this fall. Rodriguez wants to use that education as an in-house tribal lawyer. Tribal leaders go to attorneys to make decisions, he said, meaning that’s the best place to make a positive impact.
“It’s trying to bridge that knowledge of growing up, going through the customs and traditions and then having a legal background to be able to interpret that,” he said. “It’s being able to interpret traditional knowledge into a type of argument you can bring in front of a court.”

2015-10-12,AU,India,"Texas-raised Alan Palomo—better known as Neon Indian—will perform at the 9:30 Club on Oct. 13. The artist is set to release his latest album “VEGA INTL. Night School” on Oct. 16, Palomo’s first recording since his 2011 release of “Era Extraña.”
You can already listen to the singles “Slumlord,” “Annie” and “The Glitzy Hive” from “VEGA INTL Night School.” A music video for “Slumlord” will also be released soon, according to  pictures posted on Palomo’s Instagram account.

On the upcoming album, Palomo reverts back to the glitchy tendencies and electro-pop sensibilities that first gave Neon Indian its cosmic quality in “Psychic Chasms” (2009). While Palomo is moving away from the humorous elements of “Psychic Chasms,” which included track names like “Laughing Gas,” “Should Have Taken Acid With You” and “Terminally Chill,” his new album still keeps things light-hearted and merry.

The newest singles from “VEGA INTL. Night School” make listeners feel life they are simultaneously in paradise and living in a modern version of Miami Vice. Much more energetic than “Psychic Chasms,” yet unshakably beachy, the latest album assures that concert-goers will have a kinetic and unique experience at the 9:30 Club on Oct. 13.
New Zealand native and New York-based vocalist Tamaryn will open for Neon Indian. Tamaryn will showcase her latest album, “Cranekiss,” released August 2015.

2016-05-13,AU,India,"(Courtesy of IFC Films)
The Man Who Knew Infinity is the story of the math genius, Srinivasa Ramanujan who is famous for making groundbreaking contributions to theoretical mathematics.  
Interestingly enough, the film doesn’t fail in making formula-writing into riveting plot material. It fails in the ways that a lot of the “genius genre” films do: oscillating between melodrama and unbridled wide-eyed “oh, aren’t you impressed” theatrics. The authenticity rings hollow and the film falls victim to many overused tropes--namely the “obscurity to recognition” trajectory of geniuses and the fact that only the West is deemed authoritative enough to recognize geniuses.
Ramanujan (Dev Patel) is a self-taught mathematician living in India, barely scraping by as an accounting clerk. In his spare time, he writes formulas for ideas such as  the number of partitions a number has, with the number growing to infinity. He writes a letter with his work to G.H. Hardy (Jeremy Irons), a mathematician at Trinity College in Cambridge. Hardy is so impressed by Ramanujan that he summons him to England to learn more about his theories.
The relationship between Hardy and Ramanujan is easily the most compelling part of the film, as the audience  hardly gets to know much about Ramanujan other than his work. Ramanujan credits divine inspiration for his incalculable formulas—he says it’s intuition that things are right is all he needs. Hardy is presented as an atheist who couldn’t possibly grasp the mystical ways of Hinduism. 
This precisely is the issue with the film—you won’t have to look far for “Orientalist” overtones, ad infinitum. Ramanujan’s spirituality is presented clumsily, replete with elephant Ganesha statues and all sorts of reductionistic motifs. He is made to look provincial in mind—merely the vessel for genius bestowed from up above.
The colonial mentality of England is presented surprisingly well, on the other hand. Everyone, but a few people like Hardy, make little effort to hide their disdain for Ramanujan’s Indian origin and humble beginnings. Micro aggressions including  not being allowed to step on the grass at Cambridge abound. 
Jeremy Irons plays Hardy beautifully, as a man wanting to help Ramanujan but perhaps too timid in facing down the pervasive racism leveled at his protégé. He publishes Ramanujan’s work and seeks to get him a fellowship but not once does he actually ever address the colonial mentality espoused by his colleagues—he simply, and formulaically, advocates for Ramanujan as a mathematician, not as a person.
Dev Patel, too, stays mired in playing Ramanujan as a bumbling country bumpkin;  tall, gawky and impossibly awkward in every sense. All he wants, he says, is to publish and  to get people to read his work, the scope of which is mind-boggling. In a true genius sense, he can’t be bothered with Hardy’s pedantics of proving theories. 
The viewers are made to feel as though he has so many ideas bursting forth, it is all he can do to keep up with even so much as recording them. But the person gets lost in the formulas. We never understand, for example, much about his love for his wife, whom he left behind in India. We get little nuancing of him other than as a repository for other-worldly ideas. In the midst of all of this, mawkishness abounds… soft lighting and Indian sitar strains do, too.

2016-08-10,AU,India,"Krista Chavez (pictured left). 
In 2016, voters are using their relationships to swing the vote toward their own party. 
According to a new study by the Pew Research Center, few Clinton or Trump supporters look for friendships in the opposite party. Among registered-to-vote Trump supporters, only 4% have “a lot” of close friends supporting Clinton. This number is more dramatic in relation to registered-to-vote Clinton supporters, with only 2% saying they have “a lot” of close friends supporting Trump. Further, Trump supporters have a lot (44%) of friends supporting Trump, and some friends (38%) supporting him. 16% of Trump voters have “just a few” or “none” of their friends swinging for Clinton. The same goes for Clinton’s voters, with 31% saying they have no close friends who support the opposition.
The data tells us that people are less willing to build friendships with those who support different viewpoints. This explains the widespread polarization in media, pop culture, communities, and the United States as a whole. The age bracket of 18-29 -- Millennials, including college students -- reflects this isolated trend. With 58% of Clinton supporters saying none of their close friends support the other candidate, only 34% of Trump supporters say the same.
As I have different viewpoints than the majority of my peers on AU’s campus, these figures do not surprise me. Another study by Pew supports my feelings by reporting that 40% of Millennials ages 18-34 support the government censoring “offensive” speech. The data highlights the decline in acceptance of other views in America, and how alternative opinions are viewed on modern college campuses.
Examining this idea more in depth, OKCupid released a new study detailing how partisanship actually influences a person’s dating profile. Their research concluded that “the amount of OkCupid users who couldn’t date someone with opposing political views is at 50% — a number that’s been rising since 2008.” 
Apparently, voting even counts when seeking a proper life partner. Personally, this is not surprising. Most people seek a partner who holds their same values that can grow and thrive in a family. Therefore it is only logical that one chooses another to spread these values within the home.
The OKCupid study found that in dating profiles, liberals are likely to feature interests like “The Daily Show, Broad City, NPR, podcasts, and weed,” and conservatives are likely to use words like “Jesus, Faith, Country, and Guns.” Bipartisan overlaps for words include “INTP (a Meyers-Briggs personality type), Outlander, Indiana, iPhone, Adventure, Honesty, and Considerate.”
Examining these polls, both parties express different values that are not only attractive when voting, but also when choosing friends and partners. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it is upsetting when a large portion of the U.S. youth population is wary to hear different viewpoints, unregulated speech, and expression. 
As a founding principle of the United States, free speech was intended to support minorities from the dictatorship of the majority. It appears that many millennials do not feel that way, especially when choosing friends and spouses.
At the end of the day, it is a good thing we can all agree: honesty and consideration are good characteristics for partners. But maybe appreciating our partners and friend groups’ differences can be just as valuable.

2016-10-13,AU,India,"I believe it is appropriate, and even ironic due to the fact we attend American University, to discuss America. Gallup polls have questioned the average United States citizen asking, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud?” Based off of this polling, the percentage of Americans to answer ‘extremely proud’ has dropped from 70 percent in 2003 to 52 percent this year. Not only is this an 18 percent drop, but this is the lowest number that has ever been polled.
Much of the negativity that has recently permeated the country is due to renewed conversations on the effects of extensive military involvement abroad, the decline in rank of our education and healthcare systems, and our mass incarceration rates that are the highest in the world. Although there is an abundant amount of other statistics that could further confirm the state of ‘mayhem’ that the United States currently resides in, I will attempt to reverse some of this negativity by demonstrating the many ways the United States still remains number one.
Despite recent economic recession and stagnant growth, we still have the world’s largest GDP. According to the World Bank, our GDP last year was 17.95 trillion dollars. Second place was China at 10.87 trillion. Our GDP is higher than third place Japan, fourth place Germany, fifth place United Kingdom, sixth place France, seventh place India and eighth place Italy combined. Somehow, someway, the United States remains the economic powerhouse of the world. Along with the GDP, the United States household spending is the highest in the world. We consume over 25 percent of the world’s household consumption. One out of every four goods that are consumed go to someone in the United States. This makes us the number one consumer market in the world – and by far.
We also help feed the world. When it comes to overall food production, we lag behind China and India. Our country does lead in corn production and other specific foods, but when it comes to overall food production we rank third. Under the topic of food exports, the United States takes the lead. We export $118.3 billion worth of food every year, more than any other country. That being said, even though America is notorious for having high rates of obesity, every two years at the Olympics we show just how fit we are. We have the most gold medals (1,022), the most silver medals (794), the most bronze medals (704) and the most medals total (2,520). Our gold medal count is higher than the total medal count of every other country, not including the former Soviet Union.
The military remains the most well-funded military to ever inhabit the earth. The military spending dwindled from $700 billion to the $600 billion that it averages around now. This extreme expense allows for technological advancement and progress to outperform any of our expectations. We were the first country to create a nuclear weapon and continue to innovate when it comes to our military might. On top of this, our defense spending outdoes the next 20 countries on the list combined. Furthermore, when we think about the United States and its work abroad, we must remember that we are the country that contributes to more foreign aid than any other nation. 34 billion dollars in foreign aid is distributed to over 100 different nations. The nation we currently give the most federal aid to is Israel. Just about half of the nations worldwide receive the benefit of U.S. foreign aid.
Just taking a look around the American University campus, this next piece should not be a surprise. Students from foreign countries flock to colleges and universities in the United States because of the quality of education this country provides. The United States holds 181 of the top 750 best universities in the world, compared to second place China which consists of 57 of the top 750 top universities. Even when it comes to music, films, literature or any other part of American culture, we tend to have the most global influence in the world. Any country you visit will most likely play music and watch movies that originate from the United States.
So, if I were to ever be polled with the question of, “How proud are you to be an American – extremely proud, very proud, moderately proud, only a little proud or not at all proud,” I would firmly answer extremely proud. We may have our setbacks and flaws, but looking at how far we have come and where we stand in the world today, the United States is the greatest country in the world.

2017-04-10,AU,India,"A new and highly concentrated major in dance is currently under review by AU administration to be approved as a major. While dance is currently available as a minor, a major would expand the class offerings for students. 
Britta J. Peterson, the director of the dance program at AU, said that the major was designed with the AU student in mind. The proposed program is structured so that students who enroll in the major may still double major, study abroad, have multiple minors and be able to intern while earning 43 credits toward their dance major.
The foundation of the program would be what Peterson calls “Embodied Knowledge,” or dance technique classes, which could include different types of dance, such as urban and Indian dance forms. Students will also be able to learn about other relevant topics including anatomy and the history, technology and business of dance.
“I know that when our students enter the field, they are going to have the hard skills to do their work,” Peterson said. 
The program will be geared to the interests and career goals of the student, Peterson said. 
“What we see is that the dance student is in the driver seat, and then me and my colleagues are hanging in the side car, making sure people don’t run off the road or hit a pothole,” she said. “And if you do, we’re there to help pick you up.” 
The process of introducing a brand new major at AU is a long one, Peterson said. She has been working on developing the program for the past few months, and discussions about proposing and implementing a major have been happening for years. The wait could be over: the board will meet this spring, and if approved, the dance major may become a reality for students at AU this fall.
“We talked to students, we [did] all this past research, looked at what classes have been offered, which classes have worked, what other people are doing across the nation that’s working,” Peterson said.
She has also revamped the dance minor to be more diverse and fit into the schedules of students. The movement classes, based in different types of dance, are proposed to be two credits, giving students the opportunity to add dance into their schedules even if they are not a dance major or minor. The changes for the minor are included with the major proposal and will be implemented if it is approved by the board. 
Emma Rawley, a sophomore in the College of Arts and Sciences, is taking an intermediate jazz course this semester with Britta Peterson. She is involved in AU in Motion, AU’s largest student-run dance organization, with a focus on jazz and modern dance. She is looking forward to the changes to the dance program. 
“Maybe AU will start to seem like something more than just SIS,” Rawley said. “People can start to see it as more diverse.”
Jean Thompson, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs, also spends a lot of her time on AU in Motion and wishes that the dance major was in place when she enrolled at AU as a freshman. 
“I would have definitely tried to double major in dance,” Thompson said.
Thompson said she was hesitant about declaring the minor as she had always been classically trained in ballet, but is excited to see what the new major will incorporate with its diversity of dance forms. 
“You don’t have to be a major to take these classes,” Peterson said. “Everyone is welcome.” 
Peterson said that the dance department is invested in inclusion, and her colleagues’ different perspectives and expertise is what will give the program its depth. 
Peterson encourages all students that are interested to come to the “Dance Works,” the annual spring dance concert featuring the American University Dance Company. This will give an opportunity for students to see the work of current dance students and experience the new perspective of the dance program, she said. The show is set for April 21-22 at the AU Greenberg Theatre at 8 p.m. Tickets are available here.

2017-05-05,AU,India,"Those professors among us who teach from the perspective of the oppressed are often tasked with un-teaching what our students learned before arriving. As we know, the education system is a crucial site of social (re)production, fully complicit in the art of domination. Children learn that our American hands are clean and our rule is just. To inculcate each new generation of patriots, Cowboys (or Cubs) fight Indians, “good” guys are pitted against bad hombres, super-predators, terrorists, the axis of evil. A children’s textbook in Texas refers to African slaves as migrant “workers.” Hegemony is secured in the rewriting of history. The original sin has been erased.
So this becomes a dilemma. It is difficult to talk of a shared heritage that celebrates victories of subjugation and extermination when one is not herself of the lineage of the conqueror, but to do otherwise contradicts the stories we as a collective – “we the people” – tell. This collective worldview endows on the conquered the Hegelian double consciousness of master and slave that W.E.B. Du Bois so eloquently extended to the black American. The master can only be shocked, angered or insulted when Beyoncé gets in formation or when Colin Kaepernick takes a knee. The master is not repulsed by the portrait of Andrew Jackson, who once offered $50 and “ten dollars extra, for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of three hundred” for his runaway slave, that hangs in the Oval Office.
The slave, by contrast, cannot but know the horror because she embodies our original sin.
The historical record is contested because its narrative pervades our lived present. It is ongoing. And while the “alternative facts” of the 45th Administration are so flagrant as to seem abnormal, our standard education is one of alt history, alt economics, alt politics, and certainly alt race relations. The “alt right” is brought to us courtesy of our alt education.
Power is a shape-shifter, and,with every gain of the subjugated, it manifests anew. So when Jim Crow at home and colonial rule abroad became untenable, racism came to be depicted not as a systemic or structural force but rather a problem of the racist individual. Being stripped of the institutions of racial domination, in other words, necessitated the erasure of their structural legacies. It pushed the problem of racism to that of racists, easily denounced in the collective purge of racist offenders. A generation is raised on this erasure, and claims colorblindness with the same surety as its sibling claims of neutrality, objectivity and universality. What’s wrong with All Lives Matter, the master asks? Doesn’t Black Lives Matter simply perpetuate these false divisions?
What’s all the fuss over a banana?
We have been here before.
The personal aberration, the defective racist, finds her corollary in personal responsibility. So after a half century it becomes legitimate to dismantle affirmative action, when studies show that it would take 228 years for black families to close the wealth gap with white families. When last year The Washington Post declared, “Net worth of white households in D.C. region is 81 times that of black households,” and described a “racial wealth gap” that, while frequently attributed to “individual character flaws” in fact represents “an extensive history of the structural barriers in local and national policies, Supreme Court rulings, programs and practices that created wealth for many White families and prevented wealth accumulation or stripped wealth from many Black families.”
The myth of personal responsibility is built on the erasure of America’s original sin. Thus it is with no small irony that I write as an AU professor in Washington DC, the belly of the beast.
The education system, a crucial site of social (re)production, cannot but be complicit in the art of domination. We are the intelligentsia, engaged in a war of position, which is all too often the intellectual production of revision and denial.
How then might we make agency of our double consciousness?
In reaction to Monday’s hate crime, occurring just as Taylor Dumpson became the first black woman president of AU’s Student Government, and against the national backdrop of the police murder of fifteen year-old Jordan Edwards and the failure of the Justice Department to prosecute in the fatal police shooting of Alton Sterling, the AU Faculty Senate proposed a Permanent AU Commission for Anti-Discrimination that aims to “develop the most advanced model in higher education for anti-discriminatory policies and accountability in the nation.” 
I applaud the measure. But we must go further, to the heart of our mission as an institution of higher education: let us decolonize. Let us challenge ourselves to be the most advanced model for teaching truth to power. When “diversity” and “inclusion” are superfluous add-ons, seminars and weekend workshops separated from the “real” work that “serious” scholars do, our students take the cue. In 2017, an AU student can still graduate without learning that this country and this world looks the way it does for reasons that make “we the people” look bad. Moreover, the classes that teach these truths are too often set apart as less stringent scholarship or posed as alternative readings of what is otherwise a normative reality. Is this what we want from the next generation of informed citizens in a multicultural world?
Responding to systemic incidents on this campus and elsewhere, the belated conversation around curricular change has begun: we are seeing the Habits of Mind AUx take effect, a Racial Literacy project went forward last year, a series of interdisciplinary degrees under the Critical Race, Gender, and Culture Studies Collaborative are unfolding, and faculty have submitted an AU2030 Social Equity Initiative proposal. May this be merely the beginning of something much greater. It is only when we un-teach the lies of the past that claims to a shared heritage will mean something other than the art of domination.

2017-08-11,AU,India,"There is no comprehensive reporting system for the number of missing and murdered Native American women and girls in the United States--the only category of missing persons without one. Many reports, however, estimate that Native women are murdered at more than 10 times the 
	national average.

	“Wind River,” although fictional, portrays this bleak reality with a steely resolve. Screenwriter and director 
	Taylor Sheridan (“Sicario” and “Hell and High Water”) paints a picture of life on a reservation in muted, grim tones. The film brings to vivid life how drugs have ravaged the community, how violence so often punctures the fabric of daily existence, how Native culture has been obliterated and how the reservation is a place both forgotten and stigmatized.

Jeremy Renner plays Cory Lambert, a federal wildlife officer who hunts predatory animals at the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. While searching for a mountain lion that has been attacking livestock, he finds the raped and beaten body of a young Native woman in the snow. The tracks point to a seeming impossibility--that she had been running barefoot through the snow for miles. Natalie (Kelsey Asbille), the best friend of Cory’s daughter, had died three years earlier under similar circumstances.

	Rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (
	Elizabeth Olsen) flies in from Vegas, where she is stationed, to investigate the crime. The Tribal Police chief, who has come to accept law enforcement’s utter lack of concern for his people, jokingly remarks, “see what they send us,” when she arrives clad in summery attire in the midst of a blizzard. But Jane is different. The absolute brutality and violence women are subjected to at Wind River shakes her to her core. Olsen makes palpable the feeling of a woman contending with violence against women─as something that feels intensely and viscerally personal.

	Jane asks Cory to help her in the investigation. That dynamic is also really interesting since Jane lacks the typical authority figure hubris. Witnessing the dynamics in a community that has received no help from “the government,” she recognizes that Cory can not only “help her hunt a predator” but that he can also earn the trust of the community, which has no reason to trust anyone outside of it.

	“Wind River” is a so much more than a taut murder mystery. Free of polemics, Sheridan’s director hand turns the lens on how elusive “justice” can be for the Native American community, on multiple levels. Finding the perpetrator of this specific crime can’t offer the satisfaction traditional murder mystery films offer in catching the bad guy, because most other victims never get the dignity of having someone care to find the perpetrators.

	“Wind River” will shake you to your core, but it is an important film to see.

2018-10-11,AU,India,"The Little Wild Things Curry
Our weekly search for restaurants that probably aren’t on your radar. As young, broke college kids we will bring you our honest reviews of affordable restaurants in dope neighborhoods.
Calling out all veggie lovers, this one’s for you. And even if you aren’t into vegetables, you’ll still be interested in this review. 
After the Festival of India’s exhibit on vegetarianism on the quad, we decided to go for a healthier option this week, and we didn’t have to look very far.
We decided to hit up Beefsteak, which is right by the AU-Tenleytown Metro stop. Created by legendary D.C. chef Jose Andres, Beefsteak puts veggies “center stage.” As soon as you walk in the door, you immediately pick up on the restaurant's environmentally friendly vibe. All the produce here is locally sourced. 
We decided to try The Edan, the Little Wild Things Curry and the Beefsteak Burger. These are the most popular dishes, and get a 100 percent recommendation from us. 
The Edan veggie bowl has so much to offer. It’s filled with quinoa, edamame, zucchini, cilantro sauce, garlic yogurt and cucumber salad. 
The Little Wild Things Curry has rice, lentils, carrots, spring onion blend, kale, kohlrabi, green curry sauce, toasted sesame seeds and radish. 
Our last dish, the Beefsteak Burger, was definitely our favorite. It’s quite simply unlike any burger we’ve ever tried. It’s made from marinated beets, pickled red onions, leaf lettuce, tomatoes, sprouts, vegan chipotle mayo, olive oil and sea salt on an olive oil brioche. Although this burger is entirely meatless, it is topped with a delicious tomato that adds in the extra taste and makes up for the lack of meat. We were skeptical at first too, but you’re going to have to trust us on this one. We also recommend adding avocado to yours if you’re feeling extra hungry. 
We’d describe Beefsteak as a healthier Chipotle that gives you a variety of fresh, locally grown vegetables at your fingertips. The chill environment is similar to that of a cozy coffee shop, and we’d definitely recommend it as a place to hang and study. 
Each table has outlets and USB ports, so you could spend hours there doing work if you, hypothetically, haven’t started studying for any of your exams. The USB ports are also great if you want to post a picture of your awesome food, but your phone is about to die. 
Beefsteak has additional locations such as Dupont Circle and Foggy Bottom. And if you are on the run, they have you covered with their app that is easy for ordering food for pick up. 
We cannot recommend that you try this restaurant and these dishes more, so you need to hurry because their menu is subject to change soon.

2018-12-12,AU,India,"Freshmen Nirmala Persaud, left, Sayukta Agarwal, center, and Janvi Sai, right, perform a Bollywood Garba fusion dance at the 2018 annual Jalwa Culture and Fashion Show.
Students clad in vibrant lehengas, saris and kurtas alike filled the Tavern on Oct. 19 for “The Royal Jalwa,” an event hosted by AU’s South Asian Student Association. Students who walked the runway of the event’s fashion show wore colorful garments, jewelry pieces and sequined shawls that represented distinct elements of their culture. 
Janvi Sai, a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences, chose to wear a lehenga decorated with orange, yellow and pink. Sai said a lehenga is an embroidered two-piece outfit, a skirt and a blouse, often complimented by a dupatta, a long scarf. 
“The dupatta for the lehenga was silk. Banarasi silk, I think,” she said. “I was wearing golden ruby jewelry as well. The outfit and the jewelry were both from Hyderabad; it made me nostalgic.”
Sai said she grew up with these clothes. Her mother often designed costumes for her Bharatanatyam performances, an Indian classical dance form based on a Hindi concept called “Natya Shastra.” Dancers would typically wear long, pleated costumes embellished with embroidery.  
For these performances, Sai said she would wear her embroidered costume, paint on her hands, bells on her ankles and jasmine flowers in her hair. Sai’s mother would design intricate costumes through needlework and chose accessories to match. 
“When it comes to haute couture, South Asian clothing may not come to people’s minds,” Sai said. “My mother’s designs changed the game and fueled my fascination for South Asian clothing.”
Syeda Siddiqi, a junior in the School of International Service, wore a sari to Jalwa. A sari is considered traditional Indian dress, made up of long pieces of cloth and fabric. Wanting to make her outfit a bit sultry, she chose a red and black garment and gold jewelry pieces to match. She said that these events and these clothes are some of the ways she maintains connection with her culture. 
The sari can be traced back to Tamil poetry, which described women in elegant gowns and wraps. It eventually made its way to North and South Indian fashion. There are many legends about the creation of the sari. 
One suggests that a weaver daydreamed about a beautiful woman while using his loom. Due to his absent minded daydreams, he kept using his loom until he realized that the garment had become yards long.
A kurta is a long garment worn usually by men, while women typically wear kurtis. Kurtas and kurtis are worn throughout South Asia, in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Nepal, just to name a few. The main discrepancy between the two is based on the length of the garment. Kurtas and kurtis can vary  in length, typically near the knees. They can be dressed up or down worn with a churidar, salwar or a more modern pair of jeans. 
A churidar is a trouser that is more tight, similar to leggings. The salwar, on the other hand, is looser and a bit baggy. 
Sai wore a tikka to the event, a headpiece made of gemstones such as ruby or gold. Maang tikkas are used as accessories for brides as well. Hindu mythology writes that this spot on the forehead is a “third eye” resting on the sixth chakra, which holds power of concentration and emotion. However, tikkas are now becoming an accessory that is worn at many events to evoke fashionability or elegance. 
Sai said that South Asian fashion represents the diversity that exists in the wide region. With the many subcultures, peoples and languages in South Asia, Sai said, comes various styles and forms of clothing. She said that the lehenga she wore to perform with her dance group could be considered more North Indian. 
“I also wore a lehenga because I’m fascinated by South Asian history and how lehengas date back to the Mughal era,” Sai said. “I find South Asian clothing to be a reflection of our history and heritage.”
Nostalgia often occurs for Sai during these events. The clothing frequently reminds her of her memories in India and the city of Hyderabad. Sai said she then grew up in a primarily-white town that did not offer many opportunities for this kind of expression. 
“I’m appreciative of the experiences that I’ve had with South Asian culture at AU because I didn’t really have that back home. I had to make it for myself. I was really among the only people of color or even South Asians in my high school in my town,” Sai said. “I was always constantly being told by peers and teachers, that they wanted me to assimilate, and it was kind of this problem that they had with me. But no, I'm going to embrace what's different about me and my culture.”
Students say that AU is not exempt from this type of South Asian erasure. In October, a group entitled Viva Kultura visited Kay Spiritual Life Center for a show about “Hinduism and Indian culture.” Many students were upset by Viva Kultura’s inclusion of several non-South Asian dancers in their performance. 
Maya Krishnan, the president of the South Asian Student Association, published an opinion piece in The Eagle shortly after the event criticizing the group and the University for allowing them on campus.
“AU does not have a large South Asian population, and there is minimal representation of South Asian culture in academia and coursework, even within curriculum of courses hosted in the School of International Service,” Krishnan wrote. “With such little representation, whatever exposure there is needs to be accurate.” 
Siddiqi said that events such as Jalwa are integral for herself and other students at AU, as there are not many opportunities to celebrate South Asian culture through fashion, music and dance.
“It’s important that we refuse South Asian invisibility on campus,” she said. “It reminds us that our culture is important.”

2019-10-09,AU,India,"American University is a leader in the field of international service. The nationally-ranked program is sought after by many students and offers a plethora of unique opportunities that anyone interested in the subject would be lucky to have access to. Still, as ahead of the curve as AU loves to emphasize that it is, significant work is yet to be done on how our students learn about countries other than their own. 
As a CLEG major, my interactions with SIS are limited to getting work done at the Dav and one or two required classes that fit under the discipline of international service. Still, after taking one of those courses, it is clear to me that the way we teach and talk about non-Western nations is condescending and a disservice to the regions in question. 
Students of color, like myself, are in a unique position to bring something new to the discussion of other nations. My background specifically gives me a comprehensive understanding of how India works beyond what’s on paper, and allows me to juxtapose that with my upbringing in the United States. It is an incredible resource to have, especially when it comes time to study that region specifically. Still, my experience with that aspect of the course was overwhelmingly negative. 
Sitting in a room that’s almost entirely full of white people, I can understand the impulse to not pick words carefully. However, any adverse suggestions, no matter how well-veiled, nuanced or unintentional, are destructive. Any off-hand implication that another country might be primitive and somehow wrong in their politics is incredibly reckless. These implications grow to be established attitudes students have towards other regions in the world, attitudes that are born of mindless and mostly negative nuance. 
Our perspective of the rest of the world is ingrained in our upbringing, and even as educated adults, it is hard to separate a deeply developed perspective from objectivity. This results in people familiar with the Western experience treating the governments of other nations as primitive, uneducated and sometimes even wrong. I don’t doubt that this treatment is unconscious, but that is even more of a reason to diversify the body of individuals that teach  students about incredibly complicated region-specific issues. 
Diversity is a constant goal to strive towards in any institution; however, it is essential in international studies. In order to accurately communicate the nuances involved in the study of other nations, how they interact with each other and how that affects our own, academia needs diversity. Yes, it is a difficult task to create a faculty made up of members of the nations they teach, but it is crucial to the authentic representation of the politics and cultures of these nations. Politics is not just what’s written in the governing documents of countries; it is the everyday application of those documents, something that can only be fully understood by experiencing it. 
The notion that other nations are wrong and ours is right is dangerous, no matter how casually it is implied. This attitude sends students out into the world thinking they have the tools to save nations and create a Western, one size fits all solution to a region-specific problem. Irrespective of whether the nation is developing or developed, teaching from the baseline of America’s “correctness” is endlessly harmful and taints the noble endeavor of studying to be an international servant.

2020-05-03,AU,India,"Students from AU for Warren sell merchandise on campus to promote her presidential campaign.
While phone banking and canvassing are traditional ways to show your support for a presidential candidate during the primary season, AU student organizations showed that simply sporting a button on your backpack or wearing a t-shirt with your candidate of choice is enough to make a statement.
Student groups on campus have devoted themselves to advocating for specific candidates during the primaries, using merchandise to increase awareness for certain candidates.
Alex Russo is the president of AU for Warren, a student organization that paid for their merchandise entirely out of their own pockets. AU did not provide funding for this merchandise because the organization was deemed as too “short-lived,” according to Russo.
Russo said AU for Warren has about 250 people on its email list, and about 20 or 30 members he could rely on for assistance.
Despite the suspension of Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign in March, the organization has remained active on social media.
AU for Warren wrote in one tweet, “While Elizabeth Warren has suspended her campaign, it does not suspend the truth in her fight.”
Other student groups, such as AU College Democrats, did not endorse specific candidates as an organization. However, Vice President of AU Dems Emily Coneybeare was proudly wearing Elizabeth Warren merchandise across campus. She has a “NH for Warren” sticker on the center of her laptop and a Warren button on her backpack. Coneybeare worked for Warren in New Hampshire, and said that being able to wear merchandise from the campaign has a sentimental value for her.
“To be able to carry on what I know is such a good campaign and to represent it at school and wherever I go is important to me,” Coneybeare said.
Even though Warren suspended her campaign, Coneybeare does not necessarily have plans to stop wearing Warren merchandise. Coneybeare said her Warren merchandise reminds her of the people she met and the formative experiences she had while working on the campaign. 
AU Dems have been continuously using their online platform during the coronavirus pandemic by providing students with resources and advocacy ideas. The club is promoting COVID-19 related material and is selecting students for scholarships.
Christian Omoruyi is the president of AU Students for Biden. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, candidate-focused groups have had to brainstorm new ways to keep students involved. 


“Now with coronavirus and all the mayhem that has unleashed, we are definitely looking at virtual ways to keep our momentum going,” Omoruyi said.
Even before Bernie Sanders officially suspended his campaign, Joe Biden had been gaining more traction in the race. Omoruyi said that, across AU for Biden’s communications networks, the club has a wide following.
Since the pandemic caused many AU for Biden members to return to their hometowns, Omoruyi explained that he is “strategizing on future primaries” and encouraging members to raise awareness for Biden in their local communities. He is especially interested in having students spread the word in Pennsylvania and his home state of Indiana. 
Before the spring 2020 semester was moved online, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, AU for Biden did not have merchandise created.
Nonetheless, Omoruyi said he’s proud of the logo that AU for Biden designed. He said these logos will be used on future merchandise, including buttons. He is working on “light-hearted” t-shirt designs appealing to Biden’s interests in aviator glasses and ice cream.
AU for Biden will most likely sell this merchandise during the fall 2020 semester, since shipping to students across the country would not be financially feasible for the small student club.
Both Russo and Omoruyi agreed that merchandise is beneficial for supporting candidates in the presidential primaries.
“When people see something familiar, like a familiar logo, I guess there’s just something subconscious that just kicks in,” Omoruyi said, adding later, “I think merchandise can also create a sense of solidarity when people are all wearing merchandise together.”
“We are a community of laptop stickers and buttons on our backpacks, and when people see that, just like walking down the quad, that tells them, ‘Oh wait, there’s a community on campus,’” Russo said.

2020-09-09,AU,India,"Alumna Mia Van Allen founded Color of Music Collective to amplify people of color and LGBTQ individuals in the music industry.
At the start of the Color of Music Collective’s panel “Word of Mouth: The Power of Digital Marketing + Promotion Confirmation,” founder and American University alumna Mia Van Allen asked an important question.
“Digital marketing campaigns can be great ways to display solidarity for social change movements to large audiences,” Van Allen said. “As a marketing professional, how do you ensure that your campaigns and marketing strategies are inclusive, diverse and impactful?”
It’s a question that professionals across the country are asking, but one that Van Allen feels is especially pressing in the music industry, which is why she created the Color of Music Collective (COMC) to amplify the voices of people of color and LGBTQ individuals in the music industry.
As a Black student, Van Allen said that she noticed a lack of representation in the music industry through her studies as a public relations major and business and entertainment minor. At her various internships, Van Allen said that she was often the only person or woman of color in the workspace. 
“I dealt with imposter syndrome, and my way of dealing with that was networking with people of color … and getting their guidance throughout college,” Van Allen said. “It created this sort of mentorship program for myself and I was able to maintain those relationships.”
The connections that Van Allen made at AU gave her the idea to create the COMC. She first went to Emily Yankana, a friend and fellow graduate from AU, to flesh out the idea.
Yankana, who is Filipino and West Indian, said she was also troubled by the lack of representation of people of color and LGBTQ individuals at predominantly white institutions like AU and in the music industry. 
Yankana, who graduated with a public relations degree in 2019, is determined to transfer her skills to advocate for underrepresented communities in the public relations field. She said that one way she can do that is through volunteering on COMC’s social media team.
Van Allen said that Yankana was the one who thought of making a collective of BIPOC and LGBTQ individuals in the music industry through virtual networking. The pair worked on COMC’s brand and name, and Yankana used her background in marketing and advocacy to help bring Van Allen’s ideas to life.
The collective launched in June with a free virtual networking panel featuring LGBTQ and BIPOC human resources representatives from different companies. After its first panel, Van Allen said its email inboxes and direct messages were filled with hopeful volunteers. 
“That whole collaboration part is what makes us really special and what makes our community really special,” Yankana said. “I’m always so ecstatic when we add someone new to the team because it just means that I get to watch them grow and mold them into fitting whatever goals they have to achieve.”
Hana Braverman, a 2020 AU alumna who studied business entertainment with concentrations in music and information technology, said that she joined COMC as a community outreach volunteer because of her interest in the music industry and her own experiences feeling underrepresented.
As someone who identifies as half-Korean and as part of the LGBTQ community, Braverman said it was rare to see someone “like her” in the industry. She emphasized that, in the music industry, there is “blatant racism and misogyny.”
“If you are a marginalized voice and you want to work in the industry, it’s so hard to just cold call or apply online,” Braverman said. “This is a really great way to network and meet people and learn about what to expect and what to know.”
As a community outreach director, Braverman and other volunteers brainstorm panel ideas and research potential panelists to bring into the event. Van Allen said that its panels have hit capacity nearly every time. 
“I like to keep it as diverse as possible — ideally different races and different sexualities and genders each time,” Van Allen said, in reference to the panelists.
While the panels give participants an opportunity to ask questions and listen to BIPOC and LGBTQ voices inside of the industry, the volunteers reap the benefits as well.
“Mia, and the whole group, [are] really keen on making sure these people that are volunteering are making those connections because we’re the ones that are really interested in working, and obviously volunteering,” Braverman said. 
Aside from panels, COMC hosts BIPOC and LGBTQ writers on its blog and provides a comprehensive job board with both paid and unpaid internships and part-time and full-time jobs.
“Essentially the job board is for employers and organizations to reach out to us,” Yankana said. “This is sort of us trying our hand at coordinating that process and extending new opportunities to not just our volunteers, but the wider audience in itself.”
On Aug. 14, the organization hosted “The Listening Room,” a virtual concert featuring BIPOC and LGBTQ artists and the band BAILEN as a headliner. The group raised over $200 for Arts Administrators of Color.
Van Allen and the COMC have big plans lined up. In addition to regular panels, Van Allen has started teaching seminars at universities like New York University about racial discrimination in the music industry.
Van Allen and her team are determined to use their growing platform to create a more accessible entry to the music industry for underrepresented communities. Although they’ve already made a difference to their volunteers and audience members, Yankana said that the collective’s work is a “continuous process” to figure out how to best amplify those voices.
“It’s a tough industry and people won’t tell you secrets,” Braverman said. “But it’s nice having people who are like, ‘I understand your struggle and let’s do this together so we can see the industry in a new way.’”

2020-11-13,AU,India,"Cyrus and Myrtle Katzen Arts Center on Massachusetts Avenue 
Editor's Note: This article appeared in The Eagle's October 2020 virtual print edition.
Before the coronavirus pandemic dominated our lives, people commonly spent a weekend afternoon roaming around an art exhibit. There is much to see and experience for general audiences at an art exhibit, from paintings to installations, sculptures to photographs. 
Museums don’t create themselves, however. The projects are carefully calculated by professionals known as art curators.
Since the AU Museum at Katzen Arts Center opened in 2005, Jack Rasmussen, the museum’s director and curator, has played an important role in how the museum works with the AU community. He said that Katzen was built as a focal point for AU’s campus.
“Our programs were really more directed towards Washington, D.C., and over the past several years, we've been trying to get more and more corporated into the life of the campus, the academic life,” Rasmussen said. 
As a very politically-active university, Rasmussen curates shows that reflect on ideas of identity, social justice and politics. Rasmussen says other museums might be hesitant to show exhibits like this because they court controversy, but the AU community is very receptive and supportive of these debatable shows. 
Though Rasmussen is the only official curator at AU’s museum, he often brings in guest curators to highlight different art experiences. The goal of curators and museums, Rasmussen said, should be to recontextualize history, preserve artwork and change culture.
Jordan Amirkhani, a modern and contemporary art history professorial lecturer, said that art galleries do a good job of “hiding the labor that goes into the construction and organization of an exhibition.” 
“It's supposed to look effortless, and that's because curators are responsible for communicating a very clear visual experience for a viewer, for an audience member, for a museum-goer,” Amirkhani said.
Amirkhani also works as an independent art curator, focusing on living artists, especially female artists of color and female artists in general. She is curating an exhibit for the Atlanta Biennial at the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center, which will debut in February 2021. 
“The word curator comes from the Latin ‘to care,’ and that is something that I think about a lot in my own work, that you are, in a way, a kind of caretaker or steward of artwork and art objects in an art institution,” Amirkhani said. 
Amirkhani and the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center thought they might have to cancel the Altana Biennial. Once they decided not to cancel it, she said it was still difficult to curate the exhibit. Armirkhani used Zoom and FaceTime to see the artists’ pieces that would be in her collection.
“So much of being a curator is being in artists’ studios and seeing work in-person, in real-time,” Amirkhani said. “And, that opportunity was taken [away] from me, and it was really difficult to put together a show with the absence of being able to be in Atlanta.”
Rasmussen also adapted by moving his most recent exhibits online, including the series entitled “Contested Space.” Every presidential election cycle, Rasmussen presents exhibits that address some of the most prominent issues leading up to the election.
Photographer Edward Burtynsky’s “Water,” a series that took five years to complete, features in the exhibit. It captures humans’ relationship with water, including in Canada, Iceland and India.
According to AU’s website, “Water” was previously “curated by Russell Lord, Freeman Family Curator of Photographs, for the New Orleans Museum of Art in 2013.”
“You can get drawn down into just the minute level, and it just holds together all the way down to the almost microscopic. It’s an incredible experience to see these in person,” Rasmussen said about Burtynsky’s series.
Burtynsky echoed Rasmussen’s thoughts about his work, saying the online format is not ideal for viewing his photographs. 
“It's not the experience that you want. You want to stand in front of these prints,” Burtynsky said. “You can go in and put your face six inches away from the picture, and it doesn't fall apart. Everything that is still there, it's readable as information.”
Both Rasmussen and Amirkhani are adjusting to these different times while engaging with topics on identity and contested issues leading up to the election. 
“It has to be relevant to what's going on in the world,” Rasmussen said. “Sometimes, that's the job of the curator for the museum is to provide the context in which you can understand what you're seeing in terms of today.”

2021-04-10,AU,India,"Nikki Randhawa and Simrnjit Seerha met outside their freshmen dorm halls in their first year at American University. Seerha dropped her One Card and Randhawa picked it up for her. They began talking and found out they shared a cultural and religious identity; they are both part of the small Sikh student population at AU. 
Now, as seniors, they are the president and vice president, respectively, of one of AU’s newest clubs: the Sikh Student Association.
Randhawa and Seerha see SSA as a space for Sikh students to feel less isolated and alone on AU’s campus and a place where they can connect with other people of similar backgrounds, experiences and values.
“I think even having a group of three to four people makes all the more difference, because you know that when you get together with this group, there's a sense of shared identity,” Seerha said. “And that is so helpful, especially when you're going to a predominantly white school.""
SSA became an official club last spring, but its roots go back further. 
Deep Kaur, an alumna of AU who is returning to pursue her master’s in international relations, was a vital part of SSA’s beginnings. As a Sikh student at AU, Kaur missed being surrounded by people who shared her same religious and cultural identity. 
Kaur said that former President Donald Trump’s election in 2016 was a crucial time for her as an undergraduate student. It made her realize the importance of having a community to turn to in a time of such confusion and chaos. 
“That was a moment where I was like we really need to have an SSA,” Kaur said. “We need to have these open spaces and places where, as students, we can talk about what's bothering us, how are we being affected and also just [talk] about things in general that happen at AU.”
At predominantly white institutions like AU, it can be hard for students of color to find their community without a designated organization. Clubs like SSA that create a community based around shared cultural experiences and religious beliefs can make the transition into college and away from family less isolating for students, Kaur said.
""When you live away from home, it can be kind of tough to find your group of people,” Kaur said. “Especially for people who might be... not so used to being in a crowd where there’s more non-Indian people or more Caucasian people rather than people of their own community.""
Kaur began hosting weekly meetings in the library to gather AU’s small Sikh population and talk about their culture and religion. The meetings were based around a structured program developed by an SSA at a university in California that facilitated discussions about Sikhi and specific issues Sikh students face on campus. 
The goal of the program was to help Sikh students eventually create their own official SSA. As sophomores, Randhawa and Seerha attended some of these weekly meetings.
Kaur graduated from AU in December 2018 with a bachelor’s degree in political science, before SSA became an official club. She said that, as a graduate student, she would “definitely love” to connect with AU’s SSA.
“I really am excited for them to continue this work and I really hope I get to be a part of it,” Kaur said. 
This semester, SSA is hosting weekly virtual Gurbani Veechar on Wednesdays at 3 p.m. where they discuss interpretations of the Kirtan Sohila, a group of sacred texts written by three Sikh Gurus, over Zoom. They also co-hosted an event with the South Asian Student Association on March 4 called the Farmers Protest Teach-In, which included discussions about the history and the current day issues related to farmers’ protests in India.
As of right now, SSA is small — most meetings are attended by the four members of the executive board and one or two other people — but Randhawa said that she is not focusing too much on the numbers right now. She said she is just proud that they were able to get the club up and running, to begin with, and she hopes that its existence allows Sikh students to feel less isolated at AU.
“What I would hope for in the long run is that Sikh students on campus aren't alienated or isolated, where they can fully have a space to practice our religion and learn more about our religion and the rich history that comes from it,” Randhawa said.
Seerha said that the diversity of South Asian culture calls for more focused groups where students can analyze and talk about their identities in more depth.
“India itself has thousands and thousands of cultures, and each culture is so specific,” Seerha said. “That’s why not only having a SASA is wonderful, but, on top of that, having the Sikh Student Association, where your identity is even more magnified so you can really critically analyze it and understand it.”
Randhawa said that being the president of SSA has involved her learning more about Sikhi and Sikh history on her own. Coming from a Catholic school, she said she knew more about Christianity than she did about Sikhi. And, even now, she said she is still learning about Sikhi every day.
“Coming to Sikhi was actually very comforting and I'm glad that I had that experience of not being able to know much about my cultural-religious identity to now having a good handle of it and how it influences my life currently,” Randhawa said
Seerha said that SSA has been academically stimulating for her as well. AU doesn't offer as much of a variety of courses about South Asia, so Seerha’s work in getting ready for the weekly Gurbani Veechar and events such as the teach-in has been “academically fulfilling,” she said.
Seerha and Randhawa said that their main goal for SSA and a tradition they hope carries on in SSA after they both graduate in May, is engagement with activism. This started with the teach-in with SASA, and they are looking to do more because Sikhi is known for being radical, advocating for human dignity and challenging unjust traditions, they said.
“Sikhi is just rooted inherently in activism and fighting against oppression, injustice,” Randhawa said “I hope that future members of SSA can also focus on that as well because I feel like it's part of our praxis as Sikhs to do so.”

2022-04-12,AU,India,"As American University's coronavirus protocols slimmed this semester, so did the guidelines for clubs. On-campus organizations have taken advantage of the less restrictive guidelines, which lifted food restrictions, made the events timeline request process more flexible and allowed for external guests.
School of Public Affairs and College of Arts and Sciences senior Daniel Cohen is the finance director of AU Club Council and keeps records of the allocation of money to different clubs. Cohen said that the guidelines last semester looked a little different due to the fall 2021 health and safety guidelines released by the University, but as the University’s guidelines changed so did AUCC’s. 
“With the food guidelines, there's no longer a restriction on the food type or serving style,” Cohen said. “Last semester due to COVID we required that clubs had pre-packaged food just because they had to abide by those guidelines put in place by the university.”
CAS senior Shahad Mohieldin is the chair for AUCC and oversees the club consultants and makes sure there is communication between them and their respective clubs. Mohieldin said that last semester, there was a guideline where if an event required food, then it would be considered a “complex event” which meant that clubs would have to put in a budget request five weeks before their event for it to be approved by AUCC. Now due to the updated food guidelines, clubs can put in a request for food three weeks before the event. 
“One of the reasons why we changed this is because of updated guidelines, but we also wanted it to be easier on clubs for them to plan out their events effectively and make sure their food was available, and we realized last semester working with clubs that having a five-week deadline for food complicated things,” Mohieldin said.
The third guideline included inviting external camps for events. Clubs could bring in guests starting from Feb. 15 once they have completed the AU COVID-19 attestation form which confirms proof of vaccination. 
Recently, the Black Student Union took advantage of the new food guideline to plan an immersive cultural catered experience. 
On Feb. 22, BSU hosted an event called “Taste of the Tropics” during Founders Week, which was co-sponsored by AU Caribbean Circle and Student Government.
Zari Scott, a School of Communication junior and the personal relations deputy director for BSU, said that the event was a more enriching experience because they were able to serve food. Students were able to explore the entire diaspora that is the Caribbean trying foods from different countries. 
“My family is from the Caribbean,” Scott said. “Both my parents were born and raised there, so it's just always nice to get to teach people about your culture in a way that doesn't necessarily feel like you're teaching.”
Scott said she thinks that the guidelines issued this semester will really help get freshmen more engaged and bring back that sense of community that upperclassmen experienced before the pandemic. 
Nanaama Idun, a sophomore in CAS, attended the Love of the Diaspora cultural event March 27 as a part of a joint effort from BSU and the AU NAACP. Food was provided at this event for those who attended. 
“The Love of Diaspora event was meant to recognize and celebrate the diaspora that makes up the Black community,” Idun said. “And food — like many cultures in the world — is a huge part of the culture, since the diaspora is so expansive.”
Idun said that the event was a success and helped bring the AU Black community closer together thanks to the less strict guidelines surrounding food from AUCC.
“Food brings communities together, no matter where you're from or what you like to eat. Food is a pillar of what you think about unity,” Idun said. “That’s why the Love of Diaspora event helped bring us all together and celebrate the food that has ties to who we all are.”
Looking ahead, the AU Bhangra Crew is hosting an event on April 15 called the AU Bhangra Bash. A DJ, catered food and performances will be provided free for AU students to attend with valid AU ID and a vaccination card. 
Ajuni Takkar, a CAS junior and choreographer for AU Bhangra CREW, helped plan this event as a part of the e-board. 
“When it comes to cultural events, it is especially important to have food to share a piece of your heritage with others,” Takkar said. “We look forward to bringing catered food from Cafe of India in Tenleytown, so the updated AUCC guidelines this semester have allowed us to also support a local Indian-owned business.”
Takkar said that the club experienced an increase in involvement, which is why it was important for e-board to host an event to boost inclusivity and interest for the fast-growing club. 
“The new guidelines are an improvement, so it’s nice to be able to look at Cafe of India’s menu and not worry about food being individually wrapped,” Takkar said. “We were less focused on food restrictions when preparing for this event and so we avoided spending time on a potential added layer of restriction.” 
Takkar said they put in a lot of effort to organize the event, so hopefully providing food will increase attendance at the upcoming bash. 
“Overall, we are really trying to increase our presence on campus because other nearby schools have a huge Bhangra club,” Takkar said. “We’ve tried to grow and diversify our organization, so having a local cafe cater our event will help with engagement and spread more awareness about the existence of the AU Bhangra Crew.” 
Scott also mentioned how the new regulations will help encourage community building and engagement with clubs as things were before the virtual switch due to the pandemic. 
“I think these new sanctions … bring back that pre-COVID atmosphere that I know a lot of the upperclassmen had,” Scott said. “That's been my whole goal, to give the younger students the opportunities that I know I had and enjoyed and were the reasons why I chose to stay at AU.

2022-09-01,AU,India,"""My Beloveds"" by Storme Webber
Brutal colonialist practices and white supremacy have suppressed the culture and relationship of Black and Indigenous communities for centuries, leaving many members from younger generations disconnected from their mother tongue, lineage and dual identity. 
To strengthen kinship and acknowledge Black and Indigenous identities, the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) “Ancestors Know Who We Are” exhibit affirms how Western standards of isolating identities can’t diminish or silence the unified and outspoken connection of the Black-Indigenous community.  
Anya Montiel, curator of the exhibit, brought together the works of six Black-Indigenous women artists who reflect various aspects of intersectionality, the harms of patriarchal oppression and standards and the solidarity between Black and Indigenous communities as they fight for collective liberation. 
The exhibit features artwork from various mediums and includes essays from Black-Indigenous scholars and activists reflecting on topics such as art in relation to gender and identity and Black and Native Futurity — the need to reclaim stolen land and prevent alienation from one’s culture to secure a future for Black and Indigenous communities. 
“In the United States, we often discuss Black and Native peoples as separate groups and peripheral to white people,” said Fariza Nzinga, a teacher-scholar in residence at the Bell Hooks Institute at Berea College. “This narrow framing ignores shared histories, erases blended families, keeps relatives isolated and alienated from one another and falls into the trap of centering the white experience.” 
Moira Pernambuco, one of the artists featured, has illustrated Black and Native academic theory through her photography series ""Black Boy Beautiful, Black Boy Vulnerable,” depicting the harmful effects of white patriarchal standards on Black-Indigenous men. 
""Troy"" by Moira Pernambuco

In the photograph “Troy,” a man is depicted leisurely sleeping on a bed with his arms crossed over his eyes, displaying a peaceful vulnerability. As a result of targeted police violence and harsh standards for masculinity, putting one’s guard down can be dangerous and life-threatening for Black men. 
Kyle T. Mays, an Afro-Indigenous writer and scholar, reflects on this photograph and relates it to his personal experience: “Looking at the photograph of ‘Troy,’ I am reminded of being told as a young boy that ‘sleep is the cousin of death’... Seldom do we tell Black men to rest and relax, to proactively take care of our bodies and minds. ‘Troy’ reminds us that the act of self-care is, in truth, a masculine act and necessary to the path of resistance.” 
Pernambuco’s photos resist patriarchal standards created by white supremacy and seek to document the history of Black-Indigenous people, since their history has been destroyed by colonizers. Pernambuco said in an interview with the NMAI how she doesn’t know who her African ancestors are and therefore asserts the existence of Black-Indigenous people through her art. 
The artwork of Pernambuco and others displays the importance and necessity of unity across communities to fight for social justice and liberation from white supremacy. “Ancestors Know Who We Are” shows how although history has been erased and stolen from Black-Indigenous people, creators have used art to dismantle Western definitions and hierarchies of race while also celebrating their multiple identities.

2022-11-07,AU,India,"Resilience is something the Washington Wizards Head Coach Wes Unseld Jr. is seeing from his team this year. 
On Oct. 20 at Capital One Arena, some hopeful words were shared from both players and coaches as practice was wrapping up.
“Basketball is about learning. We learn from a mistake and try our best not to repeat it,” said Unseld, who has now begun his second year as the head coach of the District's NBA team. 
It is always a good sign when the practice right after a win is focused on fixing mistakes, but it is an even better sign when the best player is on the same page.
“There is a lot we can do better and there is always room for improvement,” said Bradley Beal, who is now a 10-year veteran for the Wizards.
The team started regular season play at Indianapolis on Oct. 19 with a seven-point win over the Indiana Pacers (3-4). Every win comes from a recipe, and sometimes, the recipe can be quite simple.
“It’s all about how we start and finish quarters,” Unseld said. “We want to put our players in the areas of the floor in which they can excel and be resilient.” 
One of these players seems to be Daniel Gafford. 
“For me, it’s about being at the right place at the right time and just playing smart,'' said the 6-foot-10-inch forward center. 
When asked about his defensive approach, Gafford simply answered with: “Moving my feet, not reaching and not getting mentally fatigued.”
In the NBA world, the Wizards seem to always find themselves in the underdog position and are usually overlooked by other squads. But on Oct. 20, there was an energy in the air, the type that encourages players to be more focused, locked-in and bought in. 
Beal may have said it best:
“At the end of the day, we are pros like everyone else. We can’t worry about other peoples’ opinions. We are a young team and have the opportunity to grow, as long as we stay poised and don’t get rattled.”
The very next day, the Wizard's 4th quarter performance brought them a 102-100 victory over the Chicago Bulls (5-4) in their home opener. Maybe this year the Wizards’ key ingredients will just come down to resilience, moving their feet and poise.

2022-11-09,AU,India,"The American University South Asian Student Association (SASA) hosted its annual cultural event, Jalwa, on Nov. 5 at the Washington College of Law, bringing together students and alumni for a night of talent and fun. The night was themed “Lights, Camera, Action,” complete with movie posters and film decor, setting the stage for a lineup of performers.
From dances and songs to a fashion show showcasing traditional South Asian attire, there was something for everyone in the audience to enjoy and applaud. The full house audience was buzzing with anticipation to see the performances.
“We’re here to offer the stage to people in the community to show off their talents – and of course, dress up and eat good food,” said Vishwa Bhatt, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences and co-emcee for the night along with Sriman Thangaraj, a sophomore in the School of Public Affairs. 
Students in SASA who participated in Jalwa are from different parts of the South Asian Diaspora, including Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and the Maldives, said Bhatt and Thangaraj in their opening remarks. The event was open to SASA alumni and other AU community members who wanted to partake in celebrating South Asian culture.
“I think the food stands out, and I think that’s a big part of why non-Brown people or non-Asian people come, which is good. I think the music is also why,” said SPA sophomore Anusha Mathur, a member of SASA and performer in the fashion show portion of Jalwa.  
Jalwa began with buffet-style food from Spice-6 catering, which according to the restaurant’s Instagram, is “a fast-casual take on Indian cuisine.” 
The night also hosted a diverse group of student performers. The first performance was AU Agni — the first premier fusion dance team on campus — followed by Chaytanya Kumar, who showcased a rap performance. K-District, AU’s K-pop dance team, danced to three songs at the event, and SASA’s co-president Darshi Ambani performed a solo dance. A duet in Tamil, the native language of parts of southern India and Sri Lanka, was performed by Tejasvi Hariharan and Arpitha Sistla. Meera Swaminathan, a member of AU Agni, also performed a solo dance to a Tamil song. 


The final singer of the night was Kruttika Gopal accompanied by Hanish Immanuel, who sang an emotional ballad. To round out the performances, American Bhangra Crew — which is open to Punjabi and non-Punjabi students — kept the energy high with a dance that got the entire crowd cheering. 
Students within SASA also got the opportunity to show off their traditional South Asian attire in a fashion show. The crowd cheered on participants as they walked in pairs across the stage to a song of their choice.
Jalwa concluded with an open dance floor where attendees were able to come together and dance to a combination of South Asian and American music. 
Each group and performer at the Jalwa celebration put hard work into ensuring the diverse talents would educate event attendees on South Asian culture and provide a positive, fun experience. 
“I had a lot of fun at Jalwa, and felt a strong sense of community tonight,” said Mahita Dasu, a sophomore in the School of Communication.

2022-11-09,AU,India,"I'm reporting for the life section about the intersection between consumer aesthetics, climate change, and low government action for climate change. 
Artistic interpretations of Yellow Stone’s geysers, Zion’s canyons, monarch butterflies and magic mushrooms have exploded onto the rack in big-name stores while climate disaster worsens and 58 percent of Americans believe policymakers aren’t doing enough.
Parks Project is the nonprofit arm of the National Parks Service (NPS), sustainably creating and producing fashion to preserve underfunded national parks. The project was joined by big-name outdoor brands such as REI, Pendleton and L.L. Bean to increase NPS profit.
Outside of the Parks Project, corporations such as Target are increasing consumer attention toward environmental aesthetics by launching mycology-themed and “Save the Earth” clothing lines.
John Paul Mejia, a junior in the College of Arts and Sciences and national spokesperson for Sunrise Movement, said this trend demonstrates a degree of environmental awareness and an aesthetic appreciation that is intrinsic to humanity.
“Those of us at the bottom of the economic ladder or have neighborhoods that are slashed by the inequalities of race and class have differing accessibility to nature,” Mejia said. “I think that fashion and a yearn for nature speaks to some of that inaccessibility.”
The biodiversity within nature has inspired fashion for centuries: from European textiles to Islamic geometric patterns and Indigenous American tapestries, each conveys earthly reverence. Trending vintage illustrations of nature harken to a hopeful time without the looming presence of climate change.
“Being able to imagine and articulate a future that is good is something that’s sometimes hard to do,” Mejia said. “That requires a lot of labor, a lot of hope and the absence of cynicism. Those things are hard to do when all you see is bad days all around.”
Trendsetting and statement pieces come with caveats. In the process of bringing designer looks to the public, fast fashion companies break labor rights and cause extreme environmental degradation. 
Meanwhile, sustainable fashion negates environmental impact but is often too expensive for the average consumer. The average cost for a Parks Project t-shirt or tank top is $31.97, and REI charges an average of $42.00 for a Parks Project item.
Michael Taffe, a junior in CAS, saw an Instagram advertisement for the Parks Project in 2020 and has been wearing their gear since. He said he loves the retro design and feels the purpose is worth the price.
“It makes me feel a little bit better about it because I know it’s going to a good cause,” Taffe said.
Alongside preserving parklands, Taffe believes businesses using parkland imagery should acknowledge the lives and homes stolen to build national parks.
“I think the Indigenous story needs to be told,” Taffe said. “Reparations should be part of these brands if they truly want to be equitable.”
Few Americans are aware of the national parks’ brutal history. To mold American landscapes into untouched wilderness, the Federal Government authorized the displacement of its Indigenous inhabitants. Without cruelty, illustrations of the undiscovered wild would not be present for marketing.
In September 2022, NPS partnered with American Indian and Alaska Native Tribes, Alaska Natives entities and the Native Hawaiian Community for future national parkland management.
Molly Stites, president of Wonk Trade, a student-run trading and exchange post at AU, and a third year in the School of Communication, said too many Americans romanticize national parks as the paradigm of sustainability.
“I love national parks, but there are many other levels of sustainability and environmental justice that people should be focusing on,” Stites said. “It’s really important to dig deeper into that and open your eyes up to thrifting.”
Scrolling through Parks Project apparel and searching the racks of REI, the wandering eye is drawn to retro screen presses of parklands and scientific sketches of the natural world. New and recycled interpretations of the Earth stand in sharp contrast to the everyday images of climate disaster.
While these illustrations provide nostalgia for a time without the eclipsing presence of climate change, recognizing the origins of the land motivates climate action.
“This nostalgia,” Mejia said, “Whether it is aesthetic or political, helps us imagine different moments in which social movements and artists and other folks who have employed their political and artistic agency have reshaped the country.”

2022-12-09,AU,India,"To uplift Indigenous artists and highlight stories about Indigenity from their perspective, the National Museum of the American Indian hosted its annual Native Cinema Showcase from Nov. 18 to Nov. 25. 
Future Focused Shorts
This compilation of short films highlighted animated and kid-friendly stories focused on the future generations of Indigenous communities. 
“Evan’s Drum,” directed by Ossie Michelin, is a heartwarming story that follows Amy Winters as she tries to teach her son Evan the lost Inuit practice of drumming. Winters leads a drumming troupe in Labrador City, near the Quebec border, which has shrunk in membership from 18 to five in the preceding years. The film depicts endearing scenes of Winters and her son making a drum and illustrates how family bonds are strengthened through the sharing of traditions. The short concludes with a powerful shot of Winters and her son playing their new drums on a serene beach, showing their gratitude for nature by offering the gift of music in return. 
While some films highlighted how generational knowledge is being revived, others depicted the reality of Indigenous people trying to teach the meaning behind their art to others outside of their culture. “Mis Manos Tejedoras,” directed by Río Castañeda, focuses on a Mayan artist weaving huipils, or woven shirts, to sell in a touristy town square. The film’s sparing use of dialogue allows its colorful animation and intimate portrayal of the artistic process to speak for itself. Idyllic images of the artist creating a beautiful piece are starkly contrasted with reality when a tourist doesn’t purchase the huipil when the artist won’t bargain for a lower price. 
Twisted Tales
This series of shorts depicts reimagined traditional Indigenous stories and satire, documenting rituals and cultural commentary through a unique lens. “Nalujuk Night,” directed by Jennie Williams, portrays a Labrador Inuit New Year’s tradition in which men dress up as Nalujuit, representations of heathen spirits, and knock on people’s doors to determine who has been good that year. If children have misbehaved, they are chased through the snow by the menacing figures dressed in animal bone and fur. The film exaggerates the chase scenes, editing them with intense traditional throat singing and thriller-like editing to poke fun at the children’s reactions to the Nalujuit. 
These twisted tales also make comedic jabs at modern issues such as white guilt and cultural appropriation. In the short “My First Native American Boyfriend,” directed by Joey Clift, Emily, a white woman, confesses to her first Native boyfriend Johnny every microaggression she’s ever made, including dressing up as Pocahontas when she was five and calling Rihanna her spirit animal when she was in junior high. Emily also asks Johnny if he's a werewolf like the ones in “Twilight.” Johnny begins to get annoyed, but Emily later reveals that she asked that question because she is a werewolf and morphs into one, resulting in Johnny breaking up with her. The blatant microaggressions and impertinence from Emily satirically displays the consequences of white people thinking that Native people are obligated to alleviate their guilt. 
“Portraits From A Fire”
This enticing and emotional film directed by Trevor Mack follows a 16-year-old boy named Tyler who loves to make movies and put on shows for his community. Upset by his distant father who won’t support his art, Tyler confides in a teenager named Aaron who convinces Tyler to make a movie about his deceased mother. The movie shifts between reality and Tyler’s visions of his mother, interrupted by alarming glitches in the screen in which his mother physically appears for seconds at a time. Ending in a heart-wrenching reconciliation with his father, “Portraits from a Fire” powerfully depicts love and loneliness from a teenager’s perspective. 
Imagining the Indian  
“Imagining the Indian,” directed by Aviva Kempner and Ben West, is a documentary-style feature tracing the fight to abolish Indigenous mascots and unpacking the effects of non-Indigenous people’s perceptions of Native Americans. 
The documentary unpacks the symbolism of Indigenous mascots in sports, from how football is a territorial game to the origin of the word mascot from the Spanish word “mascota,” which translates to “pet.” The occupational range of Indigenous people interviewed includes poets, curators, musicians, athletes, professors, actors and activists, and is a testament to how the fight against Native mascots is interdisciplinary and has negative implications for fields besides sports. 
In one poignant scene, Suzan Shown Harjo, an author, activist and scholar of Cheyenne/Hodulgee Muscogee descent, says of ending mascotting, “You’re trying not just to end the disdainful imagery, but eliminate what has taken the place of you in other people's eyes and the reason they can’t see you as a human being”. 
From informational documentaries to comedic shorts to moving features, the 2022 Native Cinema Showcase showed the importance of consuming art created by Indigenous people and the power of art to dismantle stereotypes and monoliths.

2022-12-12,AU,India,"""Marabar"" under construction in early November
From the Newsstands: This story appeared in The Eagle's November 2022 print edition. You can find the digital version here. 
In 1981, artist Elyn Zimmerman was commissioned by the National Geographic Society to design a sculpture for the plaza of its D.C. headquarters. More than three decades later, Zimmerman returned to what she thought would be the permanent site to re-imagine her million-pound piece before i is moved nearly four miles to American University’s campus.
Zimmerman coordinated her installation with architect David Childs, who led the earlier renovation of the Society’s headquarters. Zimmerman said it was especially unusual for a relatively young, female artist to be chosen for such a large-scale project.
“I didn’t realize that the piece would become as popular as it was and that it would lead, for me, to a lot of other commissions,” Zimmerman said. 
The extent of the sculpture's popularity became evident after its continued existence was threatened. In 2019, National Geographic filed for approval to renovate the plaza of its headquarters. The plans included a new main entry pavilion and a rentable rooftop garden, but no “Marabar.”
Dismantling the purportedly permanent artwork generated significant backlash from the broader artistic community. Museum leaders, architects and art critics sent dozens of complaint letters express- ing their desire that “Marabar” be preserved.
“It made me feel valued and that the work was valued by people who had experience in the art world or architecture,” Zimmerman said.
Public outrage culminated in an organized cam- paign to save the piece, launched by the Cultural Landscape Foundation.
“I was very grateful to the Cultural Landscape Foundation,” Zimmerman said. “They reached out to me and they said ‘Can we help you,’ and I didn’t know how to approach getting this situation remedied.”
National Geographic eventually agreed not todismantle “Marabar'' — committing rather to fund its removal, transportation and installation some- where else. The Society considered Canal Park, lo- cated approximately a block away from the Navy Yard metro station. However, Zimmerman did not think the expansive park landscape was conducive to her piece. 
“It was just a big open space, and it didn’t have any context,” Zimmerman said. 
After visiting various potential properties, Zimmerman chose a spot across the street from the Katzen Arts Center, where the structure will be visible from Ward Circle. Zimmerman said Canal Park was so open that it felt vulnerable, whereas the smaller and tree-lined site on AU’s campus offered some protection.
In its original iteration, “Marabar” consisted of fractured granite boulders surrounding the perimeter of a 60-foot rectangular reflecting pool. Three of the boulders had polished faces mirroring each other, giving the impression that they were once a single monolithic form. Zimmerman compared her design to geodes — rock structures lined with minerals that are often cut open and polished.
The name “Marabar” originates from fictional caves in E.M. Forster’s “A Passage to India.” Zimmerman said Forster’s description of the caves stuck with her and reminded her of real-world caves she saw during her own visit to India. It was seeing these intricate chambers carved out of solid rock that first inspired Zimmerman to sculpt.
“You discover something, and it sort of sets you off,” Zimmerman said. “I feel like I went to India, I was a painter — I came out of there and all I wanted to do was make stone sculpture.”
“Marabar’s” boulders have already been removed from the plaza at the National Geographic Society. There were safety concerns, both for the relatively fragile polished stones and for whoever was tasked with moving the piece, but Zimmerman said the removal went off brilliantly and referred to the people who performed it as heroes.
Returning to the project after nearly four decades is bittersweet, Zimmerman said. Given its site-specific nature, certain elements of the sculpture’s design will be reconfigured to fit the new location. “Marabar” will be renamed to reflect the changes.
The adapted structure will be titled “Sudama,” after one of the elaborate Indian caves that inspired Forster’s fictionalization. “Sudama” not only pays homage to the original name, but relates to Zim- merman’s own artistic journey.
""The reason I started working with rock and with granite in particular was that I had gone to India in 1976, spent four months there and I visited a number of these sites,” Zimmerman said.
Construction is underway across from Katzen Arts Center to prepare the site for the “Sudama” installation. The installation and landscaping is anticipated to be completed no later than spring 2023, according to University spokesperson Jasmine Pelaez.
“I was very nervous about something possibly going wrong ... things being damaged,” Zimmer- man said. “But I see that the people that are engaged, working on it are very capable and everybody wants the same positive experience at the end.”

2023-02-07,AU,India,"When notorious Communications, Legal Institutions, Economics, and Government major Sam Siegal raised his hand for the third time in GOVT-110, freshman Cora Burke could barely contain her excitement. She sat up straighter and listened intently, mentally rehearsing how she would relay whatever off-topic drivel he was about to disgorge later to her roommate. Maybe it would be something inconsequential about a founding father or a long-winded story that inexplicably brought up his dad’s boat. Maybe she would even get lucky, and he would somehow slip a reference to bitcoin into the discussion about the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. 
Before she could run through the complete list of possibilities, tragedy struck; Sam made a creatively engaging comment that was relevant to the required reading without inserting any unwarranted, extraneous commentary. 
“I couldn’t believe my ears,” teaching assistant Lauren Meany said. “He didn’t even correct former U.N. Ambassador professor Skelton’s response despite the fact that she’s a certified woman.”  
Much to his classmates and professor’s surprise, Siegal quietly took notes for the rest of the lecture. That’s right: he didn’t ask any follow-up questions that had no correlation to the original question, and he abstained from checking Elon Musk’s Twitter account for the entire 23 minutes left in class. 
News of this development has taken American University by storm, with many students calling into question all they held dear. Although the notorious CLEG major denied The Seagle’s request for an interview on the grounds that he doesn’t want anything messing with his 2040 presidential campaign, his roommate Phillip Levin was convinced otherwise after an offer of one warm cookie from Subway.  
“I don’t really care about what Sam did in his gov class.” Levin said, midway through the aforementioned cookie. “But could someone please tell him to refill the Brita?”  
Regardless of whether Sam ever refills that Brita, he did redefine – even if only for one shining minute – the abilities of a male CLEG major. 
Editor’s Note: Sam Siegal was recently named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year for groundbreaking developments in humanity. He is on the shortlist for a Presidential Medal of Freedom and is rumored to be the frontrunner.

2023-02-08,AU,India,"Maddy Park choked back tears, her voice mixed with sadness and anger, as she spoke passionately about her grandmother during a student-led candlelight vigil for the victims of the Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay shootings Feb. 1.
The senior in the School of Public Affairs and the advocacy and outreach coordinator of the Korean Student Association spoke about how her grandmother explored Manhattan, New York in her adulthood and now avoids doing so, fearing for her well-being. 
“It pains me to see how limited my independent grandma has become due to a lack of safety and immense fear our community is suffering from,” Park said. 
Park’s voice then swelled. 
“Our communities do not feel safe, our elders do not feel safe, we do not feel safe, but we deserve to feel safe,” Park said.
The event, hosted by Project Pengyou and the Korean and Hindu Student Associations, was a space for the American University community to gather, process and heal as well as remember the victims of gun violence from the Monterey Park and Half Moon Bay shootings. 
On Jan. 21, a gunman opened fire at Star Ballroom Dance Studio in Monterey Park, California, killing 11 and injuring nine. Two days later, another mass shooting occurred in Half Moon Bay, California, which left seven dead and one critically injured. The victims of the shootings were of Asian and Latino descent and occurred during Lunar New Year, a holiday celebrated by many Asian cultures. 
The vigil at the Woods Brown Amphitheater started with the event organizers –– Park from AU’s Korean Student Association, Vera Tsang from AU Project Pengyou and Divya Chhotani from the Hindu Students Association –– introducing themselves, followed by a two-minute moment of silence to honor the victims. After the organizers spoke, they opened the floor to any of the nearly 100 attendees who wished to share. 
The Asian American Student Union posted a statement on Instagram following the California shootings. 
“These tragedies, among many others, have made it clear that Asian American and Pacific Islander struggles in the U.S. have been ignored for far too long –– that our collective pain, generational trauma, our grief, our humanity, has been set aside and brushed under the rug by the insidious fabric of institutional racism,” the post read. “It is not radical to claim the right to live in safety and peace. It is not radical to want a better life for family and kin, to immigrate and reside in this country, or to continue to enjoy a rich culture filled with affinity and community. It is not radical to be visible and it is not radical to want to be alive.” 
AASU executive board members called for the University administration to stand up and speak out with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. 
Chyna Brodie, Student Government president and a senior in SPA, emphasized the sentiment of cross-community solidarity as hate crimes continue to occur, such as the recent killing of Tyre Nichols, a Black man who was beaten to death by police officers in Memphis, Tennessee. 
“It’s beyond important to have cross-community solidarity at American University because our community is multi-dimensional and it encompasses a lot of different communities,” she told The Eagle. “At the end of the day, you can say you support a lot of different communities, but if you’re not showing up for them, then it really doesn’t matter.”
While the vigil provided a space for AU students to heal, some of the event coordinators said organizing the vigil caused them an immense emotional burden.
Chhotani, a junior in the College and Arts and Sciences, said putting together the vigil “took away” from the fact that the event organizers were students and that the Asian American and Pacific Islander community was grieving. 
“It’s very stressful that it’s on the AAPI community at the school to take initiative when it shouldn’t even have to be us, and other communities on this campus should be stepping up just as much as we would step up for them in times of need,” she said.
Park said she, Chhotani and Tsang planned the vigil because there wasn’t a space in D.C. for the AU community to process what happened. 
The University sent an announcement to students from California regarding the shootings on Jan. 23, but did not send out campus-wide communication.
On Jan. 25, President Sylvia Burwell sent out an email about the work AU is doing against “hate and bias incidents in society,” specifically antisemitism. Burwell wrote that AU’s investigation on the swastika graffiti found in Anderson Hall last September was closing. The email did not mention anything regarding the California shootings. 
Elizabeth Deal, the assistant vice president for community and internal communication, wrote in an email to The Eagle that the shootings were “tragic.” She stated that “the Office of Campus Life reached out to AU students who come from the surrounding communities to offer support and resources.” 
Regarding the administration’s response to the shooting, Deal wrote that there are multiple factors the University considered before sending out campus-wide communications. 
The University considers questions like “whether the incident occurred on our campus or in the broader D.C. community, if it involves higher education matters or took place on another college campus, or did it directly affect large segments of the AU community, among other areas,” Deal wrote.
While Park acknowledged that other minority communities should be elevated and uplifted, she was shocked that something wasn’t “circulating around what had happened over Lunar New Years.” Because of this, Park said she felt unrepresented and unheard by the administration.
Tsang is the director of education, culture and advocacy for Project Pengyou and deputy of advocacy and outreach for the Korean Student Association. She represented Project Pengyou at the vigil. 
Tsang added the University ignoring Asian American and Pacific Islander issues was “distasteful” on Burwell’s part and that the AU administration had done “an awful job at addressing anything related to AAPI hate.” 
Tsang also mentioned how the University “didn’t do anything” in response to the attack in Aug. 2021 on Sean Lai, a gay and Chinese Georgetown University alumnus, by an AU graduate student in the Kogod School of Business. The AU student was expelled two months later. 
Park said the University released a statement regarding the March 2021 Atlanta spa shootings, but it took more than three days to do so while the Asian American and Pacific Islander community was “severely upset and distraught and disheartened.”
Chhotani also drew attention to how the University has historically responded to anti-Asian threats. Chhotani said the 2021 farmers’ protests caused violence to escalate among different ethnic groups and Hindu communities in the United States. In 2022, Chhotani said there was a “drastic rise of crimes against the Indian community” and no response from the University acknowledging that Indians belong in the Asian American Pacific Islander community. 
Kelly Ma, a sophomore in the School of Communication and president of AASU, was among the 10 speakers at the vigil. In her speech, Ma said she felt “dejected,” but not surprised about the administration’s silence. Ma echoed Park, Tsang and Chhotani’s points and criticized the University for putting the burden on leaders of student organizations to address instances of hate.
“Although we may all feel a sense of hopelessness, anger and sadness, I hope that we can raise our voices in unity to protect our community that we have,” Ma said. “And I hope that we can do justice for the lives that were lost in violence.”
Tsang spoke about being prideful of her Chinese heritage and culture in her speech and because of her deep love for her customs and identity, it was especially difficult to see the recent rise in anti-Asian violence. Tsang said that Lunar New Year, a holiday celebrated in Chinese culture, was “filled with mourning instead of celebration.” Tsang also called out anti-Asian rhetoric surrounding the shooting, the term “Asian-on-Asian crime” and also honored recent hate crime victims of East Asian descent. 
“Everything that’s been happening, all these attacks, these shootings, these deaths, they break my heart,” Tsang said. “To see people like me, people like my friends, like my family get attacked. It breaks my heart.”
Chhotani’s speech, which she called “Being Brown is My Superpower,” detailed her struggles with her racial identity as a child. Chhotani said that as she got older, she slowly began to love and appreciate her identity as an Indian woman. 
“Little me would never imagine how powerful being brown actually is,” she said. In her speech, Chhotani honored murder victims of Indian descent in the United States and demanded justice for them.
Both Tsang and Chhotani ended their speeches by asking the AU community to advocate and stand with the Asian American Pacific Islander community.
Meera Swaminathan, a junior in CAS who spoke at the event, said she was infuriated that the University administration had not made an official statement or helped plan the vigil. 
“But, I think the organizers did a beautiful job,” Swaminathan said. “I’m glad that we have students that care so much to make up for the administration’s lack of support.”
Students struggling with their mental health and the California shootings can reach out to these services on and off campus for additional support:

2023-05-05,AU,India,"From the Newsstands: This story appeared in The Eagle's April 2023 print edition. You can find the digital version here. 
The following piece is satire and should not be misconstrued for actual reporting. Any resemblance to a student, staff or faculty member is coincidental.
As wonks across American University’s campus are suffering from stress ulcers in the wake of finals, many look to the greener pastures of summer break for a glimmer of hope. The Office of Campus Engagement recently conducted a survey in an attempt to gauge which factors excite AU students the most about the upcoming break and remind us all of the light at the end of the tunnel. Here are the top seven activities AU students are most excited to do come May 10, most of which were a surprise to precisely no one:    
1. Referring to D.C. as “the city” in their hick hometown. This answer was reported by 28 percent of students.     
My brother in Christ, let's stop pretending Joe Biden is your neighbor; you live in Tenleytown. You are closer to Wegmans than the red line.      
2. Paying under $15 for a shot. This answer was reported by 22 percent of seniors.  
Sure, the bar will have an autographed picture of Rudy Giuliani and only play country/pop sung by neck-bearded tenors, but nothing tastes better than cheap feels! Fair warning, though, some bars will not allow every wandering, babyfaced 19-year-old to slip through the doors, so use that awful fake sparingly. Not every bar values your dollar over their liquor license.  
3. Name-dropping Congress members they briefly interacted with during their Hillternship. This answer was reported by 17 percent of students.    
Cory Booker made eye contact with you at Union Station because you had mustard on your chin, not because you’re the next AOC. Also, the most you’ve ever done to advance your pro-worker agenda was mute the constituent ten minutes into his thirty minute rant about how your moderate democratic state representative is a pawn for ANTIFA.    
4. Cheating on their Georgetown situationship with their hometown situationship. This was reported by 12 percent of students.      
A real Edward versus Jacob moment.      
5. Complaining about their internship. This answer was reported by 9 percent of students.      
What’s more fun than complaining about the classes you’re voluntarily paying a small fortune to take? Complaining about the internship acceptance you literally prayed for! After a grueling nine months of complaining about classes, complaining about an internship will be a breath of fresh air.      
6. Eating a “real” bagel. This answer was reported by 8 percent of students.  
As much as it pains the Seagle to acknowledge the so-called “state” of New Jersey, the people have spoken: there is nothing more important to them than the gluten product they have chosen to define them as a people. This answer wasn’t even a survey option, either. Those watered-down “Italians” abused our “other” section like their terrible fake tans abuse our eyes. 
7. Mansplaining the election for Speaker of the House. This answer was reported by 4 percent of students.      
Our SPA-iest of Eagles are salivating at the mouth to explain to every innocent home friend or unsuspecting younger sibling the historical significance of Kevin McCarthy’s humiliating speaker election. While this event will be months old by the time summer comes around, everyone knows explaining political events aren’t about educating anyone: it’s about that sublime feeling of superiority. And the best part? You don’t even have to be a man to engage in mansplaining. As long as your attitude is pretentious enough, you’re golden.   
Whether your parents are paying for your overpriced apartment in the city or you’re loitering around suburban America and working your part-time high school job: best of luck on your finals and, of course, HAGS.
