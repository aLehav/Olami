Have you ever considered where graduate students were living this semester? How about the number of graduate students actually dorming? Jennifer Fuoco, the director of residence life, has informed the Pioneer that there are currently 92 graduate students living on campus and that the total number of graduate students living on campus has changed over the years. Fuoco added that, “This number has changed from year to year and is currently up by six from last year at this time.”
Various factors can determine why most graduate students choose to live off-campus.  Sean Manning, a graduate student studying medical microbiology said that “since [he] lives near the school, he doesn’t see the point in living on campus.” Jessica Blumenthal, a graduate student studying social work, agreed with Manning. Blumenthal said that she doesn’t live on campus because she “lives 30 minutes from the school, so for me, it is not worth paying for housing on campus when I can live at home for free.” Although their reasons seem plausible, living on campus can also have its advantages.
Blumenthal went on to say,  “During my undergrad., I was in Maryland and paid for housing, both in dorms and in an apartment, so I already had the experience of living somewhere else.”
The director of residence life also provided a tentative explanation as to why graduate students choose to live on campus. Fuoco said, “living on campus seems to appeal most to graduate students who are enrolling in graduate coursework immediately after finishing their Bachelor’s degrees.  For students who have been out of the residence halls and away from campus life for a year or more, the idea of living in a residence hall, having a roommate, and sharing a community bathroom may no longer be something that works with their lifestyles or schedules.  Some graduate students are also completing their coursework while working full-time and may choose to live closer to their workplace.”
Though living off-campus may be suitable for someone seeking a different experience of being in another environment that is more private and confined, few graduate students agree that living on campus can be an advantage. A graduate student, who wished to remain anonymous, said that when “you live on campus, [you] meet a lot of people and don’t have to deal with all the traffic of commuting, and you get more involved with school related activities. And, living on campus also allows you to work.”
As you can see, there are many things that can influence a person’s choice in deciding whether to dorm or not.  One can agree that graduate students, although one may  think there are none on campus, do make up a significant percentage of the student population on campus. If you still unsure about whom the graduate students are, try networking through the residence halls; you bound to come across a graduate student more quickly than you would think.

C.W. Post students were able to express their Post pride with a Pep Rally on Friday, October 21st, at 7 p.m. in the gym of the Pratt Recreation Center. Sponsored by The Association for Campus Planning (ACP), the Pep Rally had a number of events for students to enjoy.
The night included the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners of the talent show giving an encore of their winning performances. Homecoming banners were proudly displayed, clubs were acknowledged, and the Student Dance Association and Pioneerettes dazzled the crowd with their own performances. And, last but not least, students showed their Post pride to the football team before the big homecoming game. What’s not to love about pep rally?
In addition to the performances, there were also free food and drinks offered to the crowd, along with some green and gold pompoms and foam fingers to cheer with. And, ACP didn’t stop there. It also threw free C.W. Post t-shirts into the crowd and had a D.J. blasting music throughout the event to keep the students pumped up.
Sally-Ann Gaughan, a junior early childhood education major, was surprised by this year’s pep rally. “It was better than I thought it would be. It had more school spirit. It was just awesome.”
Anna Smith, a freshman with an undeclared major, also enjoyed pep rally, saying, “I liked it and thought it was really good. The music was also really good, too.”
This year’s Pep Rally did just what it set out to do: get students pumped up for the big Homecoming game, and allow them to let loose and have some fun.

Conversations Helping and Teaching Stu¬dents, C.H.A.T.S., a program created in 2009, is in the process of becoming an official club at LIU Post. In C.H.A.T.S., an American student and an international student are paired as partners so the two can learn about each other’s cultures and become friends. This gives the internationals students the opportunity to improve and practice their English. 
The offices of International Student Services and Religious Life created C.H.A.T.S. in 2009 and act as co-sponsors for the organization. This semester, C.H.A.T.S. has begun the process of becoming an official club by creating an executive board and attending three Student Government Association meetings. The new executive board consists of five students: Alize Margulis, Rika Tatsukawa, Arti Jain, Terry Chang and Serena Oditt, who will attend the Student Government Association meetings to represent C.H.A.T.S. Father Ted, who is in charge of the Newman Catholic Club, and Jeanette Murray, who works at International Students Services, advise the students. Three coordinators oversee the organization Murray, as well as Trica Figuero and Dr. Leslie Bai. 
“Make another friend; you always need a friend,” said Figuero. C.H.A.T.S. was created to try to build up the connection between international and Americans students. It also serves to improve international students’ command of the English language, allow international students to learn more about American culture, and permit American students to learn about different cultures. This may lead to inviting their partner home for Thanksgiving, and even visiting their partner’s country, said Bai. “International students feel intimidated and lonely. If they find someone who knows American life, they can meet through C.H.A.T.S. first and then become friends later on their own,” said Bai. 
All the C.H.A.T.S. partners are the same gender and are partners for one year. The partners usually meet once a week for about an hour. When, where, what you do and for how long you meet are entirely up to you and your partner. There are also monthly group events for everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. One of the first events this semester was International Friendship Night, which was held on September 20 in the Chapel. The event consisted of games, dancing, food and international trivia. The next event is a presentation on exploring New York on October 11 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. There is an Inter¬national Education Week Dinner planned for November 12 at 7 in the Tilles Center and a farewell party on December 6 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. “The events are open to everyone. We are always encouraging and welcoming visitors and new members, if interested,” said Bai. 
There is an application form which helps with the pairing process. Students fill out their major, hobbies and if they have a preference of what type partner they would like, said Bai. She said last fall there were 50 pairs, last spring there were 39 pairs, and there are currently 27 pairs. However, students join throughout the semester. Students, faculty and staff are all members of C.H.A.T.S. The staff members who are involved in C.H.A.T.S. are Trica Figuero, Dr. Leslie Bai, Jeanette Murray and Nadia Hernandez, who all work at International Students Services. 
“The biggest headache now is there are always more international students then American students,” said Bai. Many international students are waiting for a partner. Bai said new international students are their first priority but returning international students are also waiting. There is a lack of male American students. Many American students are needed and males are needed the most right now, said Figuero. “We have included staff members, and some domestic students take two partners,” said Figuero, to try to solve the problem of not having enough American members. “We try to recruit students at (club) fairs, but it is always hard to get them to commit,” said Bai. 
Bai said many show interest in C.H.A.T.S. while they are recruiting but then they say they are too busy. “Some people are afraid of the commitment; time is an issue,” said Figuero. The coordinators say the group meeting and weekly partner meetings are not mandatory. The events are held so that everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. can get together and do some sort of activity. As long as you are spending individual time with your partner, you do not have to attend the events. C.H.A.T.S. is extremely flexible. “It’s not something to be fearful of or stress out about; just try it” said Figuero. They said they want more American students to learn from this experience. “You don’t have to do something extra; you can bring your partner to something you go to already,” said Bai. 
Being a member of C.H.A.T.S., and acquiring knowledge about another culture, will enhance your resume and work experience as well, said Figuero. Clubs can also pick up partners. Every club on campus has to do a certain amount of hours of community service and earn points for it. If you are on another club on campus and need to earn community service points, you can earn them by joining C.H.A.T.S. If there are a few partners per club, they will give you about half of the points needed. “Internationalization, we want more students to open up, even make our campus a little different,” said Figuero. 
Rika Tatsukawa, a senior Public Relations major from Japan, has been a member of C.H.A.T.S. since September 2011. Tatsukawa was partners with Arti Jain, a junior English Education major, last year. The partners are continuing to work together through C.H.A.T.S. this year as well. “At first, I didn’t expect her to be such a good friend and now I can’t image campus life without her,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she meets, texts and messages her partner often. “I meet Arti at her house a lot, her mother makes Indian food which I love,” said Tatsukawa. She said she went to her C.H.A.T.S. partner’s house for Thanksgiving, her birthday and Christmas. She also said she has met most of her family. “Now I don’t think of her as a partner; I just think of her as one of my friends,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she and Arti have similar feelings to be kind to others and common sense. 
Taksukawa said that C.H.A.T.S. has made her more compassionate to others, especially foreigners. “If I go back to Japan and see foreigners, I want to take care of them and help them because now I know how they feel. Taksukawa thinks that American and inter¬national students can learn a lot from each other. “I wish American students can learn from International students. In the future, it can help them with their work if they know that culture,” said Taksukawa. She said she taught her partner how to say hello in Japanese, “Konnichiwa,” and thank you, “Arigato.” 
Alize Margulis, a junior International Studies major has been part of C.H.A.T.S. since she was a freshman. “I joined C.H.A.T.S. because I thought it was the best way to learn about other cultures and customs,” said Margulis. Her first C.H.A.T.S. partner was Winny Wang, a graduate student from China studying Science Research. She said she found similarities between Wang’s culture and her own. “Winny almost always boils water and drinks the water as such; whereas I would boil water but I would drink it only if I had diffused a tea bag,” said Marguilis.
Last year, Marguilis and her former partner, Kotona Uzumaki, a Business major from Japan, were C.H.A.T.S ambassadors. “We spoke at various C.H.A.T.S. events and were nominated and received certification for Outstanding C.H.A.T.S. Partners of the Year 2012,” said Marguilis. She said her past two partners have become her really close friends. “Kotona, who was studying abroad in the U.S. for one year was in two of my classes , and once we became C.H.A.T.S. partners, we went to various club events on campus and explored off campus too,” said Marguilis. She said she feels she taught her partner how to be comfortable in her home when inviting her over for holidays and dinner. Marguilis said her two past partners taught her many phrases in Chinese and Japanese. She said she and Uzumaki would see shows in the city and at the Tilles Center as well as spend time in her neighborhood. Marguilis still keeps in contact both of her C.H.A.T.S. partners through Skype and e-mail. “I’m hoping to travel to Asia one day, so I know I will be able to explore their countries with them too!” she said.
This year Marguilis is partnered with a student from China named Shuai Shuai, but she has not met her yet. She said she wishes more American students joined C.H.A.T.S. “LIU Post provides this opportunity through the C.H.A.T.S. program, but I feel not enough domestic students are committed or interested in becoming a partner. I understand many students have busy agendas, but how complicated is it to take one hour per week out of your time to meet with some one?” said Marguilis.
She said she has truly enjoyed her experience as a member of C.H.A.T.S. “Inter¬national friends have certain values that we as Americans don’t. I am not bashing Americans, but we should embrace other cultures and be open to learning about them, especially in this globalized business world that we live in today,” said Marguilis.

LIU Post was offered a special opportunity to display President Lincoln’s only surviving handwritten draft of the emancipation Proclamation in the Tilles Center of Performing Arts at the “First Step to Freedom: Abraham Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation” exhibit. The final version of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863, was destroyed in a fire in Chicago in 1871. The draft is the only remaining copy, which led to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom of slaves. The New York State Legislature purchased the draft in 1865 days after Lincoln passed away.
LIU Post is the only Long Island exhibitor of this rare document while it goes on a state-wide tour to mark the 150thanniversary of one of the nation’s greatest accomplishments. LIU Post and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts are pleased and honored to join with the New York State Education Department and SUNY College of Old Westbury in presenting these national treasures to the community,» said Dr. Paul Forestell. Along with Lincoln’s draft, a speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the centennial anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation is also on display next to the draft. 
Students who have seen the historical document expressed their admiration for it. “I think it’s great we we’re able to see a part of history in the Tilles Center,” says Mitch Mark, senior Psychology major. “It’s almost like reliving a part of history and it’s really special.” Matt Aronberg, an Information Studies graduate student says, “It’s amazing how a piece of paper was able to change so much of our history and to make our country the way it is now.”
At the opening ceremony held in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall during Common Hour, Dr. Forestell, Dr. Steinberg, Dr. John B. King, Jr., Andrew P. Jackson and Robert Tilles reminded visitors that freedom and equality hasn’t been reached yet. Robert Tilles explains to those in attendance the segregation on Long Island. “We have pockets of poverty. We drove along the road between the high and low performing [school] districts, and you see people across the street here look at people across the street there saying, ‘how come they get the best education and how come we get the worst education?’”
Both historical documents were on display for the public with free admission on October 15 and 16 from1 pm to 9 pm. The exhibit was offered in partnership with LIU Post, LIU Votes and the Tilles Center of Performing Arts.

	Hurricane Sandy and the nor’easter that followed caused LIU Post to close for a total of 11 days, including weekends. In order for students to complete their fall 2012 courses in full satisfaction with the New York State Education Department requirements, missed classes will have to be made up, according to Beth Carson, who works in Registrar. 
	New York State mandates a specific amount of contact (instruction) hours, explains Carson. For a three credit course, there must be 2,250 minutes of contact hours not including out of class work.
	The rest of the fall semester’s academic calendar has been revised as well. Make-up classes for the hurricane will be scheduled on Fridays, Saturdays and during common hour. It will be up to the professor to determine which days and times will be used. Wednesday, December 12, will be a mandatory make-up day for classes. 
	Classes that were cancelled due to the nor’easter will be made up as follows: evening classes cancelled Wednesday, November 7, will be made up on Saturday, December 15. Classes that were cancelled on Thursday, November 8 (2pm and later), will be made up on Thursday, December 13. Classes that were cancelled on Friday, November 9, will be made up on Friday, December 14. Faculty will be responsible to confirm all make-up sessions, times and locations with their students.  
	Final exams will now be held from Monday, December 17, until Friday, December 21. 
	The extra classes have been reported to add stress on some students. Jacob Maitland, junior business major, said, “I’ve had two rescheduled classes and one that really did me in.” Because of some scheduling issues, his parents are visiting him the week after Thanksgiving instead of during the break. His law class was rescheduled for a Saturday when his parents would be visiting. He said he reacted with “a lot of beeps, hash tags and stars.” The class is also expecting an exam that day. Maitland said that it was too personal to reveal his professor’s name; however, the professor allowed him to reschedule the exam for a later date so he could spend the extra time with his parents. 
	“Students should speak with faculty regarding any conflicts that they have with scheduled make-up classes,” Carson said. She added that if there are additional concerns made by the student that cannot be resolved by the faculty then they should speak with their chairperson or dean. 
Some students understand the need to make-up classes. “It was a whole entire week of classes, that’s a lot of days missed,” said Joe Nicastro, junior criminal justice major. He added that it’s better than extending the semester. 
	Natalie Post, freshman finance business major, said, “Mine didn’t bother me, but if I had a Friday class, I might be mad.” She normally works during common hour and did not mind missing one day of work but still referred to it as money coming out of her pocket. 
Softball players Kaci Hopkins and Nicole Hagenan, both criminal justice majors, were relieved that they did not have any rescheduled classes that interfered with practice. Their Earth Science class was rescheduled for common hour. “I’d rather have it at common hour because people have jobs and practices to go to,” Hopkins said.
Other universities fulfilled their missed days differently. St. Joseph’s College eliminated finals week to have more classes and Stony Brook University professors were just told to consolidate the course material and added no make-up days. 
“We can’t speak to how other colleges are choosing to fulfill their contact hour obligations. Additionally, not all Long Island colleges were closed for the same lengthy period that LIU Post was due to the consecutive storms,” said Carson.

With rumors of major changes coming to LIU Post within the next six months, the semester’s first Town Hall meeting, held by the Student Government Association (SGA), was a necessity, both to dispel and clarify all the speculations.
The Town Hall meeting on Wednesday, Nov. 13, was an open forum, which allowed Dr. Jackie Nealon, the university’s new chief of Staff; Dr. Abby Van Vlerah, the new dean of Students; and Alerie Tirsch, the director of Student Life, to answer questions from attending students about a wide range of topics, such as campus life and the rumored changes.
There have already been some big changes since the new President, Dr. Kimberly R. Cline, took charge of LIU on July 1, including the opening of a new student run clothing store and the restructuring of certain administrative areas of the school, including Admissions and Academic Advisement.
On the subject of rumors, Nealon quickly squashed the question that a Shake Shack was coming to the campus.
There has also been an overwhelming worry around campus that tuition would be raised, which could mean added financial strain for many students. However, Nealon stated that Cline has promised no more than a two percent increase in tuition until 2020, compared to the average of over six percent.
The Apple Store that is rumored to be opening in Hillwood is not going to be an Apple store. However, it will be a tech store that is licensed to sell Apple products, a rare affiliation that only a few academic institutions can claim to have, stated Nealon.
This tech store is also going to have a tech support bar, something students can take advantage of if they are having any kind
of computer problems. The Student Art Gallery is will be possibly used as a shared space, perhaps with another student run business similar to the clothing store. The Center for Student Information (CSI) is going to be used for another purpose, possibly another student run business, but no plans are set in stone as yet, which means no more printing in CSI, something that could raise concern among commuter students who use CSI for their printing needs.
“I often use the printing facility in CSI as a quick option as I am passing through Hillwood on my way to class. I hope that there will be an alternative printing facility that is convenient,” said Andreas Olsen, a graduate Political Science major and commuter student, who attended the Town Hall meeting.
With the Gaming Room already moved to the upstairs study lounge, there was worry among students that
the Recreational room, also located upstairs in Hillwood, would be made into something else, therefore diminishing the amount of study space in Hillwood. However, Nealon assured students that there are plans to revamp the Recreational room, making it a better facility for students.
“There is already limited space for commuters to study during common hour; allocating space for this seems essential for a commuter school, ” said Kristina Renberg, a senior Public Relations major and commuter student.
An interesting discussion of proposed student run businesses for Hillwood was also held. One hundred percent of the profits from these businesses, according to Nealon, will go straight back to the students, with 50 percent going to scholarships and 50 percent to the school’s capital fund, which will be spent on other improvements for students.
For the students who live on campus, a hot topic at the Town Hall meeting was the Winnick Dining Hall, and the major question was, “Will the food change and get any better?” Van Vlerah said, “Paul Carroll, the director of operations for Aramark FoodSservices, is willing to work with students to cater to their needs. We encourage students to take to resources like the SGA food committee to help communicate what it is they want.”
Brianna Pisano, a freshman and member of SGA, who attended the meeting stated, “Dr. Nealon often reassured the students of their worries by explaining that they want to expand access to study resources and entertainment all around campus rather than just in Hillwood.”
The Town Hall meeting, which was held in the Cinema during common hour, didn’t have a large attendance. However, for students it was an interesting and necessary meeting that began to bring clarification on a range of topics.

As The Pioneer reported on Sept. 30, the LIU Post equestrian team set out to complete a daunting mission—raise enough money to rescue a slaughter- bound miniature horse, and make him the team mascot. The team held a bake sale during common hour in Hillwood Commons, posted flyers throughout campus seeking donations, and even created a web page on gofundme.com so that others could donate money to pay for the purchase and future expenses of the miniature horse.
After a lot of hard work and dedication, the girls were finally financially able to travel to the horse auction located in New Holland, Pennsylvania and choose which lucky horse would be coming home with them for another chance at life as their team mascot.
The mission took place on Oct. 13. Hope, a sweet palomino mare, caught the riders’ attention right away. Two of the three team captains, Cristina Bakos, a senior Speech Pathology/Pre-Med major, and Alex Diez, a junior Biology major, as well as one of the fundraisers, Christina Cepeda, a junior Psychology major, brought the mini horse to her new home in Bakos’ backyard barn in Nesconset, where she will have a much more exciting life with the other mini horses—and a donkey—already living there.
All of the money raised by the team will be put towards the many expenses needed to properly care for any horse, including veterinary and farrier appointments (hoof trimming), board, feed, wormer, shavings, and clothing. Hope had a warm welcome to the LIU Post equestrian team when she made her mascot debut at the annual Homecoming Football Game on Saturday, Oct. 18. For such a tiny equine, Hope handled the loud, crazy football game quite well. She tried her best to not get too overwhelmed.
“She was calm at homecoming, but would sometimes get startled with sudden, loud noises like popping balloons or the loud music, but eventually she got accustomed to the all the noise,” said team member Colleen Dreyer, a senior Public Relations major and the team’s Treasurer.
The day at homecoming was a success, which even included raising more money to care for Hope in the future. The equestrian team raised $1,110 through their “Go Fund Me” account, which is linked on the team’s Facebook page. To donate money to help Hope, you can go to www.gofundme.com/save- a-pony, or email christina.kotarski@my.liu.edu or christina.cepeda@my.liu.edu.
The next on-campus horse show at the North Shore Equestrian Center will be on Nov. 9, at 8 a.m. Hope, the mini mascot, will be there to show support. The event is open to the public.

Halloween is only days away, and with all the excitement, you may have forgotten to get a killer costume, or make plans with your friends. Each year trends change and different costumes become popular, new haunted houses open along with different parties that attract people.
There are several events being held in the New York City to celebrate Halloween. This year’s events include:
Webster Hell
Attend the Halloween Parade “After Party,” hosted by Webster Hall; all four floors of Webster Hall, with guest appearances by Suga Ray, Sean Sharp, and more. There will be a “Virgin Sacrifice,” on an unsuspecting guest, and a costume contest with a prize of $5,000 dollars. Tickets are available on Webster Hall’s website.
Candle Light Ghost Tours of Manhattans Most Haunted House
Take a 50-minute tour of the Merchant’s House in Manhattan.
This tour reveals the “dark past” of the Merchant family, and how they’re still “haunting” their house years later. The Merchant’s House is located on 29th East 4th Street between Bowery and Lafayette Street. This tour is available on Mondays and Thursdays through Sundays, from noon to 5 p.m. until Oct. 30.
Village Halloween Parade
Roughly 50,000 people take to the streets in a parade displaying their creative costumes. The parade is open to anyone interested in attending, but anyone who would like to walk in the parade must be in costume and makeup. The Halloween Parade runs up Sixth Avenue to 16th Street in Manhattan, from 7 to 11 p.m. on Oct. 31.
Dogs Parade
For those who missed the dog parade in the city on Oct. 24, it will be happening again on Oct. 31 in Tompskins Square Park at 12 p.m. Dress your fluffy friend up, or go see how everyone else dressed up their dogs.
Halloween Adult Scavenger Hunt
Who says scavenger hunts are just for kids? Starting at Slattery’s Midtown Pub, located on 8 East 36th Street in the city, this scavenger hunt starts at 7 p.m. and lasts until 10 p.m. Tickets are $25. Winners will receive tickets to Shake Rattle and Roll, The Big Quiz Thing, Quiet Clubbing, and more.
Crypt Tour
Take a tour of the crypt at The Catherdral Church of St. John the Divine. The tour is available on Oct. 31, from 4 to 5 p.m., for ages 12 and up. Tickets are $20 with a student ID.
Dia De Los Terribles
Experience “Day of the Dead” rituals, photo galleries, live music, and — if you’re legal — an open tequila bar at the Wythe Hotel. The part will be taking place on Oct. 31, starting at 8 p.m. and lasting until 2 a.m. Tickets are $20.
Magic

Two of the five deans of the schools and colleges on campus are interim, acting deans. One was appointed earlier this year and the other was appointed last week. Only one of the five deans has been in place for more than a year.
On Oct. 6, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane, sent a campus-wide email stating Dr. Albert Inserra, the former president of Dowling College, has been appointed dean of the college of education, information and technology. Inserra replaces Louisa Kramer-Vida, who was the acting dean of the college of education, information and technology.
Vida-Kramer is the chairperson of the department of special education as well as an assistant professor in the department. She was approached to take the position of acting dean in mid-June 2016, and began the position on Jul. 1. Kramer replaced Dr. Barbara Garii, the former dean of the college of education, information and technology, who became the vice president for academic affairs of St. Joseph’s College on Jul. 18.
As the Pioneer reported in its Oct. 5 issue, Jeffrey Belnap, the dean of LIU Global, has been appointed the acting dean of the college of liberal arts, succeeding chemistry Professor Nicholas Ramer, who was the acting dean of the college from June 2015 to August 2016. Ramer replaced former Dean Katherine Hill-Miller, who stepped down from the position in 2015 and returned to her position as a professor in the English department.
Art therapy professor, Christine Kerr, became the acting dean of the college of art, communications and design on Sept. 1, succeeding Noel Zahler, who left the University in August.
Stacey Gopack, who was the acting dean of the School of Health Professions last year, is the newly appointed permanent dean of that school.
Only Robert Valli, the dean of the College of Management, has been in his position since 2015.
Some students have expressed confusion and frustration about the coming and going of the deans. Senior economics major Marvin Johnson has had positive experiences with going to deans for help throughout his academic career. Johnson feels that with many of the deans stepping down and the administration constantly needing to find new replacements, many students may begin to feel lost. “Some students have a unique bond with certain deans and by them switching up and resigning, it just makes the students feel not wanted,” Johnson said. “It’s like a puppy with a new owner.”

Former United States President, Bill Clinton spoke to a sold out audience at the Tilles Center on Thursday, Oct. 5.
The event, hosted by former U.S. Congressman Steve Israel and the LIU Global Institute, featured Clinton speaking for nearly an hour on topics including global issues, his wife’s presidential campaign, and the current White House administration.
The event then switched over to the Q & A session with Israel, focused on a number of important topics making news headlines today, such as gun violence, college debt, North Korea, and immigration.
Throughout the night, Clinton spoke about embracing our differences as Americans and working together. Our goal should be “to build more inclusive prosperity, more inclusive societies…and more inclusive politics,” Clinton said.
“In this age, you can build all the walls you want; we are still interconnected,” Clinton said. He stressed that it’s what brings people together that’s more important than the things that divide us.
Abraham Orenstein, a senior broadcasting major was one of the few LIU Post students who attended the event. He was impressed with the speech, although he described himself as a Sanders supporter. “I thought it was a really strong speech that focused on embracing our differences and coming together,” Orenstein said.
Clinton also spoke about the Electoral College which ultimately put Donald Trump in the presidency, although Hillary Clinton won popular vote. “Since I believe in democracy, I believe the person who gets the most votes should win,” he said.
The audience applauded when Clinton spoke about college affordability. “We should do whatever we can to have the maximum amount of people graduate debt-free,” he said, adding that our goal should be for every student from a non-rich family to get out of college without any debt.
On the topic of North Korea, Clinton said that North Korea’s Dictator, Kim Jong Un, has “done and said enough to be of grave concern.” However, Clinton admitted that he didn’t know much more about the current situation than what we read in the news. Clinton did however, caution our current administration, warning that we should know exactly what we are getting into before taking any action. The Trump administration should work with South Korea, China, Japan and Russia on handling North Korea, Clinton said. Israel asked Clinton what international challenge made him “toss and turn the most” during his presidency. “I was always worried about Osama Bin Laden and al- Qaida because he came from a wealthy family and he lived in a cave, which should tell you something – he believed what he was doing,” Clinton said.
Gun control, in light of the recent massacre in Las Vegas, was also discussed. “You do not need this to defend yourself,” Clinton stated about bump stocks, devices which allow semi-automatic weapons to mimic the ring speed of a fully automatic weapon. Clinton recommended “giving the voters the direct voice on this; they trust themselves more than they trust the politicians,” he said.
Michael Themistocleous, a 2017 Post alumnus who is the Tilles Center’s guest services manager, said that the Tilles Center staff worked with the Nassau County Police Department, the former president’s secret service, and the Old Brookville police to ensure everyone’s safety during the event. “I’m really happy about the Global Institute being a part of LIU. Steve Israel’s knowledge and connections can really enlighten everyone on campus, on both sides of the spectrum,” he said.
The Global Institute is partnering with the Hutton House for a book event on, “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign” by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. The event will be held in Lorber Hall on Oct. 25 at 1 p.m.

Editor’s Note: In light of recent mass shootings in the U.S., the Pioneer is republishing the university’s guidelines and protocols issued in Feb. 2017 as a public service for the school community.
There have been 317 mass shootings in the United States, close to one every day, in 2017, according to the Gun Violence archive. The harsh reality of mass shootings is that they could occur at any place and anytime. Since 1999, there have been 31 mass school shootings in the United States, which have made worldwide headlines and devastated school communities. The massacres at Columbine High School, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and Virginia Tech University, among others, have led schools, including LIU Post, to strengthen their security protocols and strategize if it were to happen to them.
The LIU Post Department of Public Safety includes 22 full-time, New York State certified security officers. It is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors on LIU Post’s campus. The department works with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments, and the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management. The Public Safety Department created its own guidelines in early 2017, based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s “Active Shooter: How to Respond” booklet, which includes emergency phone numbers and tactics. The guidelines are on the university website at http://liu.edu/cwpost/Public-safety.
According to the university guidelines, “because active shooter situations are often over within ten-to- fteen minutes before law enforcement [or Public Safety] arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared both mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.” Within that time frame, the guidelines suggests to “take note of the two nearest exits,” “secure the door [in the room],” “if in a hallway, get into a room and secure the door,” and as a last resort, “attempt to take the shooter down.” If an active shooter is in your vicinity, the guidelines call to “escape if possible,” and “hideout where the shooter is less likely to find you while [remaining silent].” If you are the first person to call 911, the guidelines suggest to provide the phone operator with as many details possible, including location of the shooter, the number of shooters, if more than one, physical description of the shooter(s), number and type(s) of weapons, and number of potential victims at the location.
Michael Fevola, who became the Director of Public Safety in August 2017, said his team would rely on text messaging and emails during active shooter situations, although he has not experienced one on campus.
“In the event of an incident including an active shooter, Public Safety has protocols in place and the ability to immediately alert the entire campus community via a mass text/email blast with specific advisements and instructions,” Fevola said. “Those messages can also be used to continuously update the community, alert individuals what areas they should stay away from, and what to do, including the “Run/Hide/ Fight” protocols.” The Pioneer reported that the “Run/Hide/Fight” protocol was instituted in February 2017. “[It was] not in response to something happening, just to keep the campus safe,” Dr. John Lutz, English professor and chair of the faculty council, said in The Pioneer’s article, “Stop, Drop, Roll” published on Feb. 15, 2017. Lutz said, at the time, that faculty members had expressed an interest in learning more about campus procedures during an emergency, which led to a meeting for faculty on Feb. 1. At the meeting, Paul Rapess, the former director of Public Safety who retired last summer, discussed the new procedure, which implemented to keep up to date with happenings.
The Public Safety department routinely conducts joint training exercises with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments on campus. With this training in place, local police have a better feel for the campus during emergency situations.
According to LIU Post’s CampusFirearms & Weapons Policy, which is available on the LIU website under ‘University Policies,’ says “the possession of dangerous weapons, including any pistol, revolver, an incendiary bomb, switchblade, dagger or bludgeon, as well as harmless instruments designed to look like weapons are prohibited” on campus. “Other than police officers or military personnel on active duty, no person, including a licensee, may possess rearms anywhere on campus, whether in a building or on the grounds, without the prior written permission of the campus Provost and Director of Public Safety.” Violators of this policy will be subject to immediate disciplinary action and potential criminal prosecution. LIU Post strictly enforces its campus gun policy. As The Pioneer reported several years ago, on Nov. 17, 2011, a 72-year-old criminal justice adjunct professor accidentally shot himself in the groin and leg before his class. Although he was a retired Fire Marshall licensed to carry a weapon, the no weapons policy on campus was strictly enforced and he no longer teaches at LIU Post.
Katherine Hill-Miller, English professor and former dean of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences suggests every student and staff member should sign up for the Public Safety alerts, and said she would follow direction from Public Safety in an emergency.
“My first action would be to check for the text message and follow its directions,” Hill-Miller said. “If a message hadn’t come through, I’d assume that the incident hadn’t been reported, so I’d dial 911 first and then call campus security. Barring any information from anybody, I’d evaluate the situation—if the shooter was close, I’d gather students away from windows and doors in the classroom.”
Freshman education major Amanda Iovino agrees that the public safety alerts would come in handy in times of danger. “The texts are very useful in times of bad weather, and I think if [a school shooting] was to happen, the texts would be crucial.”
Fevola advises students and staff members to always be alert to their surroundings. While school shootings do not happen very often, he stressed that anything could happen, and one person reporting a suspicious person could potentially save lives.
“Stay vigilant and follow the old adage ‘see something, say something,’” Fevola said. “Any odd or unusual behavior should be reported to Public Safety, and we always protect [the] anonymity of the caller.”

“Beginning in the 2019-20 academic year, LIU will compete in all sports at the NCAA Division I level, with a unified athletics program that will join our campuses into One LIU,” university president Kimberly Cline wrote in an email announcement to the LIU community on Wednesday, Oct. 3, halfway into the fall 2018 season, and two weeks after the academic add/ drop period deadline on Sept. 18.
“The unification of the Division I and Division II athletic teams into a more robust Division I program will have long term benefits for LIU and the Northeast Conference from an athletic, academic and community standpoint,” NEC commissioner Noreen Morris said during an LIU press conference at the New York Athletic Club on Oct. 3.
Along with seven Post sports teams being elevated from Division II to Division I, the LIU Post basketball (men’s and women’s), women’s bowling, women’s fencing, softball, women’s swimming, track & field (men’s and women’s), and women’s volleyball teams will move to the Brooklyn campus, where a multipurpose athletic facility will begin construction in 2019. New women’s ice hockey and water polo teams will be added in Brooklyn.
The LIU Post football team will move to the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), the lower of the two Division I levels. Football players are excited about the change, as they will not be losing their positions. LIU Brooklyn has no football team, and their stadium will be renovated to meet Division I regulations.
The announcement, which emphasized the unity of the individual athletics programs into “One LIU,” has rocked student athletes on the Post campus. For many of the Pioneers, this is not exciting news.
All Post sports teams play under the NCAA Division II, as they have since their inception. The sudden announcement of the transition to Division I in the middle of the current season has caused distress and uncertainty among many Post athletes about their future athletic and academic careers. Post students will have to re-tryout for positions on the new Division I rosters, competing with current LIU Brooklyn students and freshmen recruits for those same spots next year.
Sports that are combining include basketball (men’s and women’s), soccer (men’s and women’s), baseball, softball and women’s lacrosse. The men’s lacrosse and men’s cross country will move to the Northeast Conference.
Ashley Melendez, a senior childhood and early education major, was one of the unhappy students on the softball team. “We could not believe the news. We were all heartbroken that this selfish decision was made without even speaking to any of the athletes,” she said. “We were completely blindsided and devastated that this selfish act is going to break our family apart.”
An FAQ page posted on Oct. 3 on the new one.liu.edu, or athletics.liu.edu website addresses questions about the change. The question of Post athletes being able to continue their positions in the Division I teams has student athletes most concerned. According to the site, the athletics department “will personally work with each individual student-athlete to review all potential opportunities athletically and academically within the new athletic department.”
Newsday reported on Wednesday, Oct. 3 that, “LIU teams will draw athletes from both campuses,” but, “the 2019- 20 rosters will be decided at the discretion of each team.”
Many Post athletes, who qualified for Division II sports, fear they will not make the new teams. “There’s a chance that we might get cut. We don’t know anything; we don’t know
if we are going to keep our coach. We literally have nothing,” Jillian Lomanto, a junior education major and member of the lacrosse team, said. Without further information, Lomanto believes nothing about their team will remain the same.
The method and timing of the announcement were questioned by students and faculty. Many athletes feel underappreciated. “When the president announced it, she didn’t take the athletes’ feelings into consideration. She literally just said this is fine, she’s getting paid for this. It’s the athletes who are getting hurt right now,” Lomanto said.
The students are also concerned about their coaches. “It’ll be very hard if my coach is not the same coach [for women’s lacrosse]. If she’s [Coach Megan McNamara] not the coach, none of us are going to be playing,” Katelyn Politi, a sophomore elementary education and special education major, said.
International student-athletes were especially concerned. Those who were recruited internationally were either signed into a contract to play in Division II, or can only play in Division II based on their semi-professional athletic careers in their home countries before enrolling at LIU Post. Multiple Post teams, such as the women’s and men’s soccer teams, have rosters comprised of mainly international players.
The unified sports teams will have an even bigger impact on campus. The school’s colors will change from the Pioneers green and gold and the Blackbirds blue and black, to a unified blue and gold. The cost of replacing and redesigning the signs and facilities, including the upgrade of both campus athletic facilities, the Bethpage Credit Union Stadium and new uniforms, apparel and signage on both campuses, could be high.
The Bethpage Credit Union Stadium will receive a makeover, with upgraded grandstands to improve sight lines for fans, and to meet Division I standards. “This project will make Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium among the most modern facilities of its size on the East Coast and provide an ideal game day environment for our student-athletes and supporters,” according to a statement on the athletics.liu.edu site.
Roy Fergus, the director of facilities services for both campuses, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the timing, execution and price of these projects.
Unifying the university athletic departments under Division I could help increase the profile of the school, as LIU’s administration stated in the statement announcing the change, however it will come with sacrifices, according to multiple students and faculty members.
“What’s stunning about the LIU announcement is the consolidation of sports from two autonomous campuses, one Division I and one Division II, with different colors and mascots, and telling roughly half the 1,600 student-athletes that they’ll no longer have an athletics future at LIU,” Willie Hiatt, associate professor of history, said. “We’re forcing them to compete against each other for roster spots. I can’t imagine that a ‘Hunger Games’ scenario like that happens very often.”
Hiatt believes there was an unspoken reason for the merger. “The timing of the announcement also was a slap in the face to athletes. The slick ‘One LIU’ branding didn’t happen overnight,” he said. “Why didn’t the administration make this announcement at least last spring or summer to give students the chance to find another school? With another small freshman class of 550 students or so, was this to avoid worsening our enrollment crisis? And why do this after the add/drop period? If we care about our students, we should allow them a full tuition refund if they choose to leave LIU right now. That’s the least we can do. If I were a parent, I’d be asking for that for my child,” Hiatt said.
Lacrosse player Politi agrees with Hiatt on the timing. “I don’t think [the administration] did it in the right way,” she said. “Especially for people recruited over the summer. They didn’t tell them and [the recruited students] make decisions [on where to go to school] and they had no idea that they were going from a D.2 to a D.1 program, which is a huge difference.”
Students and faculty believe that the change had been planned for some time. “If they knew about [this change] for years, they should’ve told us the summer of 2018 so people had time to digest this new information, instead of telling teams during and right
before their seasons,” Veronica Saager, a junior special education major and member of the women’s soccer team, said.
“If I was a freshman, I might look into transferring,” Lomanto said.
Student athletes are still debating their next steps. Students have created several protests on social media, including a petition that now has over three thousand signatures and a not.my.liu.post Instagram page that has over 400 followers.

Overlord” was released in theaters on Nov. 9. The movie is set hours before D-Day (June 6, 1944) and follows the actions of five survivors as they ambush Nazi-occupied France for a crucial mission. With the apocalypse stirring, the surviving paratroopers face some rather unusual enemies. Actor Wyatt Russell plays a key role in the film, and has appeared in several movies, including “22 Jump Street” and “This is 40.” Compared to these, “Overlord” has a darker, gorier theme.

Russell plays Corporal Ford, a “hard-headed individual whose team is caught in a tricky predicament.” He spoke about his character and the challenges he faced in his role. “It was physically demanding,” he said.
“Maintaining high energy was hard for three and a half months,” Russell said. Along with the physical exhaustion, the cast worked with dangerous equipment. “None of the gun fire was CGI (computer-generated imagery),” he said. “That’s what made the movie fun.”
Russell worked with producer J.J.Abrams who is known for producing films including “Star Trek” and “Mission Impossible: Fallout.” “It was great, knowing that as you’re acting you are being graced by the hand of J.J. is very confidence-boosting,” he said. Most of a producer’s work appears after the bulk of filming is completed. “It’s always good news when a producer doesn’t come to set [often],” Russell said.
When the film opened, Rotten Tomatoes gave it an 81 percent positive reaction. Anthony Uly, senior international business major, saw the movie on its opening date. “If you ever wished that ‘Saving Private Ryan’ was a B-movie (low-budget movie) splatterfest, it [Overlord] totally is. I really enjoyed it,” Uly said. “The cinematography was pretty good, overall storyline was unexpectedly great, and I liked the female lead; she gave me a little Wonder Woman tease.”
Russell described the movie as a “popcorn movie,” something that people go to see in the theater. “I want it to be a movie [for the audience] to go with their friends and see something that people put a lot of effort into,” he said.
Many World War, apocalyptic films have appeared over the years, but “Overlord” takes to the imagery of the apocalypse even further through the use of pyrotechnics and lack of green screens. “The best World War II movie has already been made— ‘Saving Private Ryan’— that changed the way a generation saw that war,” Russell said. “You’re not reinventing the wheel; just [looking at] a different take.”

The NBA season kicked off on Tuesday, Oct.19, and the landscape of the league might not look how many would have expected it. Teams predicted to be at the top of their conferences have struggled, while some teams have blown away expectations in the early going. 
One team that has caught some fans off guard is the Golden State Warriors.
Junior broadcasting major Ryan Boettcher has very high expectations for Golden State.  
“I think the Warriors have the most well-rounded team in the NBA,” he said. 
Boettcher believes that the Nets likely have the most star power and that the two teams should be considered the “main championship contenders” in their respective conferences. The Warriors, who are in first place in the West ahead of the surging Phoenix Suns and the Utah Jazz, are now expecting star Klay Thompson to return before Christmas Day, according to The Athletic.
Other success stories have come as a surprise to fans.
“Some teams that have surprised me have been the Cavaliers with the great play from Evan Mobley, and then the Wizards with their subtraction of Westbrook for Dinwiddie and many Lakers role players,” Boettcher said.
The third pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, Evan Mobley, is an early contender for rookie of the year and has been better than expected. Cleveland has had a better record than most would have predicted at the start of the year, in part due to the addition of veteran point guard Ricky Rubio.
It hasn’t all been positive. Boettcher expressed there are some teams underperforming their abilities.
“A team that has disappointed me has to be the Timberwolves. This season was really the first time their main core have been healthy together, and they have been underwhelming,” Boettcher said.
While second-year guard Anthony Edwards has raised his scoring to 23 points per game, star center Karl-Anthony Towns has not taken the next step as a leader that many Timberwolves fans would have liked to see in order to make Minnesota a serious contender.
The hometown New York Knicks face questions about their rotation, as their bench lineup is one of the most effective in the NBA while the starters have struggled to build chemistry. The bench lineup features five returning players in Derrick Rose, Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, and Taj Gibson, while the starters have struggled to incorporate new additions Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier.

The 2022 Major League Baseball season has concluded. This immediately leads into the MLB offseason, which brings about all the free agent signings, trades and any other roster moves made by every major league club. 
The Yankees and Mets have both been at the forefront of much of the coverage surrounding offseason news. After breaking the American League home run record and being named AL MVP, Yankees superstar Aaron Judge became a free agent following his first six seasons in pinstripes. 
On Wednesday, Dec. 7, it was announced the Yankees and Aaron Judge agreed to a 9-year deal worth $360 million. 
This is the third largest contract in baseball history, only trailing extensions given to Mike Trout and Mookie Betts. It is also the largest deal ever for a free agent. 
Just one night prior, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Aaron Judge was headed to the San Francisco Giants, but immediately corrected himself after jumping the alert. 
After the announcement of Judge returning to the Bronx, it was confirmed Aaron Judge turned down a 10-year deal from the San Diego Padres worth $400 million. The Average annual value (AAV) from the two offers is the same at $40 million. However, Judge would have received an extra year had he accepted the Padres’ offer. 
Senior digital art & design major Anthony Hines confirms resigning Aaron Judge was the Yankees’ top need this off-season. 
“One of the Yankees’ top priorities, much like how it was of the utmost importance, was to re-sign Judge,” he said. “The face of your franchise and the AL MVP had to be back in the Bronx, especially after he hit 62 home runs and broke the American League home run record.”
Hines believes Judge should be named captain to secure his legacy as a career Yankee.
“I would expect the Yanks to give Judge the captaincy. They made the commitment, he’s a Yankee for life, now let’s give him that honor,” he said.
Hines is happy with the acquisitions the Yankees have made so far but would love a couple more pieces to be brought in. 
Besides Tommy Kahnle, the Yankees have brought back Anthony Rizzo and Judge. I wouldn’t be surprised if we land Carlos Rodon to pair him well with Gerrit Cole in our rotation,” he said. “I wanna say we’ll make a sneaky run at Dansby Swanson. I just have that feeling.”
On the other side of the Whitestone Bridge, the Mets have been making many acquisitions as the third offseason of Steve Cohen’s ownership continues to bring high hopes to fans. 
Despite two-time CY Award Winner Jacob Degrom leaving in free agency, signing a 5-year, $185 million contract with the Texas Rangers, the Mets quickly looked for other pitching options. 
The Mets locked up 17-year veteran and reigning AL CY Young Award winner Justin Verlander to a 2-year deal worth $86,666,666, with a vesting option worth $35 million in 2025, pending Verlander pitches 140 innings in 2024. 
This is similar to the 3-year, $130 million deal the Mets agreed to with Max Scherzer last offseason. Currently, the Mets have both Scherzer and Verlander for the next two years, each making $43,333,333. With Scherzer now 38 years old, and Verlander heading into his age 40 season, it is clear the Mets will try and get the final productive years out of the veteran starters. 
The Mets also signed Japanese phenom Kodai Senga to a 5-year, $75 million deal following his 11-year career in the Nippon Professional Baseball League. 
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell had high expectations for the Mets’ off-season. 
“My top priorities were retaining our guys, especially Edwin Diaz, Brandon Nimmo and DeGrom, while also looking for hitters and bullpen help,” he said. 
Following his incredible 2022 campaign, which featured 32 saves and a 1.31 ERA, the Mets brought back their closer Diaz to a 5-year, $102 million deal with a 6th-year club option. 
Campbell believes it was crucial for the Mets to make the signings to keep their pitching at a top-tier level. 
“It was huge to get Verlander and Senga. After DeGrom and Walker left, I wasn’t sure where we would pivot to, but Steve Cohen and Billy Eppler were able to go all out to win over some of the best pitchers on the market,” he said. “Verlander may be older, but he is still one of the premier pitchers in the game, and Senga has superstar potential. Those two moves were very important after losing DeGrom and Walker.”
The Mets also re-signed outfielder Brandon Nimmo to an 8-year, $162 million deal following his seven seasons in a Mets uniform. Campbell believes bringing back a home-grown talent was a great move. 
“Nimmo has always been an important player on this team. He may not be a superstar, but the type of way he plays is very unique. He is a very consistent and disciplined hitter, and he is always reliable in the outfield,” he said. “He’s always the hardest worker, and you can see how much he loves being a Met. He is a fan favorite, and I think he can play a crucial role in this team’s pursuit of a championship.”
Campbell has high hopes for the Mets’ future following their moves so far. 
“I am very happy with what has been done thus far. I still think they need another big bat or two and a few more bullpen arms, but overall I am pleased and very excited for the 2023 season and beyond,” he said.

Letter to the readers,
Not only is the season changing, there ís a new air on campus.  It’s not that fresh cool breeze that slips through your window screens at night either.  Students are a little rambunctious and more energetic than usual this week.  You might have even seen some familiar faces- former students or faculty (cough, cough alumni.)  The athletic teams, especially the football team, have more adrenaline pumping through their veins because this is just any weekend for Post.  It’s Homecoming weekend!!
This is the one weekend that current and past Postonians take the most pride in. Essentially it’s the one time of the year when the entire school really comes together.  Students gather at the pep rally on Friday night.  The residence halls compete for the best and most creative skit, athletic teams are introduced for the seasons, a DJ provides the music and suddenly you are caught up with the crowd that’s singing some song you don’t even know.  But you sure as hell are having a fun time!  Then Saturday comes and everyone watches the football game on Hickox field.  There’s tailgating in the Pratt parking lot, families of students come from all over the states, alumni return to play in athletic games or just to come and enjoy the day with their alma mater!
If you’re a freshmen, than you have to experience this for yourself.  Trust us, this is not an event to miss at Post.  But before we get too carried away, lets introduce the sixth edition of our student newspaper.  Many interesting articles this week; one focuses on the increase of tuition, while one of our editors discusses the two primary candidates for New York governor.  In sports, both the boys and girls cross-country teams traveled to sunny Florida and came back with a few record-breaking times.
As for our arts and entertainment section of Loomings, we are still looking for anyone interested in writing book, movie or game reviews.  Please email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.comÖdonít forget, we are still looking for that 50th email to give away that $500 prize!
From your staff of the Pioneer, Happy Homecoming and good luck Pioneers!

Conversations Helping and Teaching Stu¬dents, C.H.A.T.S., a program created in 2009, is in the process of becoming an official club at LIU Post. In C.H.A.T.S., an American student and an international student are paired as partners so the two can learn about each other’s cultures and become friends. This gives the internationals students the opportunity to improve and practice their English. 
The offices of International Student Services and Religious Life created C.H.A.T.S. in 2009 and act as co-sponsors for the organization. This semester, C.H.A.T.S. has begun the process of becoming an official club by creating an executive board and attending three Student Government Association meetings. The new executive board consists of five students: Alize Margulis, Rika Tatsukawa, Arti Jain, Terry Chang and Serena Oditt, who will attend the Student Government Association meetings to represent C.H.A.T.S. Father Ted, who is in charge of the Newman Catholic Club, and Jeanette Murray, who works at International Students Services, advise the students. Three coordinators oversee the organization Murray, as well as Trica Figuero and Dr. Leslie Bai. 
“Make another friend; you always need a friend,” said Figuero. C.H.A.T.S. was created to try to build up the connection between international and Americans students. It also serves to improve international students’ command of the English language, allow international students to learn more about American culture, and permit American students to learn about different cultures. This may lead to inviting their partner home for Thanksgiving, and even visiting their partner’s country, said Bai. “International students feel intimidated and lonely. If they find someone who knows American life, they can meet through C.H.A.T.S. first and then become friends later on their own,” said Bai. 
All the C.H.A.T.S. partners are the same gender and are partners for one year. The partners usually meet once a week for about an hour. When, where, what you do and for how long you meet are entirely up to you and your partner. There are also monthly group events for everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. One of the first events this semester was International Friendship Night, which was held on September 20 in the Chapel. The event consisted of games, dancing, food and international trivia. The next event is a presentation on exploring New York on October 11 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. There is an Inter¬national Education Week Dinner planned for November 12 at 7 in the Tilles Center and a farewell party on December 6 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. “The events are open to everyone. We are always encouraging and welcoming visitors and new members, if interested,” said Bai. 
There is an application form which helps with the pairing process. Students fill out their major, hobbies and if they have a preference of what type partner they would like, said Bai. She said last fall there were 50 pairs, last spring there were 39 pairs, and there are currently 27 pairs. However, students join throughout the semester. Students, faculty and staff are all members of C.H.A.T.S. The staff members who are involved in C.H.A.T.S. are Trica Figuero, Dr. Leslie Bai, Jeanette Murray and Nadia Hernandez, who all work at International Students Services. 
“The biggest headache now is there are always more international students then American students,” said Bai. Many international students are waiting for a partner. Bai said new international students are their first priority but returning international students are also waiting. There is a lack of male American students. Many American students are needed and males are needed the most right now, said Figuero. “We have included staff members, and some domestic students take two partners,” said Figuero, to try to solve the problem of not having enough American members. “We try to recruit students at (club) fairs, but it is always hard to get them to commit,” said Bai. 
Bai said many show interest in C.H.A.T.S. while they are recruiting but then they say they are too busy. “Some people are afraid of the commitment; time is an issue,” said Figuero. The coordinators say the group meeting and weekly partner meetings are not mandatory. The events are held so that everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. can get together and do some sort of activity. As long as you are spending individual time with your partner, you do not have to attend the events. C.H.A.T.S. is extremely flexible. “It’s not something to be fearful of or stress out about; just try it” said Figuero. They said they want more American students to learn from this experience. “You don’t have to do something extra; you can bring your partner to something you go to already,” said Bai. 
Being a member of C.H.A.T.S., and acquiring knowledge about another culture, will enhance your resume and work experience as well, said Figuero. Clubs can also pick up partners. Every club on campus has to do a certain amount of hours of community service and earn points for it. If you are on another club on campus and need to earn community service points, you can earn them by joining C.H.A.T.S. If there are a few partners per club, they will give you about half of the points needed. “Internationalization, we want more students to open up, even make our campus a little different,” said Figuero. 
Rika Tatsukawa, a senior Public Relations major from Japan, has been a member of C.H.A.T.S. since September 2011. Tatsukawa was partners with Arti Jain, a junior English Education major, last year. The partners are continuing to work together through C.H.A.T.S. this year as well. “At first, I didn’t expect her to be such a good friend and now I can’t image campus life without her,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she meets, texts and messages her partner often. “I meet Arti at her house a lot, her mother makes Indian food which I love,” said Tatsukawa. She said she went to her C.H.A.T.S. partner’s house for Thanksgiving, her birthday and Christmas. She also said she has met most of her family. “Now I don’t think of her as a partner; I just think of her as one of my friends,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she and Arti have similar feelings to be kind to others and common sense. 
Taksukawa said that C.H.A.T.S. has made her more compassionate to others, especially foreigners. “If I go back to Japan and see foreigners, I want to take care of them and help them because now I know how they feel. Taksukawa thinks that American and inter¬national students can learn a lot from each other. “I wish American students can learn from International students. In the future, it can help them with their work if they know that culture,” said Taksukawa. She said she taught her partner how to say hello in Japanese, “Konnichiwa,” and thank you, “Arigato.” 
Alize Margulis, a junior International Studies major has been part of C.H.A.T.S. since she was a freshman. “I joined C.H.A.T.S. because I thought it was the best way to learn about other cultures and customs,” said Margulis. Her first C.H.A.T.S. partner was Winny Wang, a graduate student from China studying Science Research. She said she found similarities between Wang’s culture and her own. “Winny almost always boils water and drinks the water as such; whereas I would boil water but I would drink it only if I had diffused a tea bag,” said Marguilis.
Last year, Marguilis and her former partner, Kotona Uzumaki, a Business major from Japan, were C.H.A.T.S ambassadors. “We spoke at various C.H.A.T.S. events and were nominated and received certification for Outstanding C.H.A.T.S. Partners of the Year 2012,” said Marguilis. She said her past two partners have become her really close friends. “Kotona, who was studying abroad in the U.S. for one year was in two of my classes , and once we became C.H.A.T.S. partners, we went to various club events on campus and explored off campus too,” said Marguilis. She said she feels she taught her partner how to be comfortable in her home when inviting her over for holidays and dinner. Marguilis said her two past partners taught her many phrases in Chinese and Japanese. She said she and Uzumaki would see shows in the city and at the Tilles Center as well as spend time in her neighborhood. Marguilis still keeps in contact both of her C.H.A.T.S. partners through Skype and e-mail. “I’m hoping to travel to Asia one day, so I know I will be able to explore their countries with them too!” she said.
This year Marguilis is partnered with a student from China named Shuai Shuai, but she has not met her yet. She said she wishes more American students joined C.H.A.T.S. “LIU Post provides this opportunity through the C.H.A.T.S. program, but I feel not enough domestic students are committed or interested in becoming a partner. I understand many students have busy agendas, but how complicated is it to take one hour per week out of your time to meet with some one?” said Marguilis.
She said she has truly enjoyed her experience as a member of C.H.A.T.S. “Inter¬national friends have certain values that we as Americans don’t. I am not bashing Americans, but we should embrace other cultures and be open to learning about them, especially in this globalized business world that we live in today,” said Marguilis.

LIU Post was offered a special opportunity to display President Lincoln’s only surviving handwritten draft of the emancipation Proclamation in the Tilles Center of Performing Arts at the “First Step to Freedom: Abraham Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation” exhibit. The final version of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863, was destroyed in a fire in Chicago in 1871. The draft is the only remaining copy, which led to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom of slaves. The New York State Legislature purchased the draft in 1865 days after Lincoln passed away.
LIU Post is the only Long Island exhibitor of this rare document while it goes on a state-wide tour to mark the 150thanniversary of one of the nation’s greatest accomplishments. LIU Post and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts are pleased and honored to join with the New York State Education Department and SUNY College of Old Westbury in presenting these national treasures to the community,» said Dr. Paul Forestell. Along with Lincoln’s draft, a speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the centennial anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation is also on display next to the draft. 
Students who have seen the historical document expressed their admiration for it. “I think it’s great we we’re able to see a part of history in the Tilles Center,” says Mitch Mark, senior Psychology major. “It’s almost like reliving a part of history and it’s really special.” Matt Aronberg, an Information Studies graduate student says, “It’s amazing how a piece of paper was able to change so much of our history and to make our country the way it is now.”
At the opening ceremony held in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall during Common Hour, Dr. Forestell, Dr. Steinberg, Dr. John B. King, Jr., Andrew P. Jackson and Robert Tilles reminded visitors that freedom and equality hasn’t been reached yet. Robert Tilles explains to those in attendance the segregation on Long Island. “We have pockets of poverty. We drove along the road between the high and low performing [school] districts, and you see people across the street here look at people across the street there saying, ‘how come they get the best education and how come we get the worst education?’”
Both historical documents were on display for the public with free admission on October 15 and 16 from1 pm to 9 pm. The exhibit was offered in partnership with LIU Post, LIU Votes and the Tilles Center of Performing Arts.

After 13 months of campaigning, rallying, and debating, Barack Obama will begin his second term in the White House. Although he beat former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in a landslide in electoral votes, he was not as popular amongst all Americans.
According to A CNN article published this month, “Obama takes key battlegrounds to win re-election” by Tom Cohen, Obama won all battleground states as well as Romney’s birthplace of Michigan and his governing state of Massachusetts, with 332 electoral votes. Romney won 206 electoral votes.  Obama needed only 270 electoral votes to win the election. But, Obama did not win the popular vote with such a wide margin. According to the BBC U.S. 2012 results, 50.5 percent of the country voted for Obama while 47.9 voted for Romney, leaving the nation divided.
In Chicago, Obama supporters roared and cheered once Obama’s victory was announced, while television networks showed coverage of Romney supporters somber and crying. Republicans still had hope since Fox News Analyst Karl Rove had reported that Romney might still have a chance in winning Ohio. Shortly after Obama won the battleground state. After Romney’s concession speech, one Romney supporter stated that the fact that Romney lost was “a tough pill to swallow.”
A new Romney appeared on stage, less aggressive and more somber than we’ve seen him in the past months. An hour after news networks projected Barack Obama as victor, in Boston, Romney, whose eyes appeared to be red and watery, conceded, “I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation. The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing. I believe in America, I believe in the people of America.”
In Barack Obama’s acceptance speech, he stated, “Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs – not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together…..We’ve got more work to do.”
Changes promised for students under Obama’s Presidency:
Student debt has reached $1 trillion for the fist time in history. Students will begin to see Obama’s Pay as You Earn program reiterated on certain websites where students can apply for loans. The Pay as You Earn program, which will be in effect in 2013-2014, caps monthly federal student loan repayment at 10 percent of one’s monthly income. This is so students have more money to spend and invest in the economy, according to Barackobama.com. Also, under this program, a student can choose the college they want to attend based on their career goals and not solely on the price of tuition. In addition, if one pays their federal loans on time and at least at 10 percent of your monthly income as a teacher, service person, or doctor, one will be forgiven of federal loans after 10 years. For all other professions, if loans are paid responsibly, one will be forgiven in 20 years.
The Know Before You Owe program is a form that includes loan interest rates while differentiating between grants and scholarships, showing students exactly what they will be paying, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the U.S. Department of Education. The form would also be introduced as a universal Financial Aid document that all colleges would be urged to adopt by the 2013-14 school year. This would allow students to see what they are being offered and how much they could possibly pay, before they accept the offer to attend that school. President Obama also insured that veterans and service members would be able to get a college education and find work when they return from service by implementing and expanded the post-9/11 G.I. Bill, according to BarackObama.com.
He also proposes to make higher education institutions more affordable, even though a written bill has yet to be written out and plans lack details, according to “With Obama’s Win, Colleges Anticipate 4 More Years of Reform,” by Michael Stratford in Chronicle.com this month. According to WhiteHouse.gov, the official website of the White House, Obama stated, “Higher education is not a luxury. Earning a postsecondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs.”
The President will be inaugurated for his second term on January 21, 2013 in Washington D.C.

This fall, there have been incessant complaints from students about the shortage of food at Winnick Dining Hall, as well as the low number of staff members working at Winnick, which, according to diners, is causing delays and difficulties when it comes to servicing students during meal times.
Students have reported that they have to wait in long lines with bad service, and that they aren’t provided healthy options, or even fresh food. “The only options there are [at Winnick] are hamburgers and pizza and the salad bar is usually stocked with lettuce that has been left out and is brown,” said Melissa Nosel, a junior English Library Science major.
Winnick’s hours have also caused some grumbling among students. Nosel says that Winnick doesn’t open until 7.30 a.m. However, like many students, Nosel has an 8 a.m. class. As a result, she is unable to get breakfast before her classes begin for the day.
“The one station that I love is the pasta station and it is closed half the time to keep open the pizza station because they don’t have enough staff to run all of the stations,” Nosel said. “There are six or seven stations, and most of the stations are closed because there is not enough staff to run them. The lines are out the door because they have one worker at each station trying to feed thousand[s of] students at [a] time, especially during common hour. I can’t count the amount of times that there were no utensils, no cereal, and the vending machines were broken.”
The lack of healthy options poses a problem for some students, especially those with medical conditions that make them unable to eat certain foods. Stacie Palacino, a senior Child Education major who underwent surgery to remove her gallbladder, has been forced to eliminate fats and gluten from her diet. Palacino claims that Winnick told her that they would accommodate her dietary needs, but there are still not a lot of healthy options and the salad bar is never stocked.
Ultimately, Palacino made the decision in Fall 2012 to become a commuter because of the lack of dietary options provided for her in the dining hall. “[Living on campus] just wasn’t working,” said Palacino. “I’m much happier now. I can make my food from home and I know that I’m eating healthy foods that I can eat, and not the greasy foods [that were provided for me at Winnick].”
Paul Carroll, Director of Operations of Aramark, the food service provider at LIU Post, states that there are no staff shortages at Winnick, and certainly no food shortages: “We currently have no [worker] shortages at Winnick Hall with the exception of some weekend coverage that is generally covered with student workers,” said Carroll. “We have 55 union members at Winnick Hall, and [many of them] are long-term union members who have served us well. We have no future plans of any change.”
Carroll also stated that the complaints of food shortages are unfounded. “We currently have the same amount of stations open as last semester,” Carroll said. “This includes pizza, pasta, street food, grill, home zone, dessert, salad bar, vegetarian-yogurt bar, deli, continental breakfast and cold food setup. There are no plans currently to change any food options, however we did introduce two new meal plans for commuter students.”
Resident students are used to using the magnetic stripe on the back of their student ID card in place of using cash to pay for food. LIU has instituted a brand new meal plan for commuter students that provide them the same food services as resident students. When a full-time commuter student uses their student ID card, they will automatically receive $50 to get them started. Commuter students will be able to choose from a 25 Block Plan, which provides 25 meals per semester and 50 dining dollars; a 50 Block Plan, which provides 50 meals per semester and 50 dining dollars; and the Commuter Dining Dollar Plan, which allows students to add more dollars to their plans at any time.
Despite this change, resident students believe that commuter students will only face the same problems that they do when it comes to the food selection and services.
“I’m cutting down my meal plan next semester,” said Nosel. “I have a meal plan for three meals a day, and yet I don’t use it most of the time because there is no food there a lot of the time and bad service.”
There are students who feel as though most of their dietary needs are being met with only little complaint or concern. “Overall, it could be worse,” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. “If I avoid the chicken then I’m usually very happy.”
The Pioneer was unable to receive a comment from Administration; Abagail Van Vlerah, the Dean of Students, referred Jackie Nealon, the Chief of Staff and Vice President of Enrollment, Campus Life, and Communications. Nealon chose not to comment on the matter, but referred to Aramark.

As The Pioneer reported on Sept. 30, the LIU Post equestrian team set out to complete a daunting mission—raise enough money to rescue a slaughter- bound miniature horse, and make him the team mascot. The team held a bake sale during common hour in Hillwood Commons, posted flyers throughout campus seeking donations, and even created a web page on gofundme.com so that others could donate money to pay for the purchase and future expenses of the miniature horse.
After a lot of hard work and dedication, the girls were finally financially able to travel to the horse auction located in New Holland, Pennsylvania and choose which lucky horse would be coming home with them for another chance at life as their team mascot.
The mission took place on Oct. 13. Hope, a sweet palomino mare, caught the riders’ attention right away. Two of the three team captains, Cristina Bakos, a senior Speech Pathology/Pre-Med major, and Alex Diez, a junior Biology major, as well as one of the fundraisers, Christina Cepeda, a junior Psychology major, brought the mini horse to her new home in Bakos’ backyard barn in Nesconset, where she will have a much more exciting life with the other mini horses—and a donkey—already living there.
All of the money raised by the team will be put towards the many expenses needed to properly care for any horse, including veterinary and farrier appointments (hoof trimming), board, feed, wormer, shavings, and clothing. Hope had a warm welcome to the LIU Post equestrian team when she made her mascot debut at the annual Homecoming Football Game on Saturday, Oct. 18. For such a tiny equine, Hope handled the loud, crazy football game quite well. She tried her best to not get too overwhelmed.
“She was calm at homecoming, but would sometimes get startled with sudden, loud noises like popping balloons or the loud music, but eventually she got accustomed to the all the noise,” said team member Colleen Dreyer, a senior Public Relations major and the team’s Treasurer.
The day at homecoming was a success, which even included raising more money to care for Hope in the future. The equestrian team raised $1,110 through their “Go Fund Me” account, which is linked on the team’s Facebook page. To donate money to help Hope, you can go to www.gofundme.com/save- a-pony, or email christina.kotarski@my.liu.edu or christina.cepeda@my.liu.edu.
The next on-campus horse show at the North Shore Equestrian Center will be on Nov. 9, at 8 a.m. Hope, the mini mascot, will be there to show support. The event is open to the public.

What does it mean to be a woman? Where and when did the concept of womanhood come to life? The answers to these questions can be found on the stage in PTC’s production, “Age of Elizabeth.”
Follow modern Elizabeth and her mother’s story of betrayal and her journey through a timeline of mother-daughter relationships in past generations of her family, and the lessons that were passed down by each; discover how the trials women had faced in the past impact the future and define womanhood.
Written and directed by Logan DeWitt, the idea for “Age of Elizabeth” arose from a topic of discussion on nature vs. nurture within DeWitt’s household, where she is the only biological child of seven. DeWitt started to question learned behavior to search for the reasoning behind womanhood.
“I started writing it about a year ago,” DeWitt said. The script is still changing and transforming as the actors go through the workshop and rehearsal process.
The cast consists primarily of women: five Elizabeths, following the usually male tradition of passing down a name, and one man who plays every male character within the show.
DeWitt wanted to center the focus on the women of the play, as opposed to the men, an attempt to pass the Bechdel test. The test identifies the roles of female characters within a play or film based on three questions: whether they are named, interact with other female characters, and talk about anything other than a male character. In the entertainment industry today, many films fail that test. This pushed DeWitt to have a female-driven show.
“It’s really interesting being in this specific show,” said Cayla Michael, sophomore musical theatre major playing as modern Elizabeth. “There are a lot of things that she (Elizabeth) goes through that is personal to me and other people in my life.”
An overbearing and involved mother pressures Elizabeth, an issue that Michael sees reflected in some of her friends. “It gives me a sense of what they must have gone through,” she said.
With all of the focus on content and meaning throughout the play, the set itself is made to be simplistic in a fair contrast. Containing a single chair, three hanging frames to serve as time dividers, and walls on the sides covered in photos, the set establishes a place in time without drawing too much attention from the messages of the story.
What DeWitt wants is for the audience to examine the relationships they have in their own lives and what messages they are sending to one another through their interactions, especially for women. “Are we building one another up,” DeWitt asked, “Or are we subliminally tearing one another down?”
“Age of Elizabeth” will be showing at the Rifle Range Theater on Oct. 28-29 at 8 p.m. and Oct. 30 at 3 p.m.

Nov. 14 was in many ways a Monday like no other. Still reeling from perhaps one of the most tumultuous, momentous and historic elections in the history of American politics, Post’s theatre majors began their weekly retreat back to the classroom.
However, most, if not all theatre majors attending the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building that day were shocked with inspiration when they saw what was waiting for them on the chalkboard in the west wing of the building.
An anonymous creator left a platform for theatre majors to put their dreams into writing, for all of campus to see. The creator has yet to claim responsibility for the mural.
“It’s a board where everyone can talk freely about anything,” said Sabrina Ali, a freshman theatre major, who also works as a receptionist in the department of theatre, dance & arts management. “It’s completely anonymous, it’s us being ourselves.”
With her hands folded, Ali gazed at the mural and said, “We want to be free, and this wall is our outlet.” According to Ali, the mural only began with the words ‘Before I Die, I want to…” and since then, this outlet has grown every day, consistently, by the hour, with each student and one dream at a time.
While Ali was speaking, three students passed by the mural and one contributed, writing what she wishes to accomplish before her time comes: “Make Mom and Dad Proud.”
The mural of motivation has no names, signatures, or any other form of identification. Regardless of whether it’s an image, quote, or simply just a word, this mural allows members of the student body to peacefully and properly display their thoughts, their emotions, and their perspective.
“We seem to learn a lot more about one another when we reveal ourselves to one another,” said Jacob Lackey, a freshman undeclared major. “I think the mural humanizes us, and in a digital world, we sometimes lose touch of that.”
With no plans to remove it, the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building mural currently remains untouched, located on the old chalkboard in the west wing of the building. Students who wish to view and/or contribute to the mural are welcome to do so as long as reverence is shown for classes that may be in attendance.

At 6:57 a.m. on a rainy Monday morning, Oct. 30, an announcement was sent via email and text message to students and faculty notifying them that all Monday classes would be cancelled. According to the notice, “due to a power outage, all classes at LIU Post are cancelled for today, Monday, October 30. Faculty and administrative offices are closed. For Tilles Center call 516-299- 3100. Library closed.” Many parts of Long Island had lost power due to the heavy rains and winds throughout the night on Sunday.
The university sent a second email, an hour later, to inform students what services would be open on campus. “Public Safety, Facilities, Dining, and Campus Life staff are fully prepared to service the campus throughout the outage,” the email said. The shuttle bus service to Hicksville was operating on a regular schedule. However, the only available dining option for students was Winnick Student Center, which operated on an extended schedule from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Campus Life staff held activities to keep students occupied during the day, including bingo and Monday night football in the Winnick Student Center Gold Coast room. Members of the campus life staff and resident assistants were available in the residence hall lobbies throughout the day.
Michael Berthel, dean of students, confirmed the buildings affected by the power outage. “On Oct. 30, several buildings on the LIU Post campus were affected by a power outage due to an off-campus issue. As a result of the outage, most academic buildings, the Pratt Recreation Center, Library, and Hillwood Commons were operating on emergency power,” he wrote in an email responding to the Pioneer’s inquiries. “LIU Post Facilities coordinated with PSEG to address the issue and return power to the campus. Without being able to open essential buildings, the decision was made to cancel classes for the day,” he said.
Sam Scarito, a freshman early childhood education major, lives on campus. “The power outage was pretty inconvenient for me. Post Hall was out for the majority of the night, and people were in the hallways doing their homework.
I wasn’t able to set an alarm and I honestly wondered if I’d wakeup for class or not,” she said. Notification of the school closure was sent via text message and email at 6:57 a.m., when many commuter students and professors were already on their way to their 8 a.m. classes. Jamie Leigh, a senior forensic science major, was driving to her 8 a.m. class when she got the notification. “I usually do not check my phone while I am driving but I had my phone propped on my dashboard while using a navigation app. I feel like this happens all the time. The school should know a significant amount of students commute to school and should have taken into consideration how far some students commute. One hour before the first set of classes is not enough time to notify students,” Leigh said. Freshman accounting major Amanda Norton was an hour into her commute to school. “I think they should’ve sent that message earlier. It’s dumb to wait until 7 a.m. when there [are] commuters with early classes who are already on the road. I wasted my time and gas,” she said.
Michael Semler, a junior international business major also leaves early in the morning to get to classes on time but feels that this power outage could have been prevented. “[The university] should make sure that anything at risk, like equipment servers, [are] secured and contingencies should be in place when equipment fails,” he said.
The Pioneer has previously reported on hurricane preparedness. In “Storm Preparedness In the Wake of Hurricane Nate,” By Jada Butler in the Oct. 10 issue, the Pioneer reported that many buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the event of a power outage. “Several buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the case of a power outage, those being Pell, Hoxie, Roth and Kahn Halls, Humanities, the Winnick and McGrath Houses, Hillwood Commons, the Pratt Recreation Center, the Little Theater and Theater & Film building, the Tilles Center, the library, and all in-use residence halls,” according to the Oct. 10 article. “All other buildings, including the Chapel, the music and sculpture buildings, the Fine Arts Center, and Lorber Hall are equipped with backup emergency lighting.”
According to Berthel, the outage was not caused by an on-campus issue. PSEG, the electric provider for Long Island, was responsible for repairing the power lines to restore power to campus. Power was restored at approximately 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 30. Classes resumed on Tuesday, Oct. 31 on a regular Tuesday schedule. Students have not received any notification about whether the Monday classes will be made up.

“The School for Good and Evil” by Soman Chainani is the first book in a fantastic fantasy series. This first book tells the story of best friends Sophie and Agatha, living in the isolated town of Gavaldon. Every four years on November 11, according to legend, a School Master kidnaps two children from the village. One kidnapped child is always beautiful and kind, and the other is homely and odd. These children are taken to the School for Good and Evil, which exists somewhere beyond the woods surrounding Gavaldon. The children are never seen again, unless they appear in a fairy tale, one as a hero and the other as a villain.
Sophie, who is beautiful and focuses on her looks and good deeds, believes that she will be kidnapped for the School for Good. Meanwhile, Agatha, who is ugly and wears only black, doesn’t believe the School exists but seems like the perfect candidate for the School for Evil. They are the two kids who are kidnapped by the School Master that year. However, Agatha is brought to the School for Good, and Sophie to the School for Evil. What first appears to be a great mistake turns into an adventure that not only reveals the character’s truest selves, but also blurs the lines between the stereotypes of good and evil.
Along the way, Sophie and Agatha meet the other students, who are descendants of fairytale characters. The best friends from Gavaldon take classes at their mismatched schools while they try to solve a riddle the School Master gave them that will lead them home. However, the School Master is more than what he seems, and has a different ending in store for Sophie and Agatha.
“The School for Good and Evil” is a very entertaining book, but the plot doesn’t go far beyond the school. Although this series takes place in a much larger world, the first book takes place only in Gavaldon and the School. The world of fairy tales is supposedly endless, but readers don’t get to experience much of this world in the first book. One must read the rest of the series to see more of this magical world of Good and Evil.
In “The School for Good and Evil,” nothing is as simple as it seems. It is a great read for those who like dramatic twists and sneaky foreshadowing in their books.

With the ongoing issue of Covid-19, everything from sports programs to theatre groups have had to make adjustments in order to ensure students’ safety. One such group is the Wind Ensemble, who have faced special challenges in resuming their rehearsals as students have returned to campus. 
The students and faculty of Wind Ensemble are no strangers to needing to adapt when it comes to the coronavirus, after dealing extensively with this issue last spring when campus was shut down. “Due to Zoom’s latency, it is impossible to play in time with each other” explained instrument performance music major (clarinet), Jacklyn Smith. “Instead, we spent the rest of the spring semester working on special projects,” said Smith. 
Professor McRoy, director of Wind Ensemble ensured the group was still able to make the most out of virtual learning. “We did a variety of different things,” said McRoy, “at the time we were working with a lot of music by composer Brian Balmages – preparing for our annual Band Festival when he would have been with us. In March-April, we did a deep dive on some of that music and did some analysis and other exploration.” 
In spite of their successful handling of the remote spring semester, students and faculty alike were grateful to be returning to in-person rehearsals. “After not having in-person rehearsals since early March, coming back to that environment is something I’ve really been looking forward to throughout these past few months” said Smith. This semester however, rehearsals will function differently than they ever have before, in order to ensure the group’s safety.
“We rehearse all spread out, six-plus feet apart…Percussionists wear gloves….Everyone has to use their own music stand. I wear a headset wireless mic broadcast through a speaker so everyone can hear me through my mask,” explained McRoy. 
Wind Ensemble has also had to deal with the added challenge of having woodwind and brass players, whose instruments require air flow in order to be played. Smith spoke about how these instrumentalists have found ways to play their instruments in a safe manner: “We made masks with a slit (so the mouthpiece fits through), and bell covers to further decrease the risk of contamination.”
 Even with masks, social distancing, gloves, and coverings on their instruments, Wind Ensemble has taken additional precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in their rehearsal space. “We rehearse for a period of time, then take a break for the air in our rehearsal hall to clean and change, then we return to continue to rehearse…There was a lot of scientific research done over the summer at the University of Colorado that we learned from on how to continue to make music in this environment,” explained McRoy, “It’s different, but it’s working.”
Now, the group is looking forward to what lays ahead for the remainder of the semester, including some virtual performances and events. “Right now, my plan is to record a performance in our rehearsal hall toward the middle of November – before Thanksgiving. We will then broadcast that via Zoom at a later date along with some interviews of students and perhaps some of the composers whose music we are preparing” said McRoy. This foresight and hardwork Professor McRoy has been putting into the group has not gone unappreciated by the students in the ensemble “[He] has worked extremely hard to ensure we have a wonderful and safe semester” said Smith.
With a successful method of holding safe rehearsals in place and some virtual events on the horizon, Wind Ensemble is excited for the rest of their semester of making music together, even if it’s done from six feet apart. “In rehearsal we talk openly about how great it is to be together doing what we love, and we also share openly what a challenge it is to do that in this environment. The key is to embrace it and not fight it. Turn every challenge into an opportunity to learn and grow” said McRoy.

The Scottish actor Sean Connery has died at age 90 in his sleep. His career spanned for seven decades and he was best known for his portrayal of James Bond. 
Connery became a top box-office star in both Britain and the United States in 1965 after starring in “From Russia With Love,” “Goldfinger” and “Thunderball.” He would go on to star in seven of the Bond series films. More than Agent 007, Connery went on to play a widower obsessed with a woman who is a compulsive thief in Alfred Hitchcock’s “Marnie” and as an amoral poet in the satire “A Fine Madness.”
Throughout his career he acted in more than 60 movies, leaving behind a legacy that many believe will last forever. 
“He was an amazing actor and his continuations to the medium are astounding,” Senior marketing major Anthony Cavarretta said. “He taught us how to play it cool as Mr. Bond and he is one of the main reasons Indiana Jones and the last crusade is my favorite movie of all time.” 
Connery died in the Bahamas, surrounded by loved ones after feeling unwell for some time according to his son, Jason Connery. Connery’s wife, Micheline Roquebrune, would later add that he had struggled with dementia before his passing. 
Senior arts management major Brianna Savarino said ”He was a super talented actor. Everyone knows the line, Bond, James Bond.”

Post is home to the inaugural class of the Positive Transitions to Work (PTW) program. The program is offered through Positive Behavior Support (PBS) Consultation in collaboration with the campus’ Center for Community Integration.
PTW is a two year program where college aged adults with developmental disabilities can learn vocational skills in a group of cohorts. The PTW program focuses on supporting independence and personal growth.
Students are exposed to six different career field options identified as important by the US Department of Labor; human Resources, business, communications, health, agriculture and manufacturing.
Though only in its inaugural year, the PTW program is being well received by students.
“I’m loving it so far. I learned that I appreciate not just writing but also there’s several other jobs people can take and how each of those jobs contribute to society whether low or high,” PTW student Victor Hoang said.
Hoang loves art, writing and fiction. 
”It’s a very calm, peaceful environment where we do group sessions and activities as a group, so that we’ll be given time to learn and develop,” Hoang said.
Hoang has been working towards the goal of providing for himself and his family through the PTW program.
“I wish to work independently and lead a more independent life, and also to help my mother make some money in order to live a fulfilling life, and in order to do that I need to learn how to work,” Hoang said.
Behind every student there is a mentor. Hoang’s mentor is Victoria Arias. Arias is part of Post’s early childhood education masters program.
”I just look forward to coming and hanging out with Victor. He’s given me some movie recommendations. We just learn more about each other everyday. It’s been a great experience, and meeting everyone else too has been fun,” Arias said.
Arias signed on to be a mentor for the PTW program in order to fulfill some hours needed for a course, but ended up staying for the experience.
“I had never worked with anyone with any developmental disabilities, I have some family members that have some disabilities, but this was the first time for me. This was for a class to get some hours, but honestly, I’ve done more than I ever had to for class just because I enjoy spending time here,” Arias said.
Arias says she learned confidence from Hoang. He is far more outgoing than her, while she is more of an introvert.
“I never really put myself out there to try new things, I never thought that I would be a mentor for anyone. I just think this is a great opportunity and I hope to continue,” Arias said.
The PTW program interviews less than half of the applicants they receive applications from, and accepts less than half of those interviewed. The program is selective, but this ensures the students coming in are ready to work.
One hope Arias and Hoang share for the PTW program is that the Post community would be more receptive to them. 
“I wish more people knew about the program and signed on to be a mentor and tried to include them in the community and be friends with them too,” Arias said.
Hoang wishes more people knew about the program, and signed up to be part of it as well. 
“I want them to know that if they know somebody that has a developmental disability of some sort. A young adult looking for a purpose in life, I recommend them coming here, where they can learn about themselves,” Hoang said.
Hoang encourages anyone on the Post campus to introduce themselves to any PTW student, they are looking to be a part of the campus community as well.For more information on the PTW program, visit https://www.positivebehavior.org/ptw.html.

LIU Post was offered a special opportunity to display President Lincoln’s only surviving handwritten draft of the emancipation Proclamation in the Tilles Center of Performing Arts at the “First Step to Freedom: Abraham Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation” exhibit. The final version of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863, was destroyed in a fire in Chicago in 1871. The draft is the only remaining copy, which led to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom of slaves. The New York State Legislature purchased the draft in 1865 days after Lincoln passed away.
LIU Post is the only Long Island exhibitor of this rare document while it goes on a state-wide tour to mark the 150thanniversary of one of the nation’s greatest accomplishments. LIU Post and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts are pleased and honored to join with the New York State Education Department and SUNY College of Old Westbury in presenting these national treasures to the community,» said Dr. Paul Forestell. Along with Lincoln’s draft, a speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the centennial anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation is also on display next to the draft. 
Students who have seen the historical document expressed their admiration for it. “I think it’s great we we’re able to see a part of history in the Tilles Center,” says Mitch Mark, senior Psychology major. “It’s almost like reliving a part of history and it’s really special.” Matt Aronberg, an Information Studies graduate student says, “It’s amazing how a piece of paper was able to change so much of our history and to make our country the way it is now.”
At the opening ceremony held in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall during Common Hour, Dr. Forestell, Dr. Steinberg, Dr. John B. King, Jr., Andrew P. Jackson and Robert Tilles reminded visitors that freedom and equality hasn’t been reached yet. Robert Tilles explains to those in attendance the segregation on Long Island. “We have pockets of poverty. We drove along the road between the high and low performing [school] districts, and you see people across the street here look at people across the street there saying, ‘how come they get the best education and how come we get the worst education?’”
Both historical documents were on display for the public with free admission on October 15 and 16 from1 pm to 9 pm. The exhibit was offered in partnership with LIU Post, LIU Votes and the Tilles Center of Performing Arts.

Now that summer is over and it is officially fall, it is time to put the shorts and flip-flops away. The change in weather means there is a change in the clothes we wear, the trends we see, and the drinks we find to be popular at Starbucks.
For those who try to stay fashion forward, it’s important to know what’s trendy this season. “Fall is the best time for fashion,” said Monica Peralta, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “It is just starting to cool down; you can layer, layer, and layer, without looking weather confused.”
“There are a lot of fun new trends this fall. Shift dresses, sock boots, pajama dressing, patchwork, and new Victorian pussy bows are the hottest trends right now,” said Stephanie Adelson Bray, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “This season we are seeing a lot of fringe, a lot of burgundy, and a lot of suede,” Peralta added.
“The color I’ve seen everywhere and a color that I really like is olive green,” said Jawaan Smith, a senior Arts Management major. “From pants to jackets, it’s a great color.” While there are new trends every season, some trends are timeless. Fringe, military style, layering, neutrals, velvet, and bohemian are just a few of the trends that will be carried over from years before, this fall, according to Bray.
Fashion for men tends to be overlooked, however, both Bray and Peralta made sure to include trends that men can totally rock this fall. “They should focus on layering,” Bray said. “3⁄4 zip sweaters, a button down under with a skinny scarf and a vest.”
“We are also seeing a lot of Monochrome happening,” Peralta added. “Which is super easy to pull off.”
Fall, to some, is also known as the season of pumpkin spice everything. Starbucks officially has their famous pumpkin spice latte back for the season. “I have yet to fall under the magical spell this pumpkin spice has put every girl in the world under,” Peralta said.
“Pumpkin spice kind of unofficially announces the beginning of the fall season,” Smith said. Bray agreed, but added, “Pumpkin spice isn’t bad, but I think there’s too much hype. A classic chai latte and caramel macchiato will do the job just fine,” she said.
To help those who don’t understand fashion trends, Bray and Peralta both gave some of their “must haves” for the season. The boyfriend jean, over the knee boots, plaid scarves, black booties, turtle neck sweaters, and duster coats are some of Peralta’s recommendations for women this season. Bucket bags, velvet booties, and fringe skirts are a few of Bray’s must haves this season.
For men, Peralta suggests: joggers, khaki denim, light denim, wool topcoats, chukka boots, bomber jackets, and brown leather sneakers. “Everyone must get their hands on a pair of beige Nike Air Max Thea Leather Sneakers and Adidas classic superstar sneakers,” said Bray. Smith suggests that everyone should own a pair of black jeans, colored pants (burgundy, navy, olive), and brown boots.
“Every season is a great season for fashion. You make it the way you want it to be,” Bray said. “There are limitless amount of options to wear in the fall. Personally, it’s my favorite time of the year to dress up.”

Halloween is only days away, and with all the excitement, you may have forgotten to get a killer costume, or make plans with your friends. Each year trends change and different costumes become popular, new haunted houses open along with different parties that attract people.
There are several events being held in the New York City to celebrate Halloween. This year’s events include:

Candle Light Ghost Tours of Manhattans Most Haunted House
Take a 50-minute tour of the Merchant’s House in Manhattan.

Magic
If Halloween wasn’t weird enough for you already, go to a magic show. Watch magicians pull rabbits and doves and my soul out from their hats! The magic shows will be taking place at The Players Theatre, located at 115 McDougal Street in the city. The show will run every Monday at 8 p.m. until Dec. 28. Tickets are $15.
Tickets for these events can be purchased online, if not free. These are just some of the things that you can enjoy this Halloween!

How many “selfies” does it take to settle on the “perfect” picture? How many times have you posted a “fire” picture onto social media, but your peers didn’t reciprocate (like the photo), so you deleted it? Although the players remain the same, the games and the rules of which the players play by, have changed ten-fold.
Once upon a time, well, really before all of these social media sites, we would look at each other on the Starbucks line, and make our judgments from there. However, “We now look at the person’s Instagram first, make our first judgment, and then we take it from there,” said senior history major, Kathy Rice. “I can name 1,000 times where some guy would like [my posts] on Instagram, I guess showing interest in
me, but then in person, no social contact, none whatsoever,” she added.
When Rice told me this story, I literally, “loled,” but this really is no laughing matter.
Let’s me ask you again, why does it take 200 pictures to get that one perfect selfie?! To be honest, folks, I think I have that answer. The mini photo shoot we partake in when we want to post a picture on social media is caused by something I would like to call, “Social Perfection,” a.k.a delusion.
I believe that social media is driving our youth to the brink of insanity as it causes them to feel the need to to “qualify” within their respective social groups. For example, Marcella Anteri, a Suffolk County High School physics teacher, recalled a story about one of her students and social media.
“One of my juniors, who will remain nameless, came to me at the end of class,” said Anteri. “That class, she did none of her physics homework, and totally bombed my quiz. She came to me, and before she could say anything, tears began pouring from her face.”
Anteri later revealed that her student’s disarray stemmed from her fear that she was being judged off of her social media posts. According to Anteri, her student told her, “I accidentally liked my friend’s ex-boyfriend’s picture, and they’ve been ignoring me all week.”
We all know being in high school can come with its times of social hardship to say the least, but if you think about it, social media just adds to that fire we deal with in our adolescent years. In the age of social media and texting, misinterpretation and cyberbullying have run rampant. It has led Mike Kurtz, a junior education major, across the street at NYIT to stop texting all together.
“You really wouldn’t believe how many fights [with friends] I’ve gotten into because I didn’t answer a text within three minutes, or reply ‘lol’ instead of replying ‘lmfao,’” Kurtz said. “I remember one time where a girl I was dating told me a joke, at which I replied [over text], ‘lol.’ She later texted saying, ‘I haven’t liked your attitude all day and that last text proves you’re giving me one right now.’”
“I never texted her back after that, because I knew where it was going to go,” said Kurtz. “If I have something to say, or want to talk to you then I’m just going to call you. I’m bringing back the phone call!”
Social media to me is a synthetic form of human interaction; a form of interaction, which in most cases that does us more harm than good. Yes, social media links us beyond the classroom and to each corner of the Earth; however, Instagram, Twitter, even Facebook, and Snapchat, have become portfolios, or as I’d like to call them, “baseball cards” to track our latest social undertakings, misleadingly presenting them to our peers.
Posting a picture of your lavish vacations, the new car, your selfie, taken from an angle that probably led you to sprain your wrist and shoulder, and not to mention your “following to followers ratio.” Social Media allows us to portray ourselves in our “best” light, and that’s great! What if social media just further enhances the saying “perception is reality,” in a world where everyone’s perception of each other is derived of social media. It makes me wonder if we are losing our authenticity, and that’s kind of scary. Well, too scary to me at least.

Nov. 14 was in many ways a Monday like no other. Still reeling from perhaps one of the most tumultuous, momentous and historic elections in the history of American politics, Post’s theatre majors began their weekly retreat back to the classroom.
However, most, if not all theatre majors attending the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building that day were shocked with inspiration when they saw what was waiting for them on the chalkboard in the west wing of the building.
An anonymous creator left a platform for theatre majors to put their dreams into writing, for all of campus to see. The creator has yet to claim responsibility for the mural.
“It’s a board where everyone can talk freely about anything,” said Sabrina Ali, a freshman theatre major, who also works as a receptionist in the department of theatre, dance & arts management. “It’s completely anonymous, it’s us being ourselves.”
With her hands folded, Ali gazed at the mural and said, “We want to be free, and this wall is our outlet.” According to Ali, the mural only began with the words ‘Before I Die, I want to…” and since then, this outlet has grown every day, consistently, by the hour, with each student and one dream at a time.
While Ali was speaking, three students passed by the mural and one contributed, writing what she wishes to accomplish before her time comes: “Make Mom and Dad Proud.”
The mural of motivation has no names, signatures, or any other form of identification. Regardless of whether it’s an image, quote, or simply just a word, this mural allows members of the student body to peacefully and properly display their thoughts, their emotions, and their perspective.
“We seem to learn a lot more about one another when we reveal ourselves to one another,” said Jacob Lackey, a freshman undeclared major. “I think the mural humanizes us, and in a digital world, we sometimes lose touch of that.”
With no plans to remove it, the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building mural currently remains untouched, located on the old chalkboard in the west wing of the building. Students who wish to view and/or contribute to the mural are welcome to do so as long as reverence is shown for classes that may be in attendance.

Former United States President, Bill Clinton spoke to a sold out audience at the Tilles Center on Thursday, Oct. 5.
The event, hosted by former U.S. Congressman Steve Israel and the LIU Global Institute, featured Clinton speaking for nearly an hour on topics including global issues, his wife’s presidential campaign, and the current White House administration.
The event then switched over to the Q & A session with Israel, focused on a number of important topics making news headlines today, such as gun violence, college debt, North Korea, and immigration.
Throughout the night, Clinton spoke about embracing our differences as Americans and working together. Our goal should be “to build more inclusive prosperity, more inclusive societies…and more inclusive politics,” Clinton said.
“In this age, you can build all the walls you want; we are still interconnected,” Clinton said. He stressed that it’s what brings people together that’s more important than the things that divide us.
Abraham Orenstein, a senior broadcasting major was one of the few LIU Post students who attended the event. He was impressed with the speech, although he described himself as a Sanders supporter. “I thought it was a really strong speech that focused on embracing our differences and coming together,” Orenstein said.
Clinton also spoke about the Electoral College which ultimately put Donald Trump in the presidency, although Hillary Clinton won popular vote. “Since I believe in democracy, I believe the person who gets the most votes should win,” he said.
The audience applauded when Clinton spoke about college affordability. “We should do whatever we can to have the maximum amount of people graduate debt-free,” he said, adding that our goal should be for every student from a non-rich family to get out of college without any debt.
On the topic of North Korea, Clinton said that North Korea’s Dictator, Kim Jong Un, has “done and said enough to be of grave concern.” However, Clinton admitted that he didn’t know much more about the current situation than what we read in the news. Clinton did however, caution our current administration, warning that we should know exactly what we are getting into before taking any action. The Trump administration should work with South Korea, China, Japan and Russia on handling North Korea, Clinton said. Israel asked Clinton what international challenge made him “toss and turn the most” during his presidency. “I was always worried about Osama Bin Laden and al- Qaida because he came from a wealthy family and he lived in a cave, which should tell you something – he believed what he was doing,” Clinton said.
Gun control, in light of the recent massacre in Las Vegas, was also discussed. “You do not need this to defend yourself,” Clinton stated about bump stocks, devices which allow semi-automatic weapons to mimic the ring speed of a fully automatic weapon. Clinton recommended “giving the voters the direct voice on this; they trust themselves more than they trust the politicians,” he said.
Michael Themistocleous, a 2017 Post alumnus who is the Tilles Center’s guest services manager, said that the Tilles Center staff worked with the Nassau County Police Department, the former president’s secret service, and the Old Brookville police to ensure everyone’s safety during the event. “I’m really happy about the Global Institute being a part of LIU. Steve Israel’s knowledge and connections can really enlighten everyone on campus, on both sides of the spectrum,” he said.
The Global Institute is partnering with the Hutton House for a book event on, “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign” by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. The event will be held in Lorber Hall on Oct. 25 at 1 p.m.

On Friday, Oct. 13, the day before Homecoming, students were surprised to find 25 new yellow bicycles spread out across the campus, with multiple bikes chained to bike racks in front of Post Hall, Brookville Hall, the library, and between Nassau and Suffolk Halls.
Students received an email from President Kimberly Cline later that day, explaining that the new bikes had many uses, “whether it is rushing to your next class or squeezing in a quick workout.”
Students were expected to follow an “honor code,” according to the president’s email. Students were given the code “1954,” to unlock bike chains and to use the bikes at their own pleasure on campus, free of charge. Unfortunately, within days of their introduction to the campus, bikes were missing or damaged. Some bikes were hidden around campus, or taken into buildings and rooms to keep other students from being able to ride them. Another instance that occurred included the use of a personal lock to chain the campus bike.
Scott Carlin, the director of Center for Sustainability, is delighted that the administration offered on-campus bicycles to students.
Several years ago, students in the department of Earth and environmental science explored several alternative bicycle options for the campus. “Student research included working with third-party companies that manage and maintain the bicycles, [create] bicycle paths on the campus, and working to make sure that bicycles, pedestrians, and cars can share the campus safely,” Carlin said.
Carlin went on to say that it is not unusual for new bike programs to experience growing pains, and posed the same questions many students are asking. Should students be able to borrow bicycles anonymously or should they need an ID to borrow them? What happens with at tires and other maintenance issues? Who will be responsible?
Campus Life did not comment on the misconduct with bikes on campus. “We are excited to hear the initial feedback about the bike program. Students have been riding bikes around campus and we are happy that the program has been such a success,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said in an email. His email goes on to state, “As with any new program, we are constantly evaluating to determine future improvements and enhancements.
Students who have feedback regarding the program are encouraged to contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299-2800.”

In “Smite,” we are introduced to Ullr: The Glorious One. In the game, Ullr is designed in heavy robes and a hood, he also wears a bow and arrow and his twin axes. As a hunter god that lives in the frigid north, this design could not be more fitting.

There are many gods in Norse mythology, but few are as highly regarded as Ullr, “The Hunter God of Glory.” In both mythology and in “Smite,” Ullr doesn’t represent the boastfulness or shameful satisfaction one gets from seeing others fall. He is honorable and pays respect to true glory in all its forms.
For Ullr, glory is in the silence of snow fall, the perfect curve of a bow firing an arrow, the honorable victory earned in single combat and the moment of life’s rebirth. In Norse mythology, “The Hunter God of Glory” is an enigma ever keeping to himself. In “Smite,” Ullr is secretive and knows that true glory lies in remote hideaways, untouched by the hands of time, and it is in these very hideaways the shrines to Ullr can be found.
Ullr is highly respected even among the gods, for it his him and not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the all father is away. While other gods would abuse the power the throne brings, Ullr knows that his rule is an extension of Odin’s will.
The mythology states that Ullr is a skilled archer and an expert in close combat; this is no different in “Smite.” In the game, Ullr’s attacks and abilities revolve around his skills as a hunter. His passive ability is called weapons master; this allows Ullr to switch between fighting with his bow and his axes, and it is here that we see Ullr’s true skills. With his bow, Ullr’s abilities allow him to attack multiple
enemies at once while his axe-based abilities are for single combat.
Ullr’s second ability is called expose weakness. This allows Ullr to land critical hits easily. Just as his mythology counterpart finds glory in a bow firing an arrow true, Smite’s Ullr is able to find the perfect shot without hesitation.
Ullr’s ultimate is called Wield Axes; with this Ullr gains additional physical strength and lifesteal which allows him to deal more damage to a single enemy. This ties in to his mythology as it tells how Ullr finds honor in single combat and pays respect to his fallen foe.
While not much is known about Ullr, “Smite” does a good job of paying respect to his mythology and gives us a character that is both accurate and fun to play with.

Now that summer is over and it is officially fall, it is time to put the shorts and flip-flops away. The change in weather means there is a change in the clothes we wear, the trends we see, and the drinks we find to be popular at Starbucks.
For those who try to stay fashion forward, it’s important to know what’s trendy this season. “Fall is the best time for fashion,” said Monica Peralta, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “It is just starting to cool down; you can layer, layer, and layer, without looking weather confused.”
“There are a lot of fun new trends this fall. Shift dresses, sock boots, pajama dressing, patchwork, and new Victorian pussy bows are the hottest trends right now,” said Stephanie Adelson Bray, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “This season we are seeing a lot of fringe, a lot of burgundy, and a lot of suede,” Peralta added.
“The color I’ve seen everywhere and a color that I really like is olive green,” said Jawaan Smith, a senior Arts Management major. “From pants to jackets, it’s a great color.” While there are new trends every season, some trends are timeless. Fringe, military style, layering, neutrals, velvet, and bohemian are just a few of the trends that will be carried over from years before, this fall, according to Bray.
Fashion for men tends to be overlooked, however, both Bray and Peralta made sure to include trends that men can totally rock this fall. “They should focus on layering,” Bray said. “3⁄4 zip sweaters, a button down under with a skinny scarf and a vest.”
“We are also seeing a lot of Monochrome happening,” Peralta added. “Which is super easy to pull off.”
Fall, to some, is also known as the season of pumpkin spice everything. Starbucks officially has their famous pumpkin spice latte back for the season. “I have yet to fall under the magical spell this pumpkin spice has put every girl in the world under,” Peralta said.
“Pumpkin spice kind of unofficially announces the beginning of the fall season,” Smith said. Bray agreed, but added, “Pumpkin spice isn’t bad, but I think there’s too much hype. A classic chai latte and caramel macchiato will do the job just fine,” she said.
To help those who don’t understand fashion trends, Bray and Peralta both gave some of their “must haves” for the season. The boyfriend jean, over the knee boots, plaid scarves, black booties, turtle neck sweaters, and duster coats are some of Peralta’s recommendations for women this season. Bucket bags, velvet booties, and fringe skirts are a few of Bray’s must haves this season.
For men, Peralta suggests: joggers, khaki denim, light denim, wool topcoats, chukka boots, bomber jackets, and brown leather sneakers. “Everyone must get their hands on a pair of beige Nike Air Max Thea Leather Sneakers and Adidas classic superstar sneakers,” said Bray. Smith suggests that everyone should own a pair of black jeans, colored pants (burgundy, navy, olive), and brown boots.
“Every season is a great season for fashion. You make it the way you want it to be,” Bray said. “There are limitless amount of options to wear in the fall. Personally, it’s my favorite time of the year to dress up.”
