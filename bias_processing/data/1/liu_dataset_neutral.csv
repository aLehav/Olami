This fall season the Student Health and Counseling Center is offering flu shots for all C.W. Post students 18 and over. The vaccinations have been available since October 1st and will continue for as long as supplies last. Students must fill out a release and proof of age to receive the 12 dollar shot.
“We’re charging what we pay. We don’t make any money,” explained Bill Milford, the Director of Student Health and Counseling. “Our objective is to make sure the students who want it can get it.”
The true flu season spans from November to February, but the Health Center is getting a jump on the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people with health risks get the flu vaccine in October. All healthy citizens are urged to get it in November.
The Health Center will conduct a traveling flu shot clinic in early November. The clinic will visit the Winnick Student Center and Hillwood Commons during Common Hour to give the injections.
Students who are squeamish around needles are in luck. There is a variation of the syringe that pushes the vaccination through the skin using carbon dioxide. “It’s not like a booster shot where it hurts afterwards” said Nurse Sylvia Barton. She went on to add, “You’re going to feel something or there’s something wrong with your neurological system.” According to the waiver, the side effects to the flu shot are “tenderness at the site of injection, fever, chills, headaches or muscular aches.”
The Center will begin Flu Prevention week on October 25th. Later this month, the Center will have a depression screening on October 7th, Alcohol Awareness Day on the 12th and Domestic Violence Prevention Day on the 19th.
Along with the flu shot, the Health Center provides the C.W. Post community with primary medical care, a gynecologist, free counseling sessions, nutritional guidance and much more. Also offered is blood testing for all sexually transmitted diseases. “If you’re sexually active, you should know where you stand,” Barton said.
The Student Health and Counseling Center is located in room 154 of the Life Science Building and is open from 8am to 8pm during the semester.

Letter to the readers,
Not only is the season changing, there ís a new air on campus.  It’s not that fresh cool breeze that slips through your window screens at night either.  Students are a little rambunctious and more energetic than usual this week.  You might have even seen some familiar faces- former students or faculty (cough, cough alumni.)  The athletic teams, especially the football team, have more adrenaline pumping through their veins because this is just any weekend for Post.  It’s Homecoming weekend!!
This is the one weekend that current and past Postonians take the most pride in. Essentially it’s the one time of the year when the entire school really comes together.  Students gather at the pep rally on Friday night.  The residence halls compete for the best and most creative skit, athletic teams are introduced for the seasons, a DJ provides the music and suddenly you are caught up with the crowd that’s singing some song you don’t even know.  But you sure as hell are having a fun time!  Then Saturday comes and everyone watches the football game on Hickox field.  There’s tailgating in the Pratt parking lot, families of students come from all over the states, alumni return to play in athletic games or just to come and enjoy the day with their alma mater!
If you’re a freshmen, than you have to experience this for yourself.  Trust us, this is not an event to miss at Post.  But before we get too carried away, lets introduce the sixth edition of our student newspaper.  Many interesting articles this week; one focuses on the increase of tuition, while one of our editors discusses the two primary candidates for New York governor.  In sports, both the boys and girls cross-country teams traveled to sunny Florida and came back with a few record-breaking times.
As for our arts and entertainment section of Loomings, we are still looking for anyone interested in writing book, movie or game reviews.  Please email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.comÖdonít forget, we are still looking for that 50th email to give away that $500 prize!
From your staff of the Pioneer, Happy Homecoming and good luck Pioneers!

1. It would be cool if you guys can take pictures ofr random students around campus. I know  I would feel good seeing myself in the paperhave a good feeling to see myself in a paper. It creates some sort of a celeb/student status – . kinda like  make an on campus gossip section. I don’t know, it’s just an idea. The 1st edition was great, like all the rest and near future printed papers. Real professional!
Peace

2. Hi Pioneer staff,
If I could change things I’d have articles based more on world news, not just issues that effect the average frat boy. Many students aren’t aware of activities on campus, so doing articles on those clubs might be a good idea at the beginning of the year. However, more detailed articles on our government and current events would be great. Also, while I feel like it’s important that the arts section be expanded and worked upon, the combination of Loomings and the paper is a poor choice. The magazine was beautiful and the picture quality suffers when artwork is printed on newsprint. There is also even less attention on the arts on campus now that there is no publication. It’s too bad that Loomings is understaffed.
Thanks.
Sincerely,
E. Amaral
3. Hello,
I would like to see recaps of professional sports teams in the newspaper. Something about the Jets, Giants, N baseball teams, basketball teams, etc. I think it would be a nice touch to the paper and would grab a bigger audience.
Ps: Tthis is Ppaul from broadcast 25 and I told you I would e-mail you!

4. I would like to see more movie reviews in the paper!

5. To “The Pioneer”,
Hello. Recently I read the first the first issue of The Pioneer and saw the ad in the back about “what you’d like to see”; so here I go! I am a currently enrolled Art student at the C.W. Post campus. I would love to do a comic strip per issue of the newspaper on campus life, commuter life and general college life. I think readers would really enjoy “seeing” this in their campus paper. I plan on making it some-what humorous and personal to the school. Please let me know if this is a possibility and I will send some comic strip ideas. Also, if there is ever any need for illustrations or photographs I would love to get involved with that too. 
Thank you for your time!

6. Im just worried that maybe im so late to send this email 😀
I like the Pioneer a lot. It gives me a lot of opportunities.
To be honest, I know the Pioneer recently because I am an international students and also I did not pay attention to what is going on to the school hahahaha
however, i had a change to be interviewed during the chuseok story.
It was the first time to be in an article and i was so happy with my friends hahaha and we all laughed at my picture.
As an international student, it is easier to read the Pioneer because it is easy to relate to in comparison to the new york times.
In addition, if the Pioneer will add articles about the International students, a lot of them will pay attention! at least I hope so!

Coming off a tough overtime loss to first place St. Thomas Aquinas College by a score of 2-1, the Pioneers came out focused and determined for their next games at Molloy College (3-11) and Mercy College (6-6-2).
C.W. Post won in a 4-1 rout against the last-place Molloy Lions. Later on in the week, the Pioneers faced off against Mercy College (6-6-2), but lost in an exciting double overtime match-up.
“We played well both games,” said forward Rumen Kerekov. “We scored five goals in total in those games and we created many chances. Against Molloy we won convincingly, but we lost in a very unfortunate way to Mercy.”
Right from the start of the game against Molloy, the Pioneers came out energized and ready to play. The Pioneers scored two goals in the first half; one scored by freshman back Joakim Ohlson, and the other by junior midfielder David Carlsson. After these quick two goals, neither team would put up a point on the scoreboard until Molloy’s Dan Brown beat C.W. Post goalie Marco Jorgensen to make the score 2-1 in favor of Post.
Just five minutes after Molloy finally found their offense and came within one goal of tying the game, Carlsson scored his second goal of the game, and his fourth goal of the season. Post continued to pour it on when senior forward Emanuel Messina found the back of the net off a pass from Carlsson to put the game out of reach at a score of 4-1.
On Saturday, the Pioneers traveled to face Mercy College in an East Coast Conference showdown. Post took the early lead on a goal from sophomore forward Betim Bajrami, with the assist coming from Carlsson. Midway through the second half, Mercy would even up the score off a goal from Alex Cruz.
Both teams could not end the game in regulation, so overtime was needed. Neither team could find a way to win at the conclusion of the first overtime, so yet another extra period was needed. In the 104th minute, Cruz managed to give Mercy the lead on his second goal of the game, as this proved to be the final score of a thrilling battle with the Pioneers on the losing end.
“It was a tough loss, but we can still qualify for the playoffs if we beat Queens next Saturday,’ said Kerekov. “So we will definitely be pumped up for that game.”
The Pioneers next game will be at home against Nyack College (5-5) on Thursday at 2 p.m. Saturday, will be their last regular season game, which will be at home against Queens College at 2:30 p.m.

The C.W. Post Pioneers will not extend their season past this weekend. Post will not be involved in a PSAC Championship game. There will be no playoffs. And while the Pioneers outscored the Cheyney Wolves last week, the team may have proven why it won’t be in the postseason.
Cheyney is one of the worst teams in Division II. The team hasn’t had a winning season since 1979. Going back to 1995, the Wolves have a cumulative record of 8-161-1. Out of 151 Division II teams, the Wolves have the 134th offense. Any team should be able to stop their offense.
Go back to last week’s game. The Pioneers defeat the Wolves 63-28. Sure nine touchdowns on offense is a great stat but the defense gave up four. One of the problems with the Pioneers this year is the players’ demeanor on defense. There is no consistency from game to game. One week, the defense is all-world. The next, the squad surrenders points and puts the burden on the offense’s shoulders.
So many times this year, the Pioneers have given up easy yards. For the most part, they have been unable to stop their opponent’s rushing attack. This past week against one of the worst offenses in the nation, the Pioneers watched Cheyney run for 314 yards. Through 10 games, the Pioneers have given up 174 rushing yards per game.
Clearly that type of defense is not conducive of a playoff team. There have been so many instances this season where the defense should have or needed to come up big but fell short. As Coach Bryan Collins always points out to me, football has three phases. And while the offense has done well fighting through injuries, the special teams working through its own issues, the defense has not.
Regardless, there is room to grow for C.W. Post. The defense is full of young players. Donovan Edwards has started at cornerback as a true freshman. Sean Smith was having an excellent year before his knee injury and the vast majority of the starting defense will return next year.
But with one more game left against a solid slippery rock team, the Pioneers have an opportunity to reach seven wins and improve their record from last season. They’ll be in line to win as long as they can play a shutdown defense.

NFL
The New York Giants took on their arch-rival Dallas Cowboys at home, falling to the desperate ‘boys 33-20. Under new head coach Jason Garrett, Dallas (2-7) displayed grit and determination against a flat Giants team. New York (6-3) looks to rebound next week in Philadelphia against the Eagles.
The New York Jets recorded their second consecutive week with an overtime win over the Cleveland Browns. The Jets escaped last week’s game against the Lions with a comeback in the final minutes of regulation and quick field goal in overtime. This week was quite similar, with Santonio Holmes making a deciding catch in overtime, however this week taking it in for the score. The Jets face off against the Houston Texans on Sunday at the Meadowlands.
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick and company trounced the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football 59-28.

Have you ever considered where graduate students were living this semester? How about the number of graduate students actually dorming? Jennifer Fuoco, the director of residence life, has informed the Pioneer that there are currently 92 graduate students living on campus and that the total number of graduate students living on campus has changed over the years. Fuoco added that, “This number has changed from year to year and is currently up by six from last year at this time.”
Various factors can determine why most graduate students choose to live off-campus.  Sean Manning, a graduate student studying medical microbiology said that “since [he] lives near the school, he doesn’t see the point in living on campus.” Jessica Blumenthal, a graduate student studying social work, agreed with Manning. Blumenthal said that she doesn’t live on campus because she “lives 30 minutes from the school, so for me, it is not worth paying for housing on campus when I can live at home for free.” Although their reasons seem plausible, living on campus can also have its advantages.
Blumenthal went on to say,  “During my undergrad., I was in Maryland and paid for housing, both in dorms and in an apartment, so I already had the experience of living somewhere else.”
The director of residence life also provided a tentative explanation as to why graduate students choose to live on campus. Fuoco said, “living on campus seems to appeal most to graduate students who are enrolling in graduate coursework immediately after finishing their Bachelor’s degrees.  For students who have been out of the residence halls and away from campus life for a year or more, the idea of living in a residence hall, having a roommate, and sharing a community bathroom may no longer be something that works with their lifestyles or schedules.  Some graduate students are also completing their coursework while working full-time and may choose to live closer to their workplace.”
Though living off-campus may be suitable for someone seeking a different experience of being in another environment that is more private and confined, few graduate students agree that living on campus can be an advantage. A graduate student, who wished to remain anonymous, said that when “you live on campus, [you] meet a lot of people and don’t have to deal with all the traffic of commuting, and you get more involved with school related activities. And, living on campus also allows you to work.”
As you can see, there are many things that can influence a person’s choice in deciding whether to dorm or not.  One can agree that graduate students, although one may  think there are none on campus, do make up a significant percentage of the student population on campus. If you still unsure about whom the graduate students are, try networking through the residence halls; you bound to come across a graduate student more quickly than you would think.

C.W. Post students were able to express their Post pride with a Pep Rally on Friday, October 21st, at 7 p.m. in the gym of the Pratt Recreation Center. Sponsored by The Association for Campus Planning (ACP), the Pep Rally had a number of events for students to enjoy.
The night included the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners of the talent show giving an encore of their winning performances. Homecoming banners were proudly displayed, clubs were acknowledged, and the Student Dance Association and Pioneerettes dazzled the crowd with their own performances. And, last but not least, students showed their Post pride to the football team before the big homecoming game. What’s not to love about pep rally?
In addition to the performances, there were also free food and drinks offered to the crowd, along with some green and gold pompoms and foam fingers to cheer with. And, ACP didn’t stop there. It also threw free C.W. Post t-shirts into the crowd and had a D.J. blasting music throughout the event to keep the students pumped up.
Sally-Ann Gaughan, a junior early childhood education major, was surprised by this year’s pep rally. “It was better than I thought it would be. It had more school spirit. It was just awesome.”
Anna Smith, a freshman with an undeclared major, also enjoyed pep rally, saying, “I liked it and thought it was really good. The music was also really good, too.”
This year’s Pep Rally did just what it set out to do: get students pumped up for the big Homecoming game, and allow them to let loose and have some fun.

Conversations Helping and Teaching Stu¬dents, C.H.A.T.S., a program created in 2009, is in the process of becoming an official club at LIU Post. In C.H.A.T.S., an American student and an international student are paired as partners so the two can learn about each other’s cultures and become friends. This gives the internationals students the opportunity to improve and practice their English. 
The offices of International Student Services and Religious Life created C.H.A.T.S. in 2009 and act as co-sponsors for the organization. This semester, C.H.A.T.S. has begun the process of becoming an official club by creating an executive board and attending three Student Government Association meetings. The new executive board consists of five students: Alize Margulis, Rika Tatsukawa, Arti Jain, Terry Chang and Serena Oditt, who will attend the Student Government Association meetings to represent C.H.A.T.S. Father Ted, who is in charge of the Newman Catholic Club, and Jeanette Murray, who works at International Students Services, advise the students. Three coordinators oversee the organization Murray, as well as Trica Figuero and Dr. Leslie Bai. 
“Make another friend; you always need a friend,” said Figuero. C.H.A.T.S. was created to try to build up the connection between international and Americans students. It also serves to improve international students’ command of the English language, allow international students to learn more about American culture, and permit American students to learn about different cultures. This may lead to inviting their partner home for Thanksgiving, and even visiting their partner’s country, said Bai. “International students feel intimidated and lonely. If they find someone who knows American life, they can meet through C.H.A.T.S. first and then become friends later on their own,” said Bai. 
All the C.H.A.T.S. partners are the same gender and are partners for one year. The partners usually meet once a week for about an hour. When, where, what you do and for how long you meet are entirely up to you and your partner. There are also monthly group events for everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. One of the first events this semester was International Friendship Night, which was held on September 20 in the Chapel. The event consisted of games, dancing, food and international trivia. The next event is a presentation on exploring New York on October 11 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. There is an Inter¬national Education Week Dinner planned for November 12 at 7 in the Tilles Center and a farewell party on December 6 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. “The events are open to everyone. We are always encouraging and welcoming visitors and new members, if interested,” said Bai. 
There is an application form which helps with the pairing process. Students fill out their major, hobbies and if they have a preference of what type partner they would like, said Bai. She said last fall there were 50 pairs, last spring there were 39 pairs, and there are currently 27 pairs. However, students join throughout the semester. Students, faculty and staff are all members of C.H.A.T.S. The staff members who are involved in C.H.A.T.S. are Trica Figuero, Dr. Leslie Bai, Jeanette Murray and Nadia Hernandez, who all work at International Students Services. 
“The biggest headache now is there are always more international students then American students,” said Bai. Many international students are waiting for a partner. Bai said new international students are their first priority but returning international students are also waiting. There is a lack of male American students. Many American students are needed and males are needed the most right now, said Figuero. “We have included staff members, and some domestic students take two partners,” said Figuero, to try to solve the problem of not having enough American members. “We try to recruit students at (club) fairs, but it is always hard to get them to commit,” said Bai. 
Bai said many show interest in C.H.A.T.S. while they are recruiting but then they say they are too busy. “Some people are afraid of the commitment; time is an issue,” said Figuero. The coordinators say the group meeting and weekly partner meetings are not mandatory. The events are held so that everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. can get together and do some sort of activity. As long as you are spending individual time with your partner, you do not have to attend the events. C.H.A.T.S. is extremely flexible. “It’s not something to be fearful of or stress out about; just try it” said Figuero. They said they want more American students to learn from this experience. “You don’t have to do something extra; you can bring your partner to something you go to already,” said Bai. 
Being a member of C.H.A.T.S., and acquiring knowledge about another culture, will enhance your resume and work experience as well, said Figuero. Clubs can also pick up partners. Every club on campus has to do a certain amount of hours of community service and earn points for it. If you are on another club on campus and need to earn community service points, you can earn them by joining C.H.A.T.S. If there are a few partners per club, they will give you about half of the points needed. “Internationalization, we want more students to open up, even make our campus a little different,” said Figuero. 
Rika Tatsukawa, a senior Public Relations major from Japan, has been a member of C.H.A.T.S. since September 2011. Tatsukawa was partners with Arti Jain, a junior English Education major, last year. The partners are continuing to work together through C.H.A.T.S. this year as well. “At first, I didn’t expect her to be such a good friend and now I can’t image campus life without her,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she meets, texts and messages her partner often. “I meet Arti at her house a lot, her mother makes Indian food which I love,” said Tatsukawa. She said she went to her C.H.A.T.S. partner’s house for Thanksgiving, her birthday and Christmas. She also said she has met most of her family. “Now I don’t think of her as a partner; I just think of her as one of my friends,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she and Arti have similar feelings to be kind to others and common sense. 
Taksukawa said that C.H.A.T.S. has made her more compassionate to others, especially foreigners. “If I go back to Japan and see foreigners, I want to take care of them and help them because now I know how they feel. Taksukawa thinks that American and inter¬national students can learn a lot from each other. “I wish American students can learn from International students. In the future, it can help them with their work if they know that culture,” said Taksukawa. She said she taught her partner how to say hello in Japanese, “Konnichiwa,” and thank you, “Arigato.” 
Alize Margulis, a junior International Studies major has been part of C.H.A.T.S. since she was a freshman. “I joined C.H.A.T.S. because I thought it was the best way to learn about other cultures and customs,” said Margulis. Her first C.H.A.T.S. partner was Winny Wang, a graduate student from China studying Science Research. She said she found similarities between Wang’s culture and her own. “Winny almost always boils water and drinks the water as such; whereas I would boil water but I would drink it only if I had diffused a tea bag,” said Marguilis.
Last year, Marguilis and her former partner, Kotona Uzumaki, a Business major from Japan, were C.H.A.T.S ambassadors. “We spoke at various C.H.A.T.S. events and were nominated and received certification for Outstanding C.H.A.T.S. Partners of the Year 2012,” said Marguilis. She said her past two partners have become her really close friends. “Kotona, who was studying abroad in the U.S. for one year was in two of my classes , and once we became C.H.A.T.S. partners, we went to various club events on campus and explored off campus too,” said Marguilis. She said she feels she taught her partner how to be comfortable in her home when inviting her over for holidays and dinner. Marguilis said her two past partners taught her many phrases in Chinese and Japanese. She said she and Uzumaki would see shows in the city and at the Tilles Center as well as spend time in her neighborhood. Marguilis still keeps in contact both of her C.H.A.T.S. partners through Skype and e-mail. “I’m hoping to travel to Asia one day, so I know I will be able to explore their countries with them too!” she said.
This year Marguilis is partnered with a student from China named Shuai Shuai, but she has not met her yet. She said she wishes more American students joined C.H.A.T.S. “LIU Post provides this opportunity through the C.H.A.T.S. program, but I feel not enough domestic students are committed or interested in becoming a partner. I understand many students have busy agendas, but how complicated is it to take one hour per week out of your time to meet with some one?” said Marguilis.
She said she has truly enjoyed her experience as a member of C.H.A.T.S. “Inter¬national friends have certain values that we as Americans don’t. I am not bashing Americans, but we should embrace other cultures and be open to learning about them, especially in this globalized business world that we live in today,” said Marguilis.

The LIU Post football team ended its four-game losing streak by defeating the Millersville Marauders (2-6) on Homecoming by a final score of 20-15. Sophomore quarterback Tyler Heuer started in place of injured sophomore quarterback Steven Laurino, and helped lead the team to a much needed win in front of a packed house at Hickox Field on Saturday, October 20.
The Pioneers (3-4) had no trouble putting up points through the first 30 minutes of play as the team led 20-6 at the half. The highlight of the day took place early in the first quarter when Heuer jump-started the offense with an 82-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Kamron Palmer. Following an interception by senior defensive back D.J. Young, Heuer and the offense were put in great starting field position to do some damage at the Millersville 29 yard line. Senior running back Thomas Beverly capped off the drive with a one-yard touchdown run for his second rushing touchdown of the season.
The Pioneers finally got off to a solid start like Coach Bryan Collins has preached all season long. However, on the first play of Millersville’s ensuing drive, junior running back Ian Sadon busted out a 75-yard touchdown run make the score 13-6 in favor of the Pioneers early in the second quarter.
The Pioneers once again capitalized on Millersville turnovers. Junior outside linebacker Tommy Williams intercepted a pass and nearly ran it the distance for a touchdown. The offense of the Pioneers needed only one play to take a two score advantage as junior linebacker Rob Bright barreled his way into the end zone for a touchdown. With that score, the Pioneers had a comfortable 20-6 lead at the break.
In the second half, Heuer and the offense did not show up as the team did not even threaten to score once during the final 30 minutes. The Pioneers’ defense came up clutch on Homecoming as it forced four turnovers and limited the Marauders to only 15 points all game. Sophomore defensive lineman Joseph Thompson was a game-changer as he led the Pioneers with two sacks, while senior linebacker Anton Rukaj had a team-high 10 tackles.
With the defense playing so well, the offense had to hold onto the ball to avoid the Pioneers losing the fifth straight game. Late in the fourth quarter after throwing his second interception of the quarter and third of the game, Heuer was pulled in favor of Laurino. For the game, Heuer was 11-20 for 113 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions through the air. However, Heuer was efficient on the ground rushing the ball 19 times for 137 yards. With less than four minutes left to play, Laurino entered the game with a broken left hand and a broken right thumb ready to close out a Pioneers win. And he did just that. Despite not throwing the ball once, Laurino had three rushes for 11 yards, protected the ball, and moved the chains to seal a Pioneers win on Homecoming.
The Pioneers have the team’s final home game this week on Saturday, October 27, at 1 p.m. when they square off against the 3-4 East Stroudsburg Warriors.

After 13 months of campaigning, rallying, and debating, Barack Obama will begin his second term in the White House. Although he beat former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in a landslide in electoral votes, he was not as popular amongst all Americans.
According to A CNN article published this month, “Obama takes key battlegrounds to win re-election” by Tom Cohen, Obama won all battleground states as well as Romney’s birthplace of Michigan and his governing state of Massachusetts, with 332 electoral votes. Romney won 206 electoral votes.  Obama needed only 270 electoral votes to win the election. But, Obama did not win the popular vote with such a wide margin. According to the BBC U.S. 2012 results, 50.5 percent of the country voted for Obama while 47.9 voted for Romney, leaving the nation divided.
In Chicago, Obama supporters roared and cheered once Obama’s victory was announced, while television networks showed coverage of Romney supporters somber and crying. Republicans still had hope since Fox News Analyst Karl Rove had reported that Romney might still have a chance in winning Ohio. Shortly after Obama won the battleground state. After Romney’s concession speech, one Romney supporter stated that the fact that Romney lost was “a tough pill to swallow.”
A new Romney appeared on stage, less aggressive and more somber than we’ve seen him in the past months. An hour after news networks projected Barack Obama as victor, in Boston, Romney, whose eyes appeared to be red and watery, conceded, “I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation. The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing. I believe in America, I believe in the people of America.”
In Barack Obama’s acceptance speech, he stated, “Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs – not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together…..We’ve got more work to do.”
Changes promised for students under Obama’s Presidency:
Student debt has reached $1 trillion for the fist time in history. Students will begin to see Obama’s Pay as You Earn program reiterated on certain websites where students can apply for loans. The Pay as You Earn program, which will be in effect in 2013-2014, caps monthly federal student loan repayment at 10 percent of one’s monthly income. This is so students have more money to spend and invest in the economy, according to Barackobama.com. Also, under this program, a student can choose the college they want to attend based on their career goals and not solely on the price of tuition. In addition, if one pays their federal loans on time and at least at 10 percent of your monthly income as a teacher, service person, or doctor, one will be forgiven of federal loans after 10 years. For all other professions, if loans are paid responsibly, one will be forgiven in 20 years.
The Know Before You Owe program is a form that includes loan interest rates while differentiating between grants and scholarships, showing students exactly what they will be paying, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the U.S. Department of Education. The form would also be introduced as a universal Financial Aid document that all colleges would be urged to adopt by the 2013-14 school year. This would allow students to see what they are being offered and how much they could possibly pay, before they accept the offer to attend that school. President Obama also insured that veterans and service members would be able to get a college education and find work when they return from service by implementing and expanded the post-9/11 G.I. Bill, according to BarackObama.com.
He also proposes to make higher education institutions more affordable, even though a written bill has yet to be written out and plans lack details, according to “With Obama’s Win, Colleges Anticipate 4 More Years of Reform,” by Michael Stratford in Chronicle.com this month. According to WhiteHouse.gov, the official website of the White House, Obama stated, “Higher education is not a luxury. Earning a postsecondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs.”
The President will be inaugurated for his second term on January 21, 2013 in Washington D.C.

	Hurricane Sandy and the nor’easter that followed caused LIU Post to close for a total of 11 days, including weekends. In order for students to complete their fall 2012 courses in full satisfaction with the New York State Education Department requirements, missed classes will have to be made up, according to Beth Carson, who works in Registrar. 
	New York State mandates a specific amount of contact (instruction) hours, explains Carson. For a three credit course, there must be 2,250 minutes of contact hours not including out of class work.
	The rest of the fall semester’s academic calendar has been revised as well. Make-up classes for the hurricane will be scheduled on Fridays, Saturdays and during common hour. It will be up to the professor to determine which days and times will be used. Wednesday, December 12, will be a mandatory make-up day for classes. 
	Classes that were cancelled due to the nor’easter will be made up as follows: evening classes cancelled Wednesday, November 7, will be made up on Saturday, December 15. Classes that were cancelled on Thursday, November 8 (2pm and later), will be made up on Thursday, December 13. Classes that were cancelled on Friday, November 9, will be made up on Friday, December 14. Faculty will be responsible to confirm all make-up sessions, times and locations with their students.  
	Final exams will now be held from Monday, December 17, until Friday, December 21. 
	The extra classes have been reported to add stress on some students. Jacob Maitland, junior business major, said, “I’ve had two rescheduled classes and one that really did me in.” Because of some scheduling issues, his parents are visiting him the week after Thanksgiving instead of during the break. His law class was rescheduled for a Saturday when his parents would be visiting. He said he reacted with “a lot of beeps, hash tags and stars.” The class is also expecting an exam that day. Maitland said that it was too personal to reveal his professor’s name; however, the professor allowed him to reschedule the exam for a later date so he could spend the extra time with his parents. 
	“Students should speak with faculty regarding any conflicts that they have with scheduled make-up classes,” Carson said. She added that if there are additional concerns made by the student that cannot be resolved by the faculty then they should speak with their chairperson or dean. 
Some students understand the need to make-up classes. “It was a whole entire week of classes, that’s a lot of days missed,” said Joe Nicastro, junior criminal justice major. He added that it’s better than extending the semester. 
	Natalie Post, freshman finance business major, said, “Mine didn’t bother me, but if I had a Friday class, I might be mad.” She normally works during common hour and did not mind missing one day of work but still referred to it as money coming out of her pocket. 
Softball players Kaci Hopkins and Nicole Hagenan, both criminal justice majors, were relieved that they did not have any rescheduled classes that interfered with practice. Their Earth Science class was rescheduled for common hour. “I’d rather have it at common hour because people have jobs and practices to go to,” Hopkins said.
Other universities fulfilled their missed days differently. St. Joseph’s College eliminated finals week to have more classes and Stony Brook University professors were just told to consolidate the course material and added no make-up days. 
“We can’t speak to how other colleges are choosing to fulfill their contact hour obligations. Additionally, not all Long Island colleges were closed for the same lengthy period that LIU Post was due to the consecutive storms,” said Carson.

LIU Post’s Association for Campus Programming (ACP) had students hyped and anxious for Saturday’s homecoming with a week full of exciting events. Homecoming is a week dedicated to welcoming back alumni and also a time for current students to have fun, socialize, and partake in school pride. The week is very important to Post students for many reasons, and this year’s homecoming proved to be a success.
Jeremiah Aviles, sophomore Childhood Education major, said, “Homecoming is the core of LIU Post because it’s the anticipation of a crazy weekend.”
Main Events
Some of the main events were the pep rally, the homecoming carnival, the homecoming party, and the biggest event of the week was the homecoming football game.
The pep rally was held in the Pratt Center on Friday, Oct. 18. It was an enjoyable time for students to demonstrate Post pride and kick off the weekend. The pep rally consisted of performances by the Post dance team, cheerleaders, residence halls, and DJ S. Whit. The rally was also used to introduce LIU’s soccer, volleyball, swim, and football teams.
There was free food and Post giveaways for all guests. The Pratt was packed and the atmosphere was electric.
Alfred Cabera, sophomore Business Management major, believes that homecoming is the most popular school event throughout the year. “It’s the biggest social event of the year. Everyone participates in homecoming, even people from other schools,” said Cabera. “It’s a chance to meet your peers in a different environment.”
The Homecoming Carnival was a magnificent experience for students, families, and guests. The carnival was held in the Pratt and at Hickox Field at noon on Saturday and continued until 4 p.m.
Admission for the carnival was $15 and included a ticket to the football game and a barbeque lunch. There were rides, games, and club tables with promotions and activities.
Student Thoughts
Jesus Cardenas, senior Business and Film major, has always been excited and anxious for homecoming. “Homecoming has always been a time to take a step back from work and have fun with new and old friends,” he said.
“I’m excited about this year because Post is in a remodeling stage and we can make this the biggest homecoming and start new traditions with a new name,” he added.
The Homecoming Party is an annual celebration held on Saturday night for all LIU Post students and their guests to enjoy. The party has usually been held in the basement of Winnick, but this year it was moved to the Pratt Recreation Center to allow room for a greater audience.
Admission to the party was $5 for students and $10 for guests. Student Life, ACP, and a combination of student clubs and organizations hosted the party. The festivities were well attended and the venue was decorated with LIU Post colors and flashing lights.
Teresa Lisbet Ndong, sophomore International Business major, believes that this year’s homecoming was better than last year’s. “There were more fun activities this year, people seem friendlier, and everyone was having a great time together.”
Football Victory
The most important event of all is the homecoming football game. It’s the most anticipated event of the week, and the most popular. The LIU Post football team the Pioneers brought their “A-game” with them as they shutout Pace University in a 58-0 victory.
“I knew we were going to win, we were focused and ready to demolish Pace,” said Matthew Ferere, a sophomore defensive back for the Pioneers.
Homecoming 2013 was a great weekend for Post students to relax, have fun, and take a break from schoolwork just for a little bit. Most students enjoyed themselves and the Pioneer’s victory helped boost everybody’s energy.

Throughout his monthlong show on the streets of New York, the famous graffiti artist known as Banksy has turned the city into a giant game of treasure hunt this October.
Unveiling a new art piece on a daily basis, Banksy communicates with the public through social media and his website, banksyny. com. Posting only a picture of his recent work, and the located area, he leaves it up to New Yorkers to find the exact location—and they do.
People are getting swept up in the hype that is Banksy, and rush to see his art work before it is defaced. The mysterious artist, who remains unidentified to public, calls his monthly exhibit “Better Out Than In,” meaning that art is better on the streets where it is free rather than in a museum.
Banksy challenged authorites with his first piece. On October 1, he painted a kid standing on another kid’s back, reaching for a spray can inside a sign reading: “Graffiti is illegal.”
LIU Post students are captivated by Banksy and his mischievous work. Broadcasting students Rob Hairston and Karoline Onsrud defines graffiti as a visual way of seeing people’s thoughts, thus being art and a way of expression. “Graffiti is more accepted these days,” said Onsrud. “It started as vandalism, but it has developed into an impressive art form which is much more accepted these days. Banksy sends political messages that concerns all of us look at how his work makes all these people flock together!” she added. The British street artist has gone from being a cultural icon in the graffiti community to the name on everyone’s lips.
He wins his audience over with political and social messages, as well as creativity. There is often a double meaning behind his work. However, regardless of Banksy’s increasing popularity, graffiti is still looked at as an illegal action. Or is it?
Banky’s work has forced a new debate about the definition of graffiti. What started out in the ‘70s, with young people tagging their names on buildings and such, has evolved into a form competition with each artist “out-doing” each other.
Banksy has become a living example of how graffiti has expanded its limits. CBS New York reports that his drawings are being protected by plexiglass, and in some cases even by security guards.
The whole meaning behind graffiti has transformed from something that used to be an illegal action into becoming a legal way to make big money.
While certain building owners jump with joy when finding Banksy’s valuable paintings on their property, the NYPD and Mayor Bloomberg are less than enthralled by the brazen acts of the artist, according to CNN. “Graffiti ruins people’s property and is a sign of decay and loss of control,” Bloomberg said.
Despite Banksy leaving his marks all over the city, the NYPD is having a hard time finding him. The search after the elusive artist is still ongoing by law enforcement.
Although not legalized by law, there’s no doubt that Banksy’s work has opened people’s eyes to see graffiti as something more than just vandalism.

LIU Post’s new boutique, located in the old gaming lounge in Hillwood, attracted faculty, staff, and students to its grand opening, Nov. 12.

The anticipation was high as guests waited for the special ribbon cutting, which symbolized the official debut of Post’s first student-run store. Contrary to what might be expected at a grand opening, no food or refreshments were served. However, that didn’t stop the boutique from filling quickly with intrigued students, faculty and professional photographers.
“This boutique is a great way for students to gain hands on experience, and to become entrepreneurs,” said Christina Principato, a senior Accounting major, who works at the boutique.
Nicole Balnis, a sophomore Social Work major, was excited when it came to revisiting the boutique in the near future. “I think it’s pretty nice, and I like that it has nice clothes, that I can definitely see people wearing,” Balnis expressed.
Tamir Dayya, manager and representative, spoke out about the interest, the boutique’s aim, and its progress from the earlier stages. “We had the boutique up and running, from the ground up in two weeks. Everyone from the facilities, to President Cline helped us out. It was true, genuine, teamwork,” said Dayya.
“The whole point is to get the students to run it, so they can learn about executive choices, and envelop themselves in management that can be fun, but also hard work,” Dayya said when asked about the boutique’s purpose on campus. “Thus far, we’ve gotten nothing but positive feedback, and we are very proud of the work we’ve done up to this point,” he added.
“I think it’s a good idea but I don’t know how many students it’s really going to bring in as customers,” said Stephanie Morales, a sophomore Art Therapy major. Morales had a notion that the boutique would definitely draw in various eyes from every direction, but she was unsure if the interest would stay alive.
“Everyone that I’ve spoken to about it, hasn’t shown any real excitement, or interest about it,” she added.

A Mexican Christmas celebration called Los Posadas was celebrated on campus, on Wednesday, Dec. 5. In Spanish, Las Posadas means “the inns” or ”the lodgings” and represents the Biblical journey of Mary and Joseph as they searched for a shelter in Bethlehem before the birth of Jesus.

“This is the Catholic event on Christmas season,” said Father Ted Brown, the chaplain at LIU Post’s Interfaith Center. “From nine days before to the Christmas Eve, Latin American Catholics do this custom every night,” he stated.
Traditionally in Mexico, people gather in a neighborhood home to have a party each night from Dec. 16 to 24. Children get dressed as shepherds, angels, Mary, and Joseph. An angel leads the guests carrying candles to the house—in this case, a dorm. They sing a carol to ask for shelter, and then the host sings a reply regarding their request. After that, guests are welcome to have a party. They end the party with a pinata shaped like the Christmas star. The last day of Las Posadas is on Dec. 24, which is followed by midnight mass, the celebration of Jesus Christ.
People who took part in the custom gathered in the campus chapel, and then the journey began. Students played pilgrims who traveled from house to house searching until they reached a designated home where Las Posadas would be celebrated. First, they made rounds to each dorm, carrying candles with them. When a group of around 15 students reached each dorm, they sang a carol such as “Joy to the World.” After going around the dorms, they went to the Interfaith Center, which is regarded as the shelter, and decorated the chapel.
“I came to join this because it sounded fun,” said Aimee Biernacki, sophomore Healthcare Administration major. “It is a good way to come together with other students, so I want to come back again next year,” she added.
This was the fourth celebration for Matt Mason, senior Criminal Justice major. “As it gives me [a sense of] community, I came to this since I entered LIU Post,” he stated. Mason added that he would have wanted join this seasonal custom even if he weren’t a Catholic.
“Originally, Las Posadas is a Catholic custom, but it is not only for the Catholic on campus” said David Armas, junior Sociology major, who is the vice president of the Newman Club Catholic Community, LIU Post’s Catholic student organization. He continued, “Las Posadas this year was really successful. Many people stayed [until] around 11 p.m. to decorate the chapel.”
The Interfaith Center is currently decorated with a Christmas tree, along with green and red lights. The decoration was done by those who took part in Las Posadas.

This fall, there have been incessant complaints from students about the shortage of food at Winnick Dining Hall, as well as the low number of staff members working at Winnick, which, according to diners, is causing delays and difficulties when it comes to servicing students during meal times.
Students have reported that they have to wait in long lines with bad service, and that they aren’t provided healthy options, or even fresh food. “The only options there are [at Winnick] are hamburgers and pizza and the salad bar is usually stocked with lettuce that has been left out and is brown,” said Melissa Nosel, a junior English Library Science major.
Winnick’s hours have also caused some grumbling among students. Nosel says that Winnick doesn’t open until 7.30 a.m. However, like many students, Nosel has an 8 a.m. class. As a result, she is unable to get breakfast before her classes begin for the day.
“The one station that I love is the pasta station and it is closed half the time to keep open the pizza station because they don’t have enough staff to run all of the stations,” Nosel said. “There are six or seven stations, and most of the stations are closed because there is not enough staff to run them. The lines are out the door because they have one worker at each station trying to feed thousand[s of] students at [a] time, especially during common hour. I can’t count the amount of times that there were no utensils, no cereal, and the vending machines were broken.”
The lack of healthy options poses a problem for some students, especially those with medical conditions that make them unable to eat certain foods. Stacie Palacino, a senior Child Education major who underwent surgery to remove her gallbladder, has been forced to eliminate fats and gluten from her diet. Palacino claims that Winnick told her that they would accommodate her dietary needs, but there are still not a lot of healthy options and the salad bar is never stocked.
Ultimately, Palacino made the decision in Fall 2012 to become a commuter because of the lack of dietary options provided for her in the dining hall. “[Living on campus] just wasn’t working,” said Palacino. “I’m much happier now. I can make my food from home and I know that I’m eating healthy foods that I can eat, and not the greasy foods [that were provided for me at Winnick].”
Paul Carroll, Director of Operations of Aramark, the food service provider at LIU Post, states that there are no staff shortages at Winnick, and certainly no food shortages: “We currently have no [worker] shortages at Winnick Hall with the exception of some weekend coverage that is generally covered with student workers,” said Carroll. “We have 55 union members at Winnick Hall, and [many of them] are long-term union members who have served us well. We have no future plans of any change.”
Carroll also stated that the complaints of food shortages are unfounded. “We currently have the same amount of stations open as last semester,” Carroll said. “This includes pizza, pasta, street food, grill, home zone, dessert, salad bar, vegetarian-yogurt bar, deli, continental breakfast and cold food setup. There are no plans currently to change any food options, however we did introduce two new meal plans for commuter students.”
Resident students are used to using the magnetic stripe on the back of their student ID card in place of using cash to pay for food. LIU has instituted a brand new meal plan for commuter students that provide them the same food services as resident students. When a full-time commuter student uses their student ID card, they will automatically receive $50 to get them started. Commuter students will be able to choose from a 25 Block Plan, which provides 25 meals per semester and 50 dining dollars; a 50 Block Plan, which provides 50 meals per semester and 50 dining dollars; and the Commuter Dining Dollar Plan, which allows students to add more dollars to their plans at any time.
Despite this change, resident students believe that commuter students will only face the same problems that they do when it comes to the food selection and services.
“I’m cutting down my meal plan next semester,” said Nosel. “I have a meal plan for three meals a day, and yet I don’t use it most of the time because there is no food there a lot of the time and bad service.”
There are students who feel as though most of their dietary needs are being met with only little complaint or concern. “Overall, it could be worse,” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. “If I avoid the chicken then I’m usually very happy.”
The Pioneer was unable to receive a comment from Administration; Abagail Van Vlerah, the Dean of Students, referred Jackie Nealon, the Chief of Staff and Vice President of Enrollment, Campus Life, and Communications. Nealon chose not to comment on the matter, but referred to Aramark.

Over the past couple of semesters, more and more students have been attracted to Hicksville for off-campus housing, causing an everyday struggle for students to board the free shuttle, which has a 25 person occupancy limit, to school in the mornings. As a result, the Office of Campus Life and the Student Government Association have worked together to improve transportation—and more options are underway.
Students, faculty, and staff are taking advantage of the shuttle services, and the same hours seem to appeal to them all. “9.00 a.m. is by far the busiest time,” said Ian Jonson, a freshman undeclared major who lives in the Hicksville area. “I’ve been at the bus stop 20 minutes before the shuttle is supposed to leave, and you could tell straight away it wasn’t enough.”
The excessive demand for the crowded morning shuttle buses leaves students with two options: to go hard or to go home. “Lines have been non-exist[ent], and those getting a spot on the bus have usually been those with the sharpest elbows,” Jonson said. Instead of taking the risk, Jonson and his housemates have given up the extra hour of sleep, and are taking the 8 a.m. shuttle instead to make sure they don’t miss class.
Recently, the Office of Campus Life and SGA have studied the issue, and together worked on changes to the shuttles. “Along with the SGA, we constantly monitor the transportation needs of our students and make changes accordingly,” said Abagail Van Vlerah, Dean of Students.
“Van Vlerah and I actually rode [the shuttle] last week sometime in the afternoon, to get feedback from students,” Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, added.
The changes already in place have not increased the amount of rides to and from Hicksville; the latest round that used to leave campus at 9 p.m. has been taken away, and the shuttle is now going at 1 p.m. instead, breaking the previous almost six-hour break the shuttle used to have between 10:20 a.m. and 4 p.m.
“It is an expensive and year-round service, so we have tried to play around with the schedule before increasing any costs,” Berthel said. “SGA has allocated over $100,000 for the student shuttle service during the 2014-2015 academic year,” he added.
For those who dorm and don’t own a car, the off-campus shuttles to Hicksville and Pathmark in Greenvale have been the only free alternatives to leave the campus. “During weekdays, I try not to take the shuttle after its break in the afternoon because I know it will be completely full of commuters,” said Tine Markar Lolland, a junior Public Relations major. Lolland explained that the weekends are the only times she does not have any problems.
To facilitate leaving campus for on- campus students, the university will launch a new Zipcar program on Wednesday, Oct. 22, which will allow students to use an on-campus rental car all hours.
The Zipcar project is a global car- sharing network with operations at other college campuses throughout the U.S. Any student over 18, faculty over 21, or community member who has been a licensed driver for a minimum of one year (international licenses accepted) can apply. After registering online, and paying the annual membership fee ($25 for first year), students can reserve a car at any time of the day. Over the first month, students will be discounted for their first $35 driving dollars, according to William Achnitz, Campus Life Coordinator and Sustainability Coordinator. The rental will take place outside of Post Hall.
Jonson believes it is only fair to give the residents another option to leave campus; however, he wants to see some action taken on the free Hicksville shuttle, as well. “The shuttle is a service offered by the school, and you can’t offer services unless you can guarantee all those wishing to utilize it will be able to.”
Berthel stated that he understands where the frustration with the shuttle service comes from. “Students definitely have reasons to complain,” he said.
“The services are paid for by university and student funds, ultimately coming from student activity fees.”
SGA and Campus Life are considering further changes to the shuttle service that may affect the university wallet moving forward. “We are looking into a bigger bus,” Berthel said. “We are also thinking about moving the bus stop from the Chapel to the Humanities area where most departments are located; this way, students will get dropped off closer to the classrooms.”
However, Berthel warned students not to expect major changes any time soon. “Be patient. It is not going to happen overnight.”

As The Pioneer reported on Sept. 30, the LIU Post equestrian team set out to complete a daunting mission—raise enough money to rescue a slaughter- bound miniature horse, and make him the team mascot. The team held a bake sale during common hour in Hillwood Commons, posted flyers throughout campus seeking donations, and even created a web page on gofundme.com so that others could donate money to pay for the purchase and future expenses of the miniature horse.
After a lot of hard work and dedication, the girls were finally financially able to travel to the horse auction located in New Holland, Pennsylvania and choose which lucky horse would be coming home with them for another chance at life as their team mascot.
The mission took place on Oct. 13. Hope, a sweet palomino mare, caught the riders’ attention right away. Two of the three team captains, Cristina Bakos, a senior Speech Pathology/Pre-Med major, and Alex Diez, a junior Biology major, as well as one of the fundraisers, Christina Cepeda, a junior Psychology major, brought the mini horse to her new home in Bakos’ backyard barn in Nesconset, where she will have a much more exciting life with the other mini horses—and a donkey—already living there.
All of the money raised by the team will be put towards the many expenses needed to properly care for any horse, including veterinary and farrier appointments (hoof trimming), board, feed, wormer, shavings, and clothing. Hope had a warm welcome to the LIU Post equestrian team when she made her mascot debut at the annual Homecoming Football Game on Saturday, Oct. 18. For such a tiny equine, Hope handled the loud, crazy football game quite well. She tried her best to not get too overwhelmed.
“She was calm at homecoming, but would sometimes get startled with sudden, loud noises like popping balloons or the loud music, but eventually she got accustomed to the all the noise,” said team member Colleen Dreyer, a senior Public Relations major and the team’s Treasurer.
The day at homecoming was a success, which even included raising more money to care for Hope in the future. The equestrian team raised $1,110 through their “Go Fund Me” account, which is linked on the team’s Facebook page. To donate money to help Hope, you can go to www.gofundme.com/save- a-pony, or email christina.kotarski@my.liu.edu or christina.cepeda@my.liu.edu.
The next on-campus horse show at the North Shore Equestrian Center will be on Nov. 9, at 8 a.m. Hope, the mini mascot, will be there to show support. The event is open to the public.

LIU Post has announced that it will introduce two new schools to campus for the 2015- 2016 academic year: The School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering, and the Honors College. Jeffrey Kane, Vice President of Academic Affairs, believes this reorganization will increase enrollment, and be beneficial to the overall academic environment on campus.
The School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering will be an independent academic unit that will join the School of Business and the School of Professional Accountancy within the College of Management. Prior to the reorganization, the College of Management consisted of the following departments and schools: the School of Professional Accountancy; the Department of Social Work; the Department of Public Administration; the Department of Criminal Justice; the Department of Management; the Department of Finance; and the Department of Marketing.
However, the administration began to notice that certain academic units, such as the Department of Social Work, the Department of Criminal Justice and the Department of Administration, didn’t seem to fit within the College of Management, according to Kane. “These very disparate group of units couldn’t be called the School of Business because you can’t include Social Work as a part of the School of Business. You can’t call Criminal Justice a part of the School of Business. As a result, they created an umbrella term called the College of Management. However, the problem with that is that it created a lot of confusion on the outside,” Kane said. One of the reasons for the creation of the School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management was to expand on areas of growth and development such as computer science, according to Kane. “One of the main objectives [of the reorganization] is for students to realize that we do have Computer Science at this university. If you look at the Department of Labor statistics and look at the area of growth in the job market where our students can get really good and professional careers started and developed, there’s a heavy emphasis on computers. There is a tremendous growth area in the job market for this new school will initially be small, but he stated that his goal for the school is for it to grow, and ensure that students have careers ahead of them that “will serve them well and make them happy and productive people.”
“I’m fine with the idea as long as it doesn’t interfere with my graduation date,” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. However, according to Kane, the new school will have no impact on individual students because it will not change the already pre-existing courses or the majors offered on campus. “If you’re in accountancy, then you’re still in accountancy. If you’re in business, then you’re still in business. If you’re in social work then you’re still in social work. None of this has an effect on the program that you are enrolled in,” Kane added.
Project Management, a new program that will be offered in the fall in the new school, is a graduate level program now at the approval stage. A degree in Project Management will give students the skills to oversee all aspects of a project, including planning, budget, project control, strategic issues, value management, human resource issues, and legal issues.
The establishment of the Honors College will give LIU more prominence, attract more students, and promote the academic environment on campus that is devoted to students and their academic needs. “I believe that we have one of the finest honors programs in the country,” Kane explained. “When it’s called a program, it seems to have a lesser status than, let’s say, the honors colleges at other universities. It gives the appearance, although a misguided appearance, that the program here is of lesser significance. We want to promote that program and raise recognition of the role that it plays at the university.”
“I feel very positive about this because [it] is a direction that many universities across the country are taking,” said Joan Digby, a Professor of English and the Director of the Honors Department. “It makes us more competitive to be a college rather than a program. I think that it will even encourage students that are already going to Post to apply to be in the honors program, knowing that their diploma will read that they graduated from an Honors College.” Digby continued, “My primary goal is to expand the number of students in the Honors College because that will permit us to offer more courses and advanced electives every single semester. I’d like to try to get an additional 100 or 150 people by next fall so that there [can be] more course offerings.”
Starting in the fall, when Honor students graduate from Post, their diploma will state that they graduated from an Honors College, according to Digby. Honors program students will automatically be moved into the Honors College next fall. The Honors College will keep the same reporting schedule, and will not be structurally different; however, students will have more opportunities being a part of an Honors College rather than an honors program. Digby predicts that as the Honors College at Post develops in connection with LIU Brooklyn’s new Honors College that Post and Brooklyn will have more programming together.
“It might mean that our Pre-Pharmacy students might want to take some courses at the Honors [College] at the Brooklyn campus, or other students from Brooklyn might want to come do a semester to concentrate on Theatre or Music at Post, where we are very strong,” Digby said. “The benefit of all of this, that as a director of a college, I’ll be able to work more directly with the deans of the other colleges so that I will have more input in terms of getting faculty to teach an honors course, and getting faculty to advise research for honors students.”
“If we can be more successful in letting people know what we have, then hopefully we can attract students from different regions, [and] not just the local area,” Kane said. “A dream of ours at the moment would be to open up an honors dorm.”
This fall, the Honors office was moved from Humanities building to room 202 in the Winnick Mansion. Kane believes the change of location of Honors from Humanities to the Winnick Mansion displays great symbolism for what it represents to the university. “Just look at the new location. It’s on the top of the hill in [the] beautiful Winnick Mansion. It promotes the message of, ‘Hey we’re proud of this thing.’ It’s not one program among many. It’s the gleaming top.”
As of now, a dean has yet to be appointed for the School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering, and there is currently no deanship for the Honors College. Dr. Digby will remain the director.
“You can think of these changes as a statement of our aspirations. The real impact is telling people what we aspire towards and what we aim to do in order to move the campus forward. It’s more a picture of where we want the campus to be rather than an administrative shuffling like it might appear to be,” Kane said.

Now that summer is over and it is officially fall, it is time to put the shorts and flip-flops away. The change in weather means there is a change in the clothes we wear, the trends we see, and the drinks we find to be popular at Starbucks.
For those who try to stay fashion forward, it’s important to know what’s trendy this season. “Fall is the best time for fashion,” said Monica Peralta, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “It is just starting to cool down; you can layer, layer, and layer, without looking weather confused.”
“There are a lot of fun new trends this fall. Shift dresses, sock boots, pajama dressing, patchwork, and new Victorian pussy bows are the hottest trends right now,” said Stephanie Adelson Bray, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “This season we are seeing a lot of fringe, a lot of burgundy, and a lot of suede,” Peralta added.
“The color I’ve seen everywhere and a color that I really like is olive green,” said Jawaan Smith, a senior Arts Management major. “From pants to jackets, it’s a great color.” While there are new trends every season, some trends are timeless. Fringe, military style, layering, neutrals, velvet, and bohemian are just a few of the trends that will be carried over from years before, this fall, according to Bray.
Fashion for men tends to be overlooked, however, both Bray and Peralta made sure to include trends that men can totally rock this fall. “They should focus on layering,” Bray said. “3⁄4 zip sweaters, a button down under with a skinny scarf and a vest.”
“We are also seeing a lot of Monochrome happening,” Peralta added. “Which is super easy to pull off.”
Fall, to some, is also known as the season of pumpkin spice everything. Starbucks officially has their famous pumpkin spice latte back for the season. “I have yet to fall under the magical spell this pumpkin spice has put every girl in the world under,” Peralta said.
“Pumpkin spice kind of unofficially announces the beginning of the fall season,” Smith said. Bray agreed, but added, “Pumpkin spice isn’t bad, but I think there’s too much hype. A classic chai latte and caramel macchiato will do the job just fine,” she said.
To help those who don’t understand fashion trends, Bray and Peralta both gave some of their “must haves” for the season. The boyfriend jean, over the knee boots, plaid scarves, black booties, turtle neck sweaters, and duster coats are some of Peralta’s recommendations for women this season. Bucket bags, velvet booties, and fringe skirts are a few of Bray’s must haves this season.
For men, Peralta suggests: joggers, khaki denim, light denim, wool topcoats, chukka boots, bomber jackets, and brown leather sneakers. “Everyone must get their hands on a pair of beige Nike Air Max Thea Leather Sneakers and Adidas classic superstar sneakers,” said Bray. Smith suggests that everyone should own a pair of black jeans, colored pants (burgundy, navy, olive), and brown boots.
“Every season is a great season for fashion. You make it the way you want it to be,” Bray said. “There are limitless amount of options to wear in the fall. Personally, it’s my favorite time of the year to dress up.”

People might think that Greek life is all about the parties, cliques, and frat houses, because movies portray them that way. However, this isn’t the movies, this is LIU Post. At this university, there are no fraternity houses or cliques, but Greek life is a “community of students who are initiated into one of our recognized fraternities or sororities,” said Katherine Wieme, Director of Greek Life & Student Involvement, a position in Campus Life.
Wieme explained that it offers students opportunities to bond, strengthen leadership qualities, and network with alumni. There are 11 fraternities and sororities on campus: Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Delta Zeta, Phi Sigma Kappa, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and Chi Nu Alpha.
“We currently have over 250 students in fraternities and sororities,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life. “We are proud to now be home to some of the largest national organizations in the world and are excited to add Sigma Delta Tau to our community in the spring
[2016].”These organizations are not all the same; they have different recruitment processes, structures, and types of councils. The three types of councils are the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Association, or the Multicultural Council. Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Phi Epsilon, and Delta Zeta are Panhellenic sororities. Tau Kappa Epsilon, Phi Sigma Kappa, Theta Chi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon are fraternities a part of the Interfraternity Council. Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Tau, and Chi Nu Alpha, are the fraternities and sororities that belong to the Multicultural Council.
“Being in a cultural organization differs from other organizations because we’re very passionate about our organization’s history and the meaning behind the letters; we take pride in the roots of where we come from,” said Richard Batista, President of Phi Iota Alpha, and a senior adolescence education major in mathematics. Batista also explains that one thing you learn is that you should “never forget who you are and where you come from.”
Each fraternity and sorority has a philanthropy that they partner with. “In DZ [Delta Zeta], we raise money and awareness for our philanthropy Speech and Hearing, to try to make a difference in other people’s lives,” said Nicole Cunningham, President of DZ and graduate literacy education major. Their philanthropy focuses on those that are affected by speech and hearing challenges.
“Engaging in community service projects and raising funds and awareness for various philanthropic organizations are fundamental components of being an active member of a Greek organization,” said Alexa Regina, President of Alpha Phi Epsilon, and a senior social work major. She mentions that AEPHI “values service, which has allowed me to give back to the community with the help of my
sisters.”It can be hard to find your place in college. Now that doesn’t mean your clique or “it” group, but a group of people that help you find yourself and enjoy your college and life experience. Greek life can help “students to find their home in a fraternity or sorority,” Wieme said.
“Joining Greek life is so important because when you join your org, you are also joining a community,” said Giovanna Domingo, Financial VP of Alpha Xi Delta, and sophomore accounting major. “Over the last year I have seen such a positive change in Greek life. Even if you don’t know a person and you’re wearing letters, you always have something to talk about because there is that common thread.” She explained that more people have joined, which has shown such a positive growth.
These organizations have made an impact on many students and the campus itself. “Joining Greek life has without a doubt been one of the best decisions I’ve made in college. It’s gotten me way more involved than I ever was before on campus and it’s equipped me with invaluable leadership opportunities,” said Jawaan Smith, VP of Phi Sigma Kappa, a senior arts management major. “Also, knowing you have 20 plus guys who always have your back and are there for you through your highs and lows is a great feeling. It’s definitely a rewarding experience.”
“We are proud that our Greek Life students are also active in student organizations, residence halls, athletic teams, and student run businesses,” Wieme said.
“Being in Greek life means being involved, but still the most important job is for you to be a student. The hardest part about Greek Life is time management,” according to Michael Aquilano, Programing Director of Phi Sigma Kappa and sophomore psychology major.
“When you join Greek Life, you become a part of something that is very active and you need to learn or already have time management skills. Especially if you want to hold and E-board or chair position,” he said.
Wieme explained that the Office of Campus Life serves as the primary advisor to Greek life, including all the governing councils, organizations, and individual members and that they support the growth of these organizations. Campus Life “maintains a Greek life expansion policy for any organization who is interested in becoming recognized on campus,” she said.
“All of our organizations are national with chapters across the country,” Wieme said. “Post students who join a fraternity or sorority will have the opportunity to attend conventions, network with alumni, and meet fellow members from other institutions.”
Berthel added that Campus Life, and the university fully support the fraternities and sororities. “Providing opportunities for students to take part in Greek life is very important to us and we will continue to look
for ways to grow and strengthen our current organizations and add new organizations,” he said. If you think Greek life is for you: go out and meet the different organizations during Greek week or Greek events, which are held every semester and maybe you’ll find your new home.

How many “selfies” does it take to settle on the “perfect” picture? How many times have you posted a “fire” picture onto social media, but your peers didn’t reciprocate (like the photo), so you deleted it? Although the players remain the same, the games and the rules of which the players play by, have changed ten-fold.
Once upon a time, well, really before all of these social media sites, we would look at each other on the Starbucks line, and make our judgments from there. However, “We now look at the person’s Instagram first, make our first judgment, and then we take it from there,” said senior history major, Kathy Rice. “I can name 1,000 times where some guy would like [my posts] on Instagram, I guess showing interest in
me, but then in person, no social contact, none whatsoever,” she added.
When Rice told me this story, I literally, “loled,” but this really is no laughing matter.
Let’s me ask you again, why does it take 200 pictures to get that one perfect selfie?! To be honest, folks, I think I have that answer. The mini photo shoot we partake in when we want to post a picture on social media is caused by something I would like to call, “Social Perfection,” a.k.a delusion.
I believe that social media is driving our youth to the brink of insanity as it causes them to feel the need to to “qualify” within their respective social groups. For example, Marcella Anteri, a Suffolk County High School physics teacher, recalled a story about one of her students and social media.
“One of my juniors, who will remain nameless, came to me at the end of class,” said Anteri. “That class, she did none of her physics homework, and totally bombed my quiz. She came to me, and before she could say anything, tears began pouring from her face.”
Anteri later revealed that her student’s disarray stemmed from her fear that she was being judged off of her social media posts. According to Anteri, her student told her, “I accidentally liked my friend’s ex-boyfriend’s picture, and they’ve been ignoring me all week.”
We all know being in high school can come with its times of social hardship to say the least, but if you think about it, social media just adds to that fire we deal with in our adolescent years. In the age of social media and texting, misinterpretation and cyberbullying have run rampant. It has led Mike Kurtz, a junior education major, across the street at NYIT to stop texting all together.
“You really wouldn’t believe how many fights [with friends] I’ve gotten into because I didn’t answer a text within three minutes, or reply ‘lol’ instead of replying ‘lmfao,’” Kurtz said. “I remember one time where a girl I was dating told me a joke, at which I replied [over text], ‘lol.’ She later texted saying, ‘I haven’t liked your attitude all day and that last text proves you’re giving me one right now.’”
“I never texted her back after that, because I knew where it was going to go,” said Kurtz. “If I have something to say, or want to talk to you then I’m just going to call you. I’m bringing back the phone call!”
Social media to me is a synthetic form of human interaction; a form of interaction, which in most cases that does us more harm than good. Yes, social media links us beyond the classroom and to each corner of the Earth; however, Instagram, Twitter, even Facebook, and Snapchat, have become portfolios, or as I’d like to call them, “baseball cards” to track our latest social undertakings, misleadingly presenting them to our peers.
Posting a picture of your lavish vacations, the new car, your selfie, taken from an angle that probably led you to sprain your wrist and shoulder, and not to mention your “following to followers ratio.” Social Media allows us to portray ourselves in our “best” light, and that’s great! What if social media just further enhances the saying “perception is reality,” in a world where everyone’s perception of each other is derived of social media. It makes me wonder if we are losing our authenticity, and that’s kind of scary. Well, too scary to me at least.

To the Editors of the Pioneer:
On Wednesday, I posted a response to the excellent letter Editor Caroline Ryan published in the Pioneer. In my post, I expressed admiration for the clarity of her argument, and sadness that a student newspaper faces such deplorable conditions in trying to report campus news. This stance of complete message control on the part of the administration is antithetical to the concept of academic freedom and freedom of the press. It is demoralizing to the student journalists and heartbreaking for faculty members who work with them. It also makes our journalism program a hard sell to potential students who want the experience of working on a vital and relevant paper, not a University Public Relations mouthpiece, and discover that cannot happen here.
I am writing this letter as an addendum to my brief Facebook post (which seems to have disappeared) after learning that copies of this week’s Pioneer seem to have been removed from the campus before visitors to Homecoming and the Admissions Open House could grab them. This has happened before. It also happens at the Brooklyn Campus. It is shocking to see this go on in a campus community. I am appalled that our administration thinks this approach is somehow beneficial to our university, when in fact it does damage to all of us.

Two of the five deans of the schools and colleges on campus are interim, acting deans. One was appointed earlier this year and the other was appointed last week. Only one of the five deans has been in place for more than a year.
On Oct. 6, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane, sent a campus-wide email stating Dr. Albert Inserra, the former president of Dowling College, has been appointed dean of the college of education, information and technology. Inserra replaces Louisa Kramer-Vida, who was the acting dean of the college of education, information and technology.
Vida-Kramer is the chairperson of the department of special education as well as an assistant professor in the department. She was approached to take the position of acting dean in mid-June 2016, and began the position on Jul. 1. Kramer replaced Dr. Barbara Garii, the former dean of the college of education, information and technology, who became the vice president for academic affairs of St. Joseph’s College on Jul. 18.
As the Pioneer reported in its Oct. 5 issue, Jeffrey Belnap, the dean of LIU Global, has been appointed the acting dean of the college of liberal arts, succeeding chemistry Professor Nicholas Ramer, who was the acting dean of the college from June 2015 to August 2016. Ramer replaced former Dean Katherine Hill-Miller, who stepped down from the position in 2015 and returned to her position as a professor in the English department.
Art therapy professor, Christine Kerr, became the acting dean of the college of art, communications and design on Sept. 1, succeeding Noel Zahler, who left the University in August.
Stacey Gopack, who was the acting dean of the School of Health Professions last year, is the newly appointed permanent dean of that school.
Only Robert Valli, the dean of the College of Management, has been in his position since 2015.
Some students have expressed confusion and frustration about the coming and going of the deans. Senior economics major Marvin Johnson has had positive experiences with going to deans for help throughout his academic career. Johnson feels that with many of the deans stepping down and the administration constantly needing to find new replacements, many students may begin to feel lost. “Some students have a unique bond with certain deans and by them switching up and resigning, it just makes the students feel not wanted,” Johnson said. “It’s like a puppy with a new owner.”

What does it mean to be a woman? Where and when did the concept of womanhood come to life? The answers to these questions can be found on the stage in PTC’s production, “Age of Elizabeth.”
Follow modern Elizabeth and her mother’s story of betrayal and her journey through a timeline of mother-daughter relationships in past generations of her family, and the lessons that were passed down by each; discover how the trials women had faced in the past impact the future and define womanhood.
Written and directed by Logan DeWitt, the idea for “Age of Elizabeth” arose from a topic of discussion on nature vs. nurture within DeWitt’s household, where she is the only biological child of seven. DeWitt started to question learned behavior to search for the reasoning behind womanhood.
“I started writing it about a year ago,” DeWitt said. The script is still changing and transforming as the actors go through the workshop and rehearsal process.
The cast consists primarily of women: five Elizabeths, following the usually male tradition of passing down a name, and one man who plays every male character within the show.
DeWitt wanted to center the focus on the women of the play, as opposed to the men, an attempt to pass the Bechdel test. The test identifies the roles of female characters within a play or film based on three questions: whether they are named, interact with other female characters, and talk about anything other than a male character. In the entertainment industry today, many films fail that test. This pushed DeWitt to have a female-driven show.
“It’s really interesting being in this specific show,” said Cayla Michael, sophomore musical theatre major playing as modern Elizabeth. “There are a lot of things that she (Elizabeth) goes through that is personal to me and other people in my life.”
An overbearing and involved mother pressures Elizabeth, an issue that Michael sees reflected in some of her friends. “It gives me a sense of what they must have gone through,” she said.
With all of the focus on content and meaning throughout the play, the set itself is made to be simplistic in a fair contrast. Containing a single chair, three hanging frames to serve as time dividers, and walls on the sides covered in photos, the set establishes a place in time without drawing too much attention from the messages of the story.
What DeWitt wants is for the audience to examine the relationships they have in their own lives and what messages they are sending to one another through their interactions, especially for women. “Are we building one another up,” DeWitt asked, “Or are we subliminally tearing one another down?”
“Age of Elizabeth” will be showing at the Rifle Range Theater on Oct. 28-29 at 8 p.m. and Oct. 30 at 3 p.m.

On Wednesday, Nov. 9 professors and students joined together to express their feelings about the presidential election by holding a sit-in during common hour in Hillwood Commons.
“The idea behind the sit in was to come together and find positivity and togetherness on a day that wasn’t so happy for most of us,” said Alexandra Mitchell, a senior musical theatre major. She didn’t want to call the event an anti-Trump campaign.
“It was a Pro-people sit-in where we wanted the students of Post to know that no matter who you are, what you identify as, and where you come from, you are important and your voice matters here.”
Taylor Bass, another senior musical theatre major, also partook in the sit-in. “It was a tough day. All of my classes were like funerals, both the students and teachers were in tears,” she recollected. “The majority of my peers are having their rights challenged by Trump’s presidency. It put my heart at ease to know that people were thinking the same thing as me and were just as scared as me.” Although the sit-in was peaceful, Public Safety and Dean of students Abagail Van Vlerah stopped by to make sure everything remained calm.
“I think the biggest part of this movement is that we do not emulate the behavior of our president-elect,” Bass explained.
“We will no longer tolerate those using his platform for violence. We will not be silenced by his presidency just because he isn’t fighting for us, we will fight for ourselves and for our rights as human beings in this country.”

Nov. 14 was in many ways a Monday like no other. Still reeling from perhaps one of the most tumultuous, momentous and historic elections in the history of American politics, Post’s theatre majors began their weekly retreat back to the classroom.
However, most, if not all theatre majors attending the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building that day were shocked with inspiration when they saw what was waiting for them on the chalkboard in the west wing of the building.
An anonymous creator left a platform for theatre majors to put their dreams into writing, for all of campus to see. The creator has yet to claim responsibility for the mural.
“It’s a board where everyone can talk freely about anything,” said Sabrina Ali, a freshman theatre major, who also works as a receptionist in the department of theatre, dance & arts management. “It’s completely anonymous, it’s us being ourselves.”
With her hands folded, Ali gazed at the mural and said, “We want to be free, and this wall is our outlet.” According to Ali, the mural only began with the words ‘Before I Die, I want to…” and since then, this outlet has grown every day, consistently, by the hour, with each student and one dream at a time.
While Ali was speaking, three students passed by the mural and one contributed, writing what she wishes to accomplish before her time comes: “Make Mom and Dad Proud.”
The mural of motivation has no names, signatures, or any other form of identification. Regardless of whether it’s an image, quote, or simply just a word, this mural allows members of the student body to peacefully and properly display their thoughts, their emotions, and their perspective.
“We seem to learn a lot more about one another when we reveal ourselves to one another,” said Jacob Lackey, a freshman undeclared major. “I think the mural humanizes us, and in a digital world, we sometimes lose touch of that.”
With no plans to remove it, the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building mural currently remains untouched, located on the old chalkboard in the west wing of the building. Students who wish to view and/or contribute to the mural are welcome to do so as long as reverence is shown for classes that may be in attendance.

Former United States President, Bill Clinton spoke to a sold out audience at the Tilles Center on Thursday, Oct. 5.
The event, hosted by former U.S. Congressman Steve Israel and the LIU Global Institute, featured Clinton speaking for nearly an hour on topics including global issues, his wife’s presidential campaign, and the current White House administration.
The event then switched over to the Q & A session with Israel, focused on a number of important topics making news headlines today, such as gun violence, college debt, North Korea, and immigration.
Throughout the night, Clinton spoke about embracing our differences as Americans and working together. Our goal should be “to build more inclusive prosperity, more inclusive societies…and more inclusive politics,” Clinton said.
“In this age, you can build all the walls you want; we are still interconnected,” Clinton said. He stressed that it’s what brings people together that’s more important than the things that divide us.
Abraham Orenstein, a senior broadcasting major was one of the few LIU Post students who attended the event. He was impressed with the speech, although he described himself as a Sanders supporter. “I thought it was a really strong speech that focused on embracing our differences and coming together,” Orenstein said.
Clinton also spoke about the Electoral College which ultimately put Donald Trump in the presidency, although Hillary Clinton won popular vote. “Since I believe in democracy, I believe the person who gets the most votes should win,” he said.
The audience applauded when Clinton spoke about college affordability. “We should do whatever we can to have the maximum amount of people graduate debt-free,” he said, adding that our goal should be for every student from a non-rich family to get out of college without any debt.
On the topic of North Korea, Clinton said that North Korea’s Dictator, Kim Jong Un, has “done and said enough to be of grave concern.” However, Clinton admitted that he didn’t know much more about the current situation than what we read in the news. Clinton did however, caution our current administration, warning that we should know exactly what we are getting into before taking any action. The Trump administration should work with South Korea, China, Japan and Russia on handling North Korea, Clinton said. Israel asked Clinton what international challenge made him “toss and turn the most” during his presidency. “I was always worried about Osama Bin Laden and al- Qaida because he came from a wealthy family and he lived in a cave, which should tell you something – he believed what he was doing,” Clinton said.
Gun control, in light of the recent massacre in Las Vegas, was also discussed. “You do not need this to defend yourself,” Clinton stated about bump stocks, devices which allow semi-automatic weapons to mimic the ring speed of a fully automatic weapon. Clinton recommended “giving the voters the direct voice on this; they trust themselves more than they trust the politicians,” he said.
Michael Themistocleous, a 2017 Post alumnus who is the Tilles Center’s guest services manager, said that the Tilles Center staff worked with the Nassau County Police Department, the former president’s secret service, and the Old Brookville police to ensure everyone’s safety during the event. “I’m really happy about the Global Institute being a part of LIU. Steve Israel’s knowledge and connections can really enlighten everyone on campus, on both sides of the spectrum,” he said.
The Global Institute is partnering with the Hutton House for a book event on, “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign” by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. The event will be held in Lorber Hall on Oct. 25 at 1 p.m.

On Friday, Oct. 13, the day before Homecoming, students were surprised to find 25 new yellow bicycles spread out across the campus, with multiple bikes chained to bike racks in front of Post Hall, Brookville Hall, the library, and between Nassau and Suffolk Halls.
Students received an email from President Kimberly Cline later that day, explaining that the new bikes had many uses, “whether it is rushing to your next class or squeezing in a quick workout.”
Students were expected to follow an “honor code,” according to the president’s email. Students were given the code “1954,” to unlock bike chains and to use the bikes at their own pleasure on campus, free of charge. Unfortunately, within days of their introduction to the campus, bikes were missing or damaged. Some bikes were hidden around campus, or taken into buildings and rooms to keep other students from being able to ride them. Another instance that occurred included the use of a personal lock to chain the campus bike.
Scott Carlin, the director of Center for Sustainability, is delighted that the administration offered on-campus bicycles to students.
Several years ago, students in the department of Earth and environmental science explored several alternative bicycle options for the campus. “Student research included working with third-party companies that manage and maintain the bicycles, [create] bicycle paths on the campus, and working to make sure that bicycles, pedestrians, and cars can share the campus safely,” Carlin said.
Carlin went on to say that it is not unusual for new bike programs to experience growing pains, and posed the same questions many students are asking. Should students be able to borrow bicycles anonymously or should they need an ID to borrow them? What happens with at tires and other maintenance issues? Who will be responsible?
Campus Life did not comment on the misconduct with bikes on campus. “We are excited to hear the initial feedback about the bike program. Students have been riding bikes around campus and we are happy that the program has been such a success,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said in an email. His email goes on to state, “As with any new program, we are constantly evaluating to determine future improvements and enhancements.
Students who have feedback regarding the program are encouraged to contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299-2800.”

At 6:57 a.m. on a rainy Monday morning, Oct. 30, an announcement was sent via email and text message to students and faculty notifying them that all Monday classes would be cancelled. According to the notice, “due to a power outage, all classes at LIU Post are cancelled for today, Monday, October 30. Faculty and administrative offices are closed. For Tilles Center call 516-299- 3100. Library closed.” Many parts of Long Island had lost power due to the heavy rains and winds throughout the night on Sunday.
The university sent a second email, an hour later, to inform students what services would be open on campus. “Public Safety, Facilities, Dining, and Campus Life staff are fully prepared to service the campus throughout the outage,” the email said. The shuttle bus service to Hicksville was operating on a regular schedule. However, the only available dining option for students was Winnick Student Center, which operated on an extended schedule from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Campus Life staff held activities to keep students occupied during the day, including bingo and Monday night football in the Winnick Student Center Gold Coast room. Members of the campus life staff and resident assistants were available in the residence hall lobbies throughout the day.
Michael Berthel, dean of students, confirmed the buildings affected by the power outage. “On Oct. 30, several buildings on the LIU Post campus were affected by a power outage due to an off-campus issue. As a result of the outage, most academic buildings, the Pratt Recreation Center, Library, and Hillwood Commons were operating on emergency power,” he wrote in an email responding to the Pioneer’s inquiries. “LIU Post Facilities coordinated with PSEG to address the issue and return power to the campus. Without being able to open essential buildings, the decision was made to cancel classes for the day,” he said.
Sam Scarito, a freshman early childhood education major, lives on campus. “The power outage was pretty inconvenient for me. Post Hall was out for the majority of the night, and people were in the hallways doing their homework.
I wasn’t able to set an alarm and I honestly wondered if I’d wakeup for class or not,” she said. Notification of the school closure was sent via text message and email at 6:57 a.m., when many commuter students and professors were already on their way to their 8 a.m. classes. Jamie Leigh, a senior forensic science major, was driving to her 8 a.m. class when she got the notification. “I usually do not check my phone while I am driving but I had my phone propped on my dashboard while using a navigation app. I feel like this happens all the time. The school should know a significant amount of students commute to school and should have taken into consideration how far some students commute. One hour before the first set of classes is not enough time to notify students,” Leigh said. Freshman accounting major Amanda Norton was an hour into her commute to school. “I think they should’ve sent that message earlier. It’s dumb to wait until 7 a.m. when there [are] commuters with early classes who are already on the road. I wasted my time and gas,” she said.
Michael Semler, a junior international business major also leaves early in the morning to get to classes on time but feels that this power outage could have been prevented. “[The university] should make sure that anything at risk, like equipment servers, [are] secured and contingencies should be in place when equipment fails,” he said.
The Pioneer has previously reported on hurricane preparedness. In “Storm Preparedness In the Wake of Hurricane Nate,” By Jada Butler in the Oct. 10 issue, the Pioneer reported that many buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the event of a power outage. “Several buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the case of a power outage, those being Pell, Hoxie, Roth and Kahn Halls, Humanities, the Winnick and McGrath Houses, Hillwood Commons, the Pratt Recreation Center, the Little Theater and Theater & Film building, the Tilles Center, the library, and all in-use residence halls,” according to the Oct. 10 article. “All other buildings, including the Chapel, the music and sculpture buildings, the Fine Arts Center, and Lorber Hall are equipped with backup emergency lighting.”
According to Berthel, the outage was not caused by an on-campus issue. PSEG, the electric provider for Long Island, was responsible for repairing the power lines to restore power to campus. Power was restored at approximately 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 30. Classes resumed on Tuesday, Oct. 31 on a regular Tuesday schedule. Students have not received any notification about whether the Monday classes will be made up.

Despite the chaos in the world and reports of prejudice in the news, many minorities in the United States – blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and others – are excelling academically in college and thriving in life generally. Too often, we forget the contributions they make in our communities, socially and culturally. It is disappointing to see the rage that they experience when still being labeled as the minorities in our multicultural society. Students often feel stigmatized when labels are placed on them, often because of their socio-economic status. Many overcome the labels, however, soar through this issue and lead by example. Blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities in our communities should not feel like outcasts, because all lives matter.
Pablo Correa, the 2016 salutatorian of Hempstead High School, is a sophomore at Dartmouth College. Although he is undecided about his major, he is leaning towards anthropology, with global health and chemistry minors. He is also on the pre-med track. Before entering college, he was actively involved in his high school, serving as Vice President of the Hempstead High School class, Vice President of Club Truth, President and Refounder of Future Doctors of America, and more. Correa, who was born in Colombia, came to the United States when he was four years old. As high school came to an end, he became determined to face the next chapter of his academic career with determination and excellence. Yet, he felt like an outcast during the college application process. “I can’t say for sure that I have experienced racial profiling, but I have felt like an outsider in many different situations, most of them here at Dartmouth or when I was visiting other schools like Princeton or Cornell,” he said.
Correa has encountered moments when he felt uncomfortable sitting in class in college because he was the only racial/ethnic minority in the room. Yet, he has not allowed this to deter him from academic success. Correa continues to go to events on campus and he makes it apparent that he is a low-income, first generation college student. Correa became actively involved in Dartmouth’s First Year Student Enrichment Program. This program enables first-generation students to become used to the college environment. With the help of the director of the program, he became acquainted with the resources Dartmouth has to offer, which helped him in his transition into the new environment. Correa’s mother reminds him to ignore the connotations placed on him because of his race. He continues to give back to Hempstead High School students by returning to discuss Dartmouth and the college application process.
“While in college, it’s very important to focus on yourself and not where everyone else is at,” Correa said. “I know that’s a very difficult thing to do, but it is also important. The only person you should compare yourself to is your older self.”
Karen Lopez, the 2014 Valedictorian from Hempstead High School, is a senior at Columbia University, majoring in economics. She was born in El Salvador and came to the United States when she was eight years old. She is now happily living in the city. The transition from Salvador to the United States was difficult for her because English wasn’t her first language. As time passed, Lopez practiced English with the help of her third grade teacher. Fast forward to senior year, Lopez realized how challenging the college application was for her. She focused on Ivy League schools because of the need-based financial assistance. The competitiveness of applying to these schools drove her hunger to become intellectually challenged.
“Focusing on Ivy Leagues and coming from a school like Hempstead High School was hard in itself because I found people doubting me. I didn’t have too many people to look up to. I couldn’t speak to my parents about the stress of the process and I couldn’t look at anyone else in my family because I was the first one to consider going to college. This truly tested my perseverance as I questioned myself many times if I was good enough to go to a top college,” she said.
Lopez felt intimidated at first when she visited colleges and it was difficult for her to find her voice in a new environment. She saw that there weren’t many students with her racial background at the top Ivy League schools. This has driven her to work even harder in her school work to show that she can make it in life, regardless of where she comes from. Although it took her a year to embrace her culture at Columbia University, this was the time she needed. She decided to join Latinxs, a student organization on campus. This transformed her whole college experience.
“I realized that while I did like being exposed to different people, I also needed the space to spend time with people who looked like me and who were facing similar struggles. Through this organization, I met some of my closest friends and started to learn a lot from them about Latinidad and what it meant to be trailblazers in our communities,” she said.
Dondre Lemon, a junior journalism major at LIU Post who is black, was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts and moved to the Bronx when he was six months old. The transition from the city to Long Island was difficult for him when he arrived at Post.
“When I first arrived on campus, I did feel different from the other students because the majority of the students were from Long Island and I was a city kid that didn’t know certain topics students would talk about,” he said. Although this took a toll on him when he started at Post, his passion for unity of cultures drove him to become more interested in reporting and journalism. Lemon has demonstrated to professors and others that it depends on the individual, not the color of their skin. People would not have guessed that Lemon was a reporter in the Bronx while he was in high school. He demonstrated excellence by receiving an award for his reporting skills and by publishing two articles with the nor news. Lemon is a staff writer now for the LIU Post school newspaper and the creator of the new PTV- Pioneer news show. He is thankful for the support system that has helped him with his transition to the college environment.
“Almost every professor helped me in some way. A lot of them definitely made the transition easier for me and warmed me up to the campus. I definitely know my success coach helped a lot, making me feel comfortable, if I had any problems; I know I can go to her for anything. Having friends has also helped me, and what makes it better for me is that I am meeting new people of different cultures, which I feel everyone should have in their circle of friends,” he said.
Next year, Lemon will take an editorial position on the student newspaper. He continues to be an inspiration for students coming from low socio-economic backgrounds who may lack confidence in their abilities.
Lemon believes that the negative stereotyping and labeling needs to change. “The first thing I do is tell my friends of color not to classify any group. Don’t say all whites this, or Muslims that. Right now, we need to be together and be united, no matter the color of your skin,” he said.
As a reporter, Lemon wants to show others that they do not have to have a high socio-economic background or grow up in a wealthy community to make it in any career they desire. “If I can inspire one person that they can make it just the way they are, I will definitely feel like I have made a difference in the world,” he said.
Amoy Brown, 2016 graduate of Hempstead High School, is now a sophomore at the University of Albany, with
an English major and journalism minor. She was born in Jamaica and moved to America when she was five years old. Brown has also felt like an outcast in a college that’s predominately white. Growing up in Hempstead, people had expectations of how she is supposed to behave. However, she proves them wrong.
“My skin color is something that I have definitely became more conscious of,” she said. Also with the world today, it’s kind of hard to do anything without thinking about the barriers that race does cause.”
In Brown’s college environment, she has noticed instances in which she was the only black person in her class, but she didn’t let this hold her back. “Just because I’m more conscious of it now doesn’t mean it makes me any less confident in who I am or what I do,” she said
With this confidence, Brown has taken advantage of what the university offers. She noticed how UAlbany celebrates cultures. She found various organizations that help empower people of color like herself. She joined an organization called the Black Theater Production, which promotes the performing arts for people of color. In addition, Brown was awarded a journalism internship with the student affairs media team. She also joined an organization called “Her Campus,” an online magazine where she can express herself.
Tibian Ahmed, a senior at Stony Brook University, was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Ahmed, who is Muslim,
has encountered many instances when she has been racially profiled and has felt like an outcast, especially during her years of schooling.
“As early as elementary school all the way through my now final semester at college. It’s happened at work, my internships, even in personal settings meeting some of my non Muslim friends’ parents,” she said.
At times, in social settings at school, Ahmed has felt tested because of the comments made about her. She noticed how students would take pictures of her and make fun of her while she was sitting in the dining hall. People would also taunt with her hijab. Ahmed was the only girl who wore the hijab at her first school, SUNY Brockport. “People would purposely work in groups of three so that they wouldn’t work with me,” she said.
Ahmed has had uncomfortable situations with professors as well. During her freshman year at SUNY Brockport, students were assigned a 10 page research paper and the professor gave the topics to the students. The professors gave her, ‘Should the U.S Iraq war have started?” She was the only student assigned this topic. She had no choice but to comply with the professor’s request. In order to make this assignment unbiased, Ahmed made sure she asked other students if they thought the war should have started. Towards the end of her presentation, the professor stated her own biased opinion.
Ahmed has encountered other moments when professors would make thoughtless statements about Islamic terrorism or extremism and try to convince her that her hijab is an inconvenience. Also, professors at both colleges she attended have asked her how the process was for her family coming to the United States as refugees. Ahmed felt as if they were committed to setting a low standard for her by assuming she wasn’t American. Ahmed had to overcome these situations on her own because her parents didn’t have the same experiences. Because her siblings are significantly younger, they too didn’t understand what she has gone through. Ahmed also realized the significance of the date September 10, 2001, the day before 9/11. This was the day she placed her hijab on for the very first time, when she was six years old.
Although she has faced criticism, Ahmed used this to elevate herself in school instead. She began interning at CNN. She interned with white men who were middle aged and she noticed how they had a different tone with her as she stepped in to contribute.
“I get it, because they didn’t experience people like me. This is a pattern; this is how they have been taught to think, and it’s a bigger issue. It’s unfortunate, you are at a point where you can think for yourself but they chose not to, people chose not to challenge themselves because it’s more convenient for them,” she said.
Before transferring to Stony Brook, Ahmed became a speaker for the diversity conference at her first school, SUNY Brockport. She spoke out to faculty members and students about her life growing up post 9/11 and her experiences. Ahmed also founded the MSA (Muslim Student Association), which tries to bring a Muslim friendly environment to students, holding events about Islam awareness and reaching out to non-Muslim students on campus about their experiences growing up on post 9/11.
“It’s either I was going to do something to make myself feel like I belong there or just let it get to me,” Ahmed said.
At Stony Brook, Ahmed has become an executive producer for Newsbreak En Espanol and also an EOP success coach to mentor students on time management, critical thinking and writing skills.
“Don’t keep yourself in a bubble – what scares you the most is the most important thing to challenge yourself with,” she said. “You need to be respectful and make sure you are not a part of the problem.”
These students, like so many of their peers, have overcome prejudice and stereotyping by working hard and demonstrating excellence. The issue has not gone away and needs to be further addressed in our communities today.
Until then, let’s continue to work hard and demonstrate that we are all the same. It’s time to stand up and remember we are all dreamers. Let’s make the labeling stop and make America great again in this way.

Editor’s Note: In light of recent mass shootings in the U.S., the Pioneer is republishing the university’s guidelines and protocols issued in Feb. 2017 as a public service for the school community.
There have been 317 mass shootings in the United States, close to one every day, in 2017, according to the Gun Violence archive. The harsh reality of mass shootings is that they could occur at any place and anytime. Since 1999, there have been 31 mass school shootings in the United States, which have made worldwide headlines and devastated school communities. The massacres at Columbine High School, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and Virginia Tech University, among others, have led schools, including LIU Post, to strengthen their security protocols and strategize if it were to happen to them.
The LIU Post Department of Public Safety includes 22 full-time, New York State certified security officers. It is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors on LIU Post’s campus. The department works with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments, and the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management. The Public Safety Department created its own guidelines in early 2017, based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s “Active Shooter: How to Respond” booklet, which includes emergency phone numbers and tactics. The guidelines are on the university website at http://liu.edu/cwpost/Public-safety.
According to the university guidelines, “because active shooter situations are often over within ten-to- fteen minutes before law enforcement [or Public Safety] arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared both mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.” Within that time frame, the guidelines suggests to “take note of the two nearest exits,” “secure the door [in the room],” “if in a hallway, get into a room and secure the door,” and as a last resort, “attempt to take the shooter down.” If an active shooter is in your vicinity, the guidelines call to “escape if possible,” and “hideout where the shooter is less likely to find you while [remaining silent].” If you are the first person to call 911, the guidelines suggest to provide the phone operator with as many details possible, including location of the shooter, the number of shooters, if more than one, physical description of the shooter(s), number and type(s) of weapons, and number of potential victims at the location.
Michael Fevola, who became the Director of Public Safety in August 2017, said his team would rely on text messaging and emails during active shooter situations, although he has not experienced one on campus.
“In the event of an incident including an active shooter, Public Safety has protocols in place and the ability to immediately alert the entire campus community via a mass text/email blast with specific advisements and instructions,” Fevola said. “Those messages can also be used to continuously update the community, alert individuals what areas they should stay away from, and what to do, including the “Run/Hide/ Fight” protocols.” The Pioneer reported that the “Run/Hide/Fight” protocol was instituted in February 2017. “[It was] not in response to something happening, just to keep the campus safe,” Dr. John Lutz, English professor and chair of the faculty council, said in The Pioneer’s article, “Stop, Drop, Roll” published on Feb. 15, 2017. Lutz said, at the time, that faculty members had expressed an interest in learning more about campus procedures during an emergency, which led to a meeting for faculty on Feb. 1. At the meeting, Paul Rapess, the former director of Public Safety who retired last summer, discussed the new procedure, which implemented to keep up to date with happenings.
The Public Safety department routinely conducts joint training exercises with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments on campus. With this training in place, local police have a better feel for the campus during emergency situations.
According to LIU Post’s CampusFirearms & Weapons Policy, which is available on the LIU website under ‘University Policies,’ says “the possession of dangerous weapons, including any pistol, revolver, an incendiary bomb, switchblade, dagger or bludgeon, as well as harmless instruments designed to look like weapons are prohibited” on campus. “Other than police officers or military personnel on active duty, no person, including a licensee, may possess rearms anywhere on campus, whether in a building or on the grounds, without the prior written permission of the campus Provost and Director of Public Safety.” Violators of this policy will be subject to immediate disciplinary action and potential criminal prosecution. LIU Post strictly enforces its campus gun policy. As The Pioneer reported several years ago, on Nov. 17, 2011, a 72-year-old criminal justice adjunct professor accidentally shot himself in the groin and leg before his class. Although he was a retired Fire Marshall licensed to carry a weapon, the no weapons policy on campus was strictly enforced and he no longer teaches at LIU Post.
Katherine Hill-Miller, English professor and former dean of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences suggests every student and staff member should sign up for the Public Safety alerts, and said she would follow direction from Public Safety in an emergency.
“My first action would be to check for the text message and follow its directions,” Hill-Miller said. “If a message hadn’t come through, I’d assume that the incident hadn’t been reported, so I’d dial 911 first and then call campus security. Barring any information from anybody, I’d evaluate the situation—if the shooter was close, I’d gather students away from windows and doors in the classroom.”
Freshman education major Amanda Iovino agrees that the public safety alerts would come in handy in times of danger. “The texts are very useful in times of bad weather, and I think if [a school shooting] was to happen, the texts would be crucial.”
Fevola advises students and staff members to always be alert to their surroundings. While school shootings do not happen very often, he stressed that anything could happen, and one person reporting a suspicious person could potentially save lives.
“Stay vigilant and follow the old adage ‘see something, say something,’” Fevola said. “Any odd or unusual behavior should be reported to Public Safety, and we always protect [the] anonymity of the caller.”

Long Island University President Kimberly R. Cline’s contract was extended an additional six years, until Dec. 2023. The Board of Trustees announced the contract extension to the campus community by email on Thursday, Nov. 16. Eric Krasnoff, Chair of the Board of Trustees, wrote that President Cline’s contract was extended due to her “outstanding accomplishments” since her hire in July 2013.
As the 10th President of LIU, Cline has helped to improve the university “academically, financially, and in the involvement with the communities we serve,” Krasnoff wrote in the email. Since Cline’s start, the university’s endowment has reached $200 million, she has secured over $100 million in scholarships, and has implemented a number of programs to “move the university forward,” he added.
But just how did she do it?
“Success is derived from strategy,” Cline said in an interview with The Pioneer on Nov. 22, elaborating on the “Strategic Plan,” a collaborative plan focused on academic excellence, a secure and sustainable financial position, an expanded culture of community engagement, a vibrant and distinctive student experience, and recognition as a “best value” institution by 2020.
Several of these goals outlined in the Strategic Plan have already been met, Cline said. New programs such as international relations and diplomacy, sports management, and nursing complete with the new simulation lab, have been successful in the short time they have been implemented, she said. Students are able to experience a “robust student life” with events across the university, at Tilles Center for Performing Arts, and with the Global Institute that expand their perspectives and invite them to think on higher levels; and the university has secured a stable financial footing, she added.
Yet students and faculty have raised concerns.
The Faculty Council, composed of LIU faculty members, sent a four page letter to the New York State Education Department (NYSED) on June 28, which provided an overview of “violations of accreditation standards, shared governance, questionable financial operations, and mismanagement of student support services.” The Faculty Council followed up its initial letter four months later with a 284 page report detailing the charges against the administration and Board of Trustees. The larger document, created by Faculty Council President and English Professor John Lutz and several other members of the Faculty Council, was filled with supporting documentation for NYSED.
“These issues are a sign of a breakdown in the communication process,” Lutz said. Many faculty are feeling that the “shared governance,” which is a collaboration between faculty and the administration to best serve the education of students, within the university is beginning to crumble. “Faculty don’t feel like their collaboration is meaningful [to the administration] in a lot of areas,” he said. “Faculty interact with students every day, we have a point of view on what students need and it hasn’t been considered.”
Yet, Cline stated, “I am an over-communicator,” despite faculty complaints about a lack of transparency. “I want to make sure that people do feel that they know what is going on and that they feel comfortable with it.” At senior administration meetings, Cline has begun to include the new deans in the conversation, and the idea is that they in turn will communicate to the department chairs, and then the chairs to the faculty and so on.
“There are conversations going on all the time, yet conveying an adequate point of view is difficult,” Lutz said, expressing faculty frustration.
“Our faculty is deeply committed to providing students the transformative liberal arts education that [our] mission statement celebrates,” Willie Hiatt, associate professor of Latin American history, said.
“However, we continue to have deep concerns about university leadership and how it is affecting our financial and intellectual vitality.”
Among the many issues brought up within the document submitted by the faculty to the state education department, there have been several violations that jeopardize accreditation in key programs, according to Hiatt. Majors, programs, and support have been cut without consulting the faculty. Staffing deflects and a lack of institutional support in areas such as LIU Promise mean that the university is failing in its commitment to student success and degree completion, faculty members state.
President Cline did not respond about the allegations in the NYSED document specifically, yet on the topic of LIU Promise, and in light of the editorial written by the Pioneer’s Editor in Chief on Nov. 1 about her experience with her success coaches,“Switching to 120 Credits: My Nightmare,” Cline admitted that the LIU Promise office is in transition. “When I first brought this promise program, the first year I was very engaged in it. At some point it started to pivot from its birth.” Cline said she is beginning to work with Promise again, in order to return it to an area of continuous outreach and engagement. “We [would like] to have [coaches] individually tailored to the student,” she said. “It’s not always going to be perfect.”
In regard to the cutting of majors and programs, Cline said the programs that were eliminated were “undersubscribed” with “zero- to-two” students occasionally. “It’s unconscionable to try and teach someone by themselves in those programs,” she said.
Enrollments over the past four years have been “struggling,” according to both Lutz and Hiatt. “We’ve had declining enrollments,” Lutz said. “This fall, the incoming class enrollments went up [from 500 to 701], but transfers and graduation numbers went down.” Hiatt added, “The administration has failed to solve LIU’s enrollment crisis and has not sustained the level of fundraising necessary to provide students the scholarships and support services they deserve and desperately need.”
Cline disagrees. The university has secured over $100 million in scholarships, and that does not include the scholarships from various donors such as the Sanford scholarship or the Winnick scholarship, she said. She has also convinced the Board to keep tuition increases at 2 percent until 2020 to keep tuition affordable. “The goal is for 100 percent graduation rate – a little unusual, I know, but when you have students that are passionate about the university, and really want to be at LIU, we want to be there to see them through.”
Hiatt believes that the timing of Mr. Krasnoff’s decision to extend President Cline’s contract appeared “premature at best” since the board has yet to acknowledge, address, and hold the administration accountable for these failings or to do anything to fix these problems raised by faculty. Both Cline and Lutz have confirmed that an ad hoc committee of the board received the faculty document sent to NYSED a week and a half ago, and has agreed to meet with faculty and speak about the concerns addressed in the document once they complete a review. A meeting date has not yet been determined.
“There are many hardworking, talented faculty, administrators, and staff at Post, and we’re all dedicated to improving the experience of students and preparing them for flourishing personal and professional lives,” Lutz said. “Faculty and administration sometimes have differing points of view about how to do this, but students should trust that we will work out these differences to provide them with a meaningful education.”

“Beginning in the 2019-20 academic year, LIU will compete in all sports at the NCAA Division I level, with a unified athletics program that will join our campuses into One LIU,” university president Kimberly Cline wrote in an email announcement to the LIU community on Wednesday, Oct. 3, halfway into the fall 2018 season, and two weeks after the academic add/ drop period deadline on Sept. 18.
“The unification of the Division I and Division II athletic teams into a more robust Division I program will have long term benefits for LIU and the Northeast Conference from an athletic, academic and community standpoint,” NEC commissioner Noreen Morris said during an LIU press conference at the New York Athletic Club on Oct. 3.
Along with seven Post sports teams being elevated from Division II to Division I, the LIU Post basketball (men’s and women’s), women’s bowling, women’s fencing, softball, women’s swimming, track & field (men’s and women’s), and women’s volleyball teams will move to the Brooklyn campus, where a multipurpose athletic facility will begin construction in 2019. New women’s ice hockey and water polo teams will be added in Brooklyn.
The LIU Post football team will move to the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), the lower of the two Division I levels. Football players are excited about the change, as they will not be losing their positions. LIU Brooklyn has no football team, and their stadium will be renovated to meet Division I regulations.
The announcement, which emphasized the unity of the individual athletics programs into “One LIU,” has rocked student athletes on the Post campus. For many of the Pioneers, this is not exciting news.
All Post sports teams play under the NCAA Division II, as they have since their inception. The sudden announcement of the transition to Division I in the middle of the current season has caused distress and uncertainty among many Post athletes about their future athletic and academic careers. Post students will have to re-tryout for positions on the new Division I rosters, competing with current LIU Brooklyn students and freshmen recruits for those same spots next year.
Sports that are combining include basketball (men’s and women’s), soccer (men’s and women’s), baseball, softball and women’s lacrosse. The men’s lacrosse and men’s cross country will move to the Northeast Conference.
Ashley Melendez, a senior childhood and early education major, was one of the unhappy students on the softball team. “We could not believe the news. We were all heartbroken that this selfish decision was made without even speaking to any of the athletes,” she said. “We were completely blindsided and devastated that this selfish act is going to break our family apart.”
An FAQ page posted on Oct. 3 on the new one.liu.edu, or athletics.liu.edu website addresses questions about the change. The question of Post athletes being able to continue their positions in the Division I teams has student athletes most concerned. According to the site, the athletics department “will personally work with each individual student-athlete to review all potential opportunities athletically and academically within the new athletic department.”
Newsday reported on Wednesday, Oct. 3 that, “LIU teams will draw athletes from both campuses,” but, “the 2019- 20 rosters will be decided at the discretion of each team.”
Many Post athletes, who qualified for Division II sports, fear they will not make the new teams. “There’s a chance that we might get cut. We don’t know anything; we don’t know
if we are going to keep our coach. We literally have nothing,” Jillian Lomanto, a junior education major and member of the lacrosse team, said. Without further information, Lomanto believes nothing about their team will remain the same.
The method and timing of the announcement were questioned by students and faculty. Many athletes feel underappreciated. “When the president announced it, she didn’t take the athletes’ feelings into consideration. She literally just said this is fine, she’s getting paid for this. It’s the athletes who are getting hurt right now,” Lomanto said.
The students are also concerned about their coaches. “It’ll be very hard if my coach is not the same coach [for women’s lacrosse]. If she’s [Coach Megan McNamara] not the coach, none of us are going to be playing,” Katelyn Politi, a sophomore elementary education and special education major, said.
International student-athletes were especially concerned. Those who were recruited internationally were either signed into a contract to play in Division II, or can only play in Division II based on their semi-professional athletic careers in their home countries before enrolling at LIU Post. Multiple Post teams, such as the women’s and men’s soccer teams, have rosters comprised of mainly international players.
The unified sports teams will have an even bigger impact on campus. The school’s colors will change from the Pioneers green and gold and the Blackbirds blue and black, to a unified blue and gold. The cost of replacing and redesigning the signs and facilities, including the upgrade of both campus athletic facilities, the Bethpage Credit Union Stadium and new uniforms, apparel and signage on both campuses, could be high.
The Bethpage Credit Union Stadium will receive a makeover, with upgraded grandstands to improve sight lines for fans, and to meet Division I standards. “This project will make Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium among the most modern facilities of its size on the East Coast and provide an ideal game day environment for our student-athletes and supporters,” according to a statement on the athletics.liu.edu site.
Roy Fergus, the director of facilities services for both campuses, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the timing, execution and price of these projects.
Unifying the university athletic departments under Division I could help increase the profile of the school, as LIU’s administration stated in the statement announcing the change, however it will come with sacrifices, according to multiple students and faculty members.
“What’s stunning about the LIU announcement is the consolidation of sports from two autonomous campuses, one Division I and one Division II, with different colors and mascots, and telling roughly half the 1,600 student-athletes that they’ll no longer have an athletics future at LIU,” Willie Hiatt, associate professor of history, said. “We’re forcing them to compete against each other for roster spots. I can’t imagine that a ‘Hunger Games’ scenario like that happens very often.”
Hiatt believes there was an unspoken reason for the merger. “The timing of the announcement also was a slap in the face to athletes. The slick ‘One LIU’ branding didn’t happen overnight,” he said. “Why didn’t the administration make this announcement at least last spring or summer to give students the chance to find another school? With another small freshman class of 550 students or so, was this to avoid worsening our enrollment crisis? And why do this after the add/drop period? If we care about our students, we should allow them a full tuition refund if they choose to leave LIU right now. That’s the least we can do. If I were a parent, I’d be asking for that for my child,” Hiatt said.
Lacrosse player Politi agrees with Hiatt on the timing. “I don’t think [the administration] did it in the right way,” she said. “Especially for people recruited over the summer. They didn’t tell them and [the recruited students] make decisions [on where to go to school] and they had no idea that they were going from a D.2 to a D.1 program, which is a huge difference.”
Students and faculty believe that the change had been planned for some time. “If they knew about [this change] for years, they should’ve told us the summer of 2018 so people had time to digest this new information, instead of telling teams during and right
before their seasons,” Veronica Saager, a junior special education major and member of the women’s soccer team, said.
“If I was a freshman, I might look into transferring,” Lomanto said.
Student athletes are still debating their next steps. Students have created several protests on social media, including a petition that now has over three thousand signatures and a not.my.liu.post Instagram page that has over 400 followers.

“The School for Good and Evil” by Soman Chainani is the first book in a fantastic fantasy series. This first book tells the story of best friends Sophie and Agatha, living in the isolated town of Gavaldon. Every four years on November 11, according to legend, a School Master kidnaps two children from the village. One kidnapped child is always beautiful and kind, and the other is homely and odd. These children are taken to the School for Good and Evil, which exists somewhere beyond the woods surrounding Gavaldon. The children are never seen again, unless they appear in a fairy tale, one as a hero and the other as a villain.
Sophie, who is beautiful and focuses on her looks and good deeds, believes that she will be kidnapped for the School for Good. Meanwhile, Agatha, who is ugly and wears only black, doesn’t believe the School exists but seems like the perfect candidate for the School for Evil. They are the two kids who are kidnapped by the School Master that year. However, Agatha is brought to the School for Good, and Sophie to the School for Evil. What first appears to be a great mistake turns into an adventure that not only reveals the character’s truest selves, but also blurs the lines between the stereotypes of good and evil.
Along the way, Sophie and Agatha meet the other students, who are descendants of fairytale characters. The best friends from Gavaldon take classes at their mismatched schools while they try to solve a riddle the School Master gave them that will lead them home. However, the School Master is more than what he seems, and has a different ending in store for Sophie and Agatha.
“The School for Good and Evil” is a very entertaining book, but the plot doesn’t go far beyond the school. Although this series takes place in a much larger world, the first book takes place only in Gavaldon and the School. The world of fairy tales is supposedly endless, but readers don’t get to experience much of this world in the first book. One must read the rest of the series to see more of this magical world of Good and Evil.
In “The School for Good and Evil,” nothing is as simple as it seems. It is a great read for those who like dramatic twists and sneaky foreshadowing in their books.

In “Smite,” we are introduced to Ullr: The Glorious One. In the game, Ullr is designed in heavy robes and a hood, he also wears a bow and arrow and his twin axes. As a hunter god that lives in the frigid north, this design could not be more fitting.

There are many gods in Norse mythology, but few are as highly regarded as Ullr, “The Hunter God of Glory.” In both mythology and in “Smite,” Ullr doesn’t represent the boastfulness or shameful satisfaction one gets from seeing others fall. He is honorable and pays respect to true glory in all its forms.
For Ullr, glory is in the silence of snow fall, the perfect curve of a bow firing an arrow, the honorable victory earned in single combat and the moment of life’s rebirth. In Norse mythology, “The Hunter God of Glory” is an enigma ever keeping to himself. In “Smite,” Ullr is secretive and knows that true glory lies in remote hideaways, untouched by the hands of time, and it is in these very hideaways the shrines to Ullr can be found.
Ullr is highly respected even among the gods, for it his him and not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the all father is away. While other gods would abuse the power the throne brings, Ullr knows that his rule is an extension of Odin’s will.
The mythology states that Ullr is a skilled archer and an expert in close combat; this is no different in “Smite.” In the game, Ullr’s attacks and abilities revolve around his skills as a hunter. His passive ability is called weapons master; this allows Ullr to switch between fighting with his bow and his axes, and it is here that we see Ullr’s true skills. With his bow, Ullr’s abilities allow him to attack multiple
enemies at once while his axe-based abilities are for single combat.
Ullr’s second ability is called expose weakness. This allows Ullr to land critical hits easily. Just as his mythology counterpart finds glory in a bow firing an arrow true, Smite’s Ullr is able to find the perfect shot without hesitation.
Ullr’s ultimate is called Wield Axes; with this Ullr gains additional physical strength and lifesteal which allows him to deal more damage to a single enemy. This ties in to his mythology as it tells how Ullr finds honor in single combat and pays respect to his fallen foe.
While not much is known about Ullr, “Smite” does a good job of paying respect to his mythology and gives us a character that is both accurate and fun to play with.

On Tuesday, Nov. 13, Amazon announced that it would move its new headquarters to New York City and Arlington, Virginia; the corporate giant also said that it would invest about $5 billion, and each location would see around 25,000 new job openings. Sounds good, right? Well, there is another side to this story.
Corporations usually decide to locate in areas with sturdy infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and reliable transportation, so they can operate effectively. Ac- cording to The New York Times, Amazon was given $2 billion in tax subsidies for its decision to build facilities in these locations. Why is it that one of the nation’s most prosperous companies was just given $2 billion?
The answer is simple: Amazon is just one example of an alliance between the business class and the political class. Amazon’s decision to move one of its new headquarters to New York City is no accident, as the city is run by Mayor Bill de Blasio, one of the most liberal mayors in the country. Big corporations often lobby before Congress and give contributions to the politicians; in turn, the politicians give favors to the corporations.
Unfortunately, the Right has defended large corporations for years. Corporate America, however, hates the idea of free markets and competition, which are conservative ideals: according to The Daily Beast, a left-leaning website, “That’s because they have the resources to hire the lawyers needed to navigate regulations, and the lobbyists who can help change the rules if necessary.” Companies like Amazon end up becoming monopolies, and competition from small business is crushed. There is nothing conservative about this practice, just as there is nothing conservative about most big corporations. It is just the opposite: they are the backbone of the Democratic Party.
If you were to check the donor lists of Democratic candidates like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, you would find that many large corporations often donate generously to Democrats. According to AlterNet, the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, gave over $300,000 to Hillary Clinton in the last election.
For all the yammering we hear from Democrats about the evils of corporate America, they certainly have no problem taking donations from large corporations for their political campaigns.
The Republican Party deserves some blame, too: in order to satisfy the business interests that fund their campaigns, establishment Republicans often are silent on the issue of illegal immigration and border security, as they want to provide cheap labor to their corporate donors. A mass influx of low-skilled labor often puts downward pressure on the wages of Americans. Many on the Left are right to say that corporate America deserves some skepticism; the problem is, they are enabling the very practices they claim to be fighting against.

The name Mia McLeod will go down in women’s ice hockey program history. On Tuesday, Oct. 8, the Sharks received their first player recognition in the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance as Mia McLeod was named “Rookie of the Week.”
The Canadian received the award after a well-deserved weekend of play. In the Sharks’ inaugural opening night against University of Connecticut, McLeod faced 53 shots and made 49 saves. This left the freshman goalie with a save percent-age of 93 percent after her first night of play. 
Head Coach Rob Morgan had been watching Mia in net since his days coaching at Yale University. He had first seen her play at the age of 14, and once Morgan was named the head coach at LIU, “it was a no brainer,” about bringing McLeod to come play for him, he said. 
McLeod began playing hockey at the age of eight, but didn’t become a goalie until she was 10. The first time she tried the goalie position, McLeod was hooked.L “You do rotations as a goalie and everyone gets a chance and it was my turn and I just kind of stuck with it. I liked it and I felt kind of good at it,” McLeod said. 
As a five-sport athlete in high school, Mia McLeod is no stranger to a highly competitive environment. She competed in cross country, volleyball, hockey, track, and ultimate Frisbee. 
“Ultimate Frisbee was really fun, I had never played it before and then I started in grade ten and it was just something to do on the side, and it was really fun,” McLeod said.    
With hockey at the top of McLeod’s list of favorites, track and field came as a close second of the sports she’s participated in. McLeod also competed as a pole vaulter for three years in high school. 
“It was something different to do than hockey but just learning how and flying in the air in pole vaulting was really fun,” she said. 
The Sharks have left their footprint in Division I Ice Hockey as they became the first ever program on the island. However, for McLeod and her squad, it hasn’t been an easy task. The Sharks’ biggest challenge for both coaches and players is having such a young team. With 23 team members, 21 are freshmen. The other two players are transfer students that came in as a sophomore and a junior. “Usually, it’s your seniors that will set the tone or raise the bar because it’s their last year to try and win. But right now, they have four years to win. We want to have that mindset that we are a team that can win our conference every year,” Coach Morgan said.
McLeod also feels the pressure of having a young team. However, she reminds herself that they are making history. She believes that she and her team can take their skills and strengths and win a conference championship. 
On Friday, Oct. 18, McLeod and her team will take on reigning National Women’s Ice Hockey Division I Champions against the University of Wisconsin Badgers at their home arena in Syosset, New York.

The 2019-2020 women’s ice hockey team is the first in program history, and it is also the first Division I ice hockey program on Long Island. Head Coach Rob Morgan put together a team he believes will continue to make history. “I recruited every kid and everyone was recruited here for a reason, not just to fill a jersey, but to be a part of something special,” he said. 
The Sharks opened their season with an exhibition match against a professional women’s ice hockey team, the Metropolitan Riveters. The Sharks lost in a 10-3 battle, however they saw it as a great game to prepare them for the regular season. “Getting that first look at the kind of talent, speed, and strength we will be up against this season was an awesome learning experience,” junior captain Morgan Schauer said.
The Sharks officially kicked off regular season play with two games against University of Connecticut. While the Sharks lost in back-to-back days to the UCONN Huskies, the games showed the determination and potential they have in games to come.
In the first game against UCONN, freshman goalie Mia McLeod stood out, making 49 saves on 53 shots. A week later, McLeod made history as the first LIU ice hockey player to win conference recognition, as she was named “Rookie of the Week.” In the second game against UCONN, freshman forward, Carrigan Umpherville scored the first goal of the regular season for the Sharks. 
The early season schedule is made up of some extremely challenging games, including reigning NCAA Division I champions University of Wisconsin. The team played University of Wisconsin on Friday, Oct. 18 and Saturday, Oct. 19. Before the game, Coach Morgan said he expected a tough game, but that nothing is decided beforehand. “I know how good they are and our team knows how good they are. But the outcome is determined after 60 minutes. So, we are gonna go out there and play our hardest and give them a good game,” he said.
The Sharks fought hard but fell in both games with the scores of 2-10 and 0-12. However, the team is taking these games as learning experiences, according to freshman captain, Matilda af Bjur. “Playing against the best is an indescribable feeling. We have a way to go to get there, but it is a journey me and the team are ready to do,” she said.
Junior captain, Morgan Schauer, also had a positive outlook on the loses to the Wisconsin Badgers with the belief that these games are “going to make us stronger and help us to build up our program.”
In addition to play against high ranked teams, one of the biggest challenges the team has faced is the youth across the team. Twenty-one out of their 23 team members are freshmen. “It’s a pack of puppies running around,” Coach Morgan said. 
Without seniors on the team, Morgan said the team lacks the looming sense of a “last ride” among seniors. They don’t have the mindset that this is their last year to win. “Usually, it’s your seniors that will set the tone or raise the bar because it is their last year to try and win. But right now, they have four years to win,” Morgan said. 
Up next for the Sharks is two games against Coach Morgan’s former team, Yale University. The games are being played on Friday, Oct. 25 and Saturday, Oct. 26.

Sammy Bell, junior psychology major, is a forward on the field hockey team, as well as the team’s leading scorer. During her time playing as a Shark for the fall 2019 season, Bell scored nine goals and 20 points throughout the 14 games the team played. 
Bell hails from Scotland and started playing field hockey there when she was seven years old. After playing field hockey in high school, Bell decided to attend college in America and chose LIU after Head Coach Raenee Savin got in contact with her. “Coach Savin reached out to me and I had never been to America before so I was very excited,” she said.
Bell played the previous two seasons with the Post Pioneers. As a freshman in 2017, she co-lead the team in assists, and along with 11 goals, she finished third on the team’s scoring list with 35 points. In 2018, Bell was second in all three categories with 16 goals, seven assists, and 39 points. 
Bell had a slow start to this season, but between Sunday, Oct. 13 and Friday, Oct. 25, she scored six goals in four games, including an overtime goal against Sacred Heart University, her second that day. Bell said the reason for her recent success is due to her team. “They have been hyping me up and playing better to win and want me to do well,” she said. Bell has also taken 62 out of the team’s 155 shots this season. She thanks senior midfielder and team captain Taylor Brodsky for that statistics. “Taylor is the reason I have many shots, as she is able to set me up for good scoring opportunities,” she said.  
Brodsky predicts Bell will have a big impact in the upcoming games. “She’s a big part of our team and we rely on her a lot,” she said. Bell is a great player with a humble attitude, but she needs pushing from her captain, according to Brodsky. “She needs to be pushed a lot but she is a very humble player and it’s been an honor to play with such a good field hockey player, and especially to be the person that pushes her every day,” she said.     
Junior goalkeeper Rachel Vellis is one of Bell’s close friends and said that she loves to see her score. “She is my best friend and gets me really hyped up. It gets me excited when I hear the echo from the other side of the field,” Vellis said. She also said that Bell is a strong presence on the field and brings a lot of energy.  
Coach Savin has coached Bell for three years and said she has seen her develop from a freshman who wasn’t prepared for the amount of conditioning collegiate field hockey requires, to one of the team’s most valuable players. “The summer after her freshman year, she made a huge adjustment, which helped prepare her for the great season that she had last year,” Savin said. “Sammy has been a huge asset for our team and we need her to keep putting the ball in the back of the net because very often we come out on top when she’s scoring.”  
Going forward, Bell and the field hockey team play their last games of the regular season on Friday, Nov. 1, against Fairfield University and on Sunday, Nov. 3, against Temple University. The Sharks will then prepare for the NEC Tournament since the team secured a spot in the playoffs with a 1-0 win over Bryant University on Sunday Oct. 27. They are the first Shark team of the new Division I program to claim a playoff berth. The NEC championship tournament is being hosted in Staten Island at Wagner University on Friday, Nov. 8 and Sunday, Nov. 10.

Women’s rugby’s sophomore forward, Sydney Long plays an important role as one of the team’s top players. The team won their last game of the fall season, over Molloy College with 27-12, and Long led the team in tackles and scored a try. Long also scored tries in three other games throughout the season.
The rugby team finished their fall season with an overall record of 2-6. Long says it was a “growing season” for the team as it was the first time in program history they were able to play 15 vs. 15 competitions. She also mentioned the younger members of the team, as there are only six upperclassmen out of 18 players. Long said it took some time for the team to work through different concepts and to come together. 
However, Long is very proud of how the team united towards the end of the fall season. “At the end, we finally pulled it together and we worked really hard and we did really well our last three competitions,” she said. 
The LIU rugby team is not a member of the NCAA, rather they are a part of the NIRA, the National Intercollegiate Rugby Association. Because of this, when the university announced the merger be-tween NCAA Division I and Division II, it did not directly affect the rugby team. However, Long says their team has felt positive impacts of the university’s move to Division I. “We get the prospects of the upgraded athletic training room, obviously the money for scholarships, and the money for new gear,” she said. “So that was a really big help this year.”
Long, a Tennessee native, came to Long Island to work towards pursuing a career in the FBI. “I want to be in the FBI, and I thought that the biggest police hub, in my mind, was in New York. So, I knew I wanted to come up north and be as close to a big hub as possible,” she said. Long said that rugby brought her to LIU, but the FBI was the long-term goal she had in mind. 
Long started playing rugby late in life. Having played her first year of rugby as a junior in high school, she said it wasn’t until October of her senior year that she actually began to think about pursuing a collegiate rugby career. However, even with coming in very late in the recruiting process, Long said she “made it work.” 
Looking towards the spring rugby season, the game format will switch to 7 vs. 7, leaving eight of the fall’s previous starters on the bench. “Not everyone’s gonna get to start now. So, I think a big thing for us is just continuing being a family and not let that divide come between us,” Long said. 
Academically, Long is currently undergoing the process of obtaining a summer internship with the FBI at either a location close to her home in Tennessee or at their home base in Quantico, V.A.
Looking toward the future, Sydney Long has big goals. In the short-term future, those goals include a successful spring season with the rugby team and a call back from the FBI.

With new colors and a newly combined team, the bowling team is back on the lanes with their goal set on winning the Northeast Conference trophy.
The team has a total of 13 bowlers, six from the Post campus, four from the Brook-lyn campus, and three newly recruited freshmen. Leading the team is Head Coach Kayla Jones, who previously coached the Blackbirds for seven seasons. She lead the Blackbirds to their first ever conference championship in 2016 and broke the program record for wins the following year with 75 won games. 
Coach Jones said she didn’t know what to expect when she first heard of the announcement of the merger of the Post and Brooklyn campuses and that there was a fear of the unknown. “Change is scary, and of course, this was a major change,” she said.
Despite the uncertainty, Coach Jones said her team handled the transition well, both on and off the lanes. “The girls get along very well off the lanes and I believe each day on the lanes we get better at communication, cohesion, and helping each other be the best we can for the team,” she said.  
Coach Jones also said the unification made the team stronger and generated depth. “It’s a comfortable feeling knowing we can change someone in and out,” she said. “Having a lot of talent is a good thing because each player brings something differ-ent to the table and that is what makes us a stronger team.”
The Sharks have an overall record of 21 wins and 12 losses, being 7-3 in conference. Coach Jones said the conference the team plays in is very tough, with six teams ranked among the top 25 in the nation. “It’s strong competition every weekend, every match,” she said. 
Junior bowler Emily Cavanaugh was a top competitor on the Pioneers’ bowling team the previous two seasons and she hopes to show that the new team can perform this season. 
“As a team we hope to prove people wrong; that we can overcome the obstacle of the merge and come together as a strong, winning NEC team,” she said.  
The team’s biggest event this season was the Northeast Conference meet in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Nov. 9 and Sunday, Nov. 10. The team left the meet with five wins and one loss, which earned them first place in the league. 
Senior bowler Tyler Karpinecz played for the Blackbirds last year and experienced her team falling short in the NEC Conference Championship, something she wants to prevent from happening again. She sees this year’s team’s recent success at the NEC meet as a positive indicator. 
“Going 5-1 and being placed first right after the first NEC meet is something that will only motivate us to keep that spot,” she said. “The Sharks are hungry this season and there’s nothing stopping us.” 
The Shark’s next competition is the UMES Hawk Classicon on Friday, Nov. 22 to Sunday, Nov. 24 in Millsboro, Delaware.

Update – On Wednesday, Oct. 14 an additional 20 cases were reported on the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, bringing the total number of reported cases since Oct. 10 to 33.
Editor’s Note – The Pioneer chose to keep quotes given to us by athletes anonymous out of respect for their privacy.
At least 14 students have tested positive for COVID-19 due to off campus gatherings attended by several members of various athletic teams, according to an email from Chief of Student Affairs and Alumni Engagement Michael Berthel on Sunday, Oct. 11. 
The affected students and individuals who they were in close contact with are required to quarantine for two weeks. Anyone who is in a class with a student who tested positive has been notified, according to the email. The email also states that the university will be disinfecting all impacted areas, but does not specify what areas on campus have been affected.
The university shared the email with students and staff when they became aware that off campus gatherings had occurred, according to Berthel.
“The University immediately coordinated its response with the Department of Health. We are working in close cooperation with the Department of Health on contact tracing in accordance with their Contact Tracing Program, and notifying all students and faculty who are in classes with these individuals,” Berthel said. “Anyone who had been in contact with these students would have been notified by this point.”
The incident comes soon after the NEC announced winter athletics we’re supposed to start on time on Nov. 25.
On Saturday, Oct. 10, 11 positive cases were reported on the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, bringing the total number of reported cases for the two week from Sept. 27 to Oct. 10 to 19. On Sunday, Oct. 11 a new two week period that will last until Friday, Oct. 23 began, with a total of 13 positive cases being reported thus far. It is unclear how many cases are directly related to the gatherings.
All athletics have been paused for one week, and several athletic teams are currently quarantining as precautionary measures, according to Berthel.
One student athlete of a team not involved in this incident was upset because their practices have been cancelled for at least a week. 
“Everyone has been working super hard to be able to practice again, and because of a party it’s all on hold again,” they said. “None of us even heard of a party or anything and then next thing you know it’s shut down.”
The university currently has 85 students in quarantine, and 39 out of the available 50 quarantine rooms are currently in use, according to the New York State COVID-19 Report Card website.
Some athletes are afraid to speak out about the situation, fearing possible negative consequences.
“Athletes are being quiet about this incident in fear of negative repercussions from the athletic department,” one athlete said. “Although their information could be the difference between life and death to students with underlying health conditions.”
Disciplinary action against the students who attended the gatherings is being considered, according to Berthel. No details about what consequences may occur are known at the moment.
Some students, such as senior psychology major Nicole Ludwig, feel that the university needs to do a better job with enforcing social distancing guidelines on campus.
“The school needs to do more than send text messages and emails to enforce social distancing guidelines,” Ludwig said. “I’ve seen so many students walking around with their masks either below their noses or completely off without any consequences, and have even seen giant groups of friends eating together.”
In his email to the community, Berthel urged the student body to follow the university’s social distancing guidelines. 
“I understand that this pandemic has required sacrifice and you yearn for the social and emotional connection that has become synonymous with your LIU experience. We want that for you too,” the email stated. “However, the stakes are too high and we cannot take chances. Remain vigilant, renew your commitment to keeping yourself and our community safe, and act in a manner that demonstrates a genuine concern for your peers, your faculty, and your loved ones.”
Berthel would like to see the university have no new cases, which is something that can only be possible if students follow the universities COVID-19 guidelines.
“LIU will continue to respond immediately to positive cases when or if they occur. The positive test rate on campus is below county and state levels, but the university goal is to have zero cases,” he said. “All members of the LIU community are reminded to adhere very closely to LIU’s health guidelines: wear a face covering at all times when in public spaces on campus; practice physical distancing, do not gather in large groups; complete the daily health check-in; wash your hands regularly; stay home when you’re sick and seek immediate medical attention if you’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.”
Senior psychology major Sarah Ren, feels that while the university has done a good job regarding their COVID-19 protocols, the university’s dashboard does not provide enough information to keep the campus community informed. 
Ren would like to see the dashboard include the total number of cases the campus has experienced since the beginning of the semester. She feels that only showing positive cases from a two week period makes the situation appear less serious then it might otherwise be if the total number of cases were shown, and that students would be less likely to break social distancing guidelines if they had all of the information. 
Senior broadcasting major, Matthew Valentino thinks that the behavior displayed by some students is unfair to commuting students who have to put their families at risk.
“Now the students who commute and have to come on campus, but also be around their parents, or possibly grandparents, are putting themselves at risk, and everyone else around them at risk as well,” he said. “All because these kids want to have their college experience.”
Ludwig understands that the students who attended the parties most likely wanted to have a normal college experience, but thinks that what they did was reckless and dangerous.
“I think it’s very selfish to be trying to go to a party right now. I know so many people feel robbed of their college experience, and I can empathize with that, but your college experience isn’t going to mean as much to you if you find out someone you love has died from COVID,” she said. “And the longer we refuse to follow guidelines, the longer it’ll take for things to return to normal. To not follow the rules is to openly admit that you do not care about the safety of yourself or other people, and I don’t have any respect for that.”

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic illness that affects millions of families each year. According to the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, PD is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. Modern medicine and neurologists have been developing stronger and more effective treatments for this disease every year. 
Dr. Gemma Moya-Galé is a professor at LIU Brooklyn  and speech-language pathologist who researches PD. Her expertise can be most notably witnessed in her recently published article “The effects of intensive speech treatment on intelligibility in Parkinson’s disease: A randomised controlled trial”, where she discusses the newfound breakthroughs in the use of intensive speech treatment to improve speech intelligibility for those with PD.
“Our study was the first one to examine conversational intelligibility gains in a randomized controlled trial for PD and we were able to provide evidence of treatment benefits to improve that aspect of their lives. The clinical implications for this are, therefore, huge,” Moya-Galé said. 
Moya-Galé’s goal is to improve the quality of life in her and her colleagues’ patients. Her study that was published by the Lancet took six years to complete, and contained documented and verified research supporting both Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD) effectiveness, as well the importance of physical activity. 
“Close to 90% of people with PD develop voice problems over the course of the disease. One of the most devastating consequences patients face in their quality of life is social isolation and withdrawal, given that they lose the ability to be understood, particularly in noisy environments. Once voice problems have appeared and worsened, many patients may decide not to partake in conversations anymore, out of frustration, for example.” 
In order to get a better understanding of the disease itself, Moya Galé elaborated on what exactly the nature of the disease entails.
 “The disease is progressive and it may start long before a diagnosis is made, loss of smell could actually be one of the first signs. Getting the right treatment is crucial, as many times modifications to medication have to be made based on patients’ reactions to it.” 
LSVT LOUD treatment, is the most well researched and understood kind of treatment used to treat individuals. The LOUD part of the treatment, refers to patients using their loud voice, and emphasizes use of sounds like “AH” at various pitch tones, in order to rehabilitate their speech. 
“[LSVT LOUD] is currently the gold standard in the treatment of hypophonia in PD. It also has decades of research behind it that show its benefits in improving not only voice, but also facial expressions, or even swallowing,” she said. 
Moya-Galé said that LSVT LOUD has significantly improved intelligibility and patients with PD’s ability to be understood. This is important because there is a gap between the communication levels of the patient with PD and their caregivers. Improving the communication between the patient and the caregivers will improve the overall mental well being and stability of those with PD because they will know that they can still speak clearly enough to be understood. 
Moya-Galé believes that exercise is also essential to improving the neuroplasticity in patients with PD. Neuroplasticity is the concept that the brain can still learn, improve and remain malleable even within the patient’s final years being alive.
 “Physical activity not only improves aspects like balance and walking, remember that people with PD are at a greater risk of falls, so addressing these problems is very important for overall safety, but it can also increase quality of life, for example, by fostering and prolonging the individual’s independence,” she said.
Moya-Galé urges those with PD to begin rehabilitation as soon as possible.
“Rehabilitation is key in PD, and the earlier someone starts receiving those services (including physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and such) the better. Rehabilitation services undoubtedly improve quality of life and we, as therapists, advocate for their early implementation,” said Moya-Galé. 
While she does hope there will be a cure in the traditional sense, she still noted that there are factors within our control that can prevent the disease interfering drastically with the patients lives. 
“As for habits or factors that could have a protective role; exercise is key. Physical activity has tremendous benefits …  not just for maintaining good physical function but also cognitive function.” 
Moya-Galé continues to study PD and work as a speech pathologist in order to foster independence in patients so that they can keep their voice for as long as possible.
Her work not only continues to impact the lives of not just her patients, and their families, but the scientific community, who research PD and attempt to learn how to effectively treat those who develop PD, at any stage of their life.
For more information about speech therapy treatments for PD, refer to Moya-Galé’s research on “The Lancet”.

All classes at Post were moved to remote instruction for a period of two weeks as of Oct. 15. University President Kimberly Cline sent out a mass email to the Post community stating that “Last weekend, a small number of positive cases were reported as a result of off-campus social gatherings that violated LIU’s Code of Conduct. Additional cases were reported over the past few days by students who were in contact with students at the gatherings. Most of these cases were contact traced back to these isolated events. Some students, who have not tested positive, have been asked to quarantine.”
    There were a number of students who were required to quarantine because they had been in contact with a student who had coronavirus or tested positive themselves. These students were notified about the matter and moved into Suffolk hall to carry out their isolation. 
“I didn’t prepare for quarantine,” senior psychology major Tiana Ono said. “We got the news last minute that we needed to get tested. One of our friends is an RA and she’s the one who told us that we were being put in quarantine that night so to start packing. I didn’t get a call until around 8 to 9 p.m. from someone at the school telling me to get out of the dorms. So I had a few hours to pack and grab food and stuff, everything moved very fast.” 
Similar sentiments were shared by senior sports management major Emily Poole. “We did not get much time to prepare. We were told pretty late about the quarantine in a different building so we just packed essentials quickly and moved in,” Poole said.
    Food is delivered to our door by resident assistants and Promise employees.
“The food is pretty basic but as an athlete it’s hard not being able to control what foods we eat,” Poole said. “We get plenty of food and snacks but the quality and healthiness is not the best but we don’t go without so that’s good.” 
    Both students shared that the quarantine has had a slightly positive effect on their studies. With plenty of free time and no distractions from peers or activities, they have had more time to study and do their school work. Ono has found solace in the contact and regularity that her classes offer. “Class throughout the week has been helpful since it gives me something to do,” she said. “Weekends feel very long. It also sucks that we can’t even go outside for a walk or something.”
Poole had a similar opinion of her time in quarantine. “One good thing about this quarantine is that it has been around midterms so plenty of time to study,” she said.
    Poole expressed the difficulty being in isolation. 
“Quarantine is a pretty big mood killer. As an international student this is not my first time doing this but it is so mentally and physically challenging,” she said. “Not having the comforts of your own room, the heat and wifi have not been working great, the air in the room gets stuffy and not getting any fresh air, a walk or exercise is so tough. My fellow quarentiners and I joke that the first few days go by slowly, a week goes by and you think ok that wasn’t too bad but by day 10 you are climbing the walls.”
Ono agreed that being alone all of the time is difficult. “My mood comes and goes. Sometimes I’m happy, sometimes I’m angry, and sometimes I want to jump out of my window. I also wish that they would let us go outside for an hour or something. It really sucks being locked up in a room for a long time.”  
Ono and Poole both tested negative for coronavirus, but were required to quarantine due to being in close contact with individuals who tested positive.

The Scottish actor Sean Connery has died at age 90 in his sleep. His career spanned for seven decades and he was best known for his portrayal of James Bond. 
Connery became a top box-office star in both Britain and the United States in 1965 after starring in “From Russia With Love,” “Goldfinger” and “Thunderball.” He would go on to star in seven of the Bond series films. More than Agent 007, Connery went on to play a widower obsessed with a woman who is a compulsive thief in Alfred Hitchcock’s “Marnie” and as an amoral poet in the satire “A Fine Madness.”
Throughout his career he acted in more than 60 movies, leaving behind a legacy that many believe will last forever. 
“He was an amazing actor and his continuations to the medium are astounding,” Senior marketing major Anthony Cavarretta said. “He taught us how to play it cool as Mr. Bond and he is one of the main reasons Indiana Jones and the last crusade is my favorite movie of all time.” 
Connery died in the Bahamas, surrounded by loved ones after feeling unwell for some time according to his son, Jason Connery. Connery’s wife, Micheline Roquebrune, would later add that he had struggled with dementia before his passing. 
Senior arts management major Brianna Savarino said ”He was a super talented actor. Everyone knows the line, Bond, James Bond.”

This year marked a historic moment within the NASCAR Cup Championships. Chase Elliot took home first place earlier this month in his eleventh victory of the series.
Elliot captivated his fans, following in his father’s footsteps, Billy Elliot, another Cup series champion.
Freshman adolescent education major Ryan Kaim was enthusiastic about Elliot’s championship win. “Overall, Phoenix put up an unexpected champion and a fan favorite when it seemed somewhat unlikely through 2020,” he said. 
The unexpected victory comes as a surprise to fans and other drivers who seemed to have a greater chance of winning. 
Denny Hamlin and Kevin Harvick initially dominated in this year’s series. Those racers were eliminated from the playoffs after compounding weaker results than the other drivers, making  them unable to qualify. 
This year, Phoenix Raceway in Phoenix, Arizona, hosted Championship Weekend. This marked the first time the city has ever hosted a championship race. 
The final race was not looking great for Elliot in the first half. However, Kaim thought he did a fantastic job playing out the remainder of the race. “Chase Elliot started from the rear after his car failed inspection twice, but he clawed through the field and led near the halfway point, dominating through the remainder of the race, taking the checkered flag,” Kaim said.

On Thursday, Sept. 30, the music department was given breaking news: the music education major is being frozen. This means that any incoming student at Post may not choose music education as a major, but the students who are already part of the program will be able to finish out their degree.
More news came for other arts students soon after. On Oct. 8, students in the department of theatre, dance and arts management received word that recruitment into the dance and arts management programs would freeze after this school year. 
With programs freezing, students are left wondering if they should stay at Post and what the future holds for their education.
“We got an email from Dr. McRoy who is the director of music education. He wasn’t beating around the bush at all. He just said ‘unfortunately the school has decided to freeze the music education major,’” sophomore music education major Ally Perticone said.
A large majority of the students found out this information while they were in chorus class.
“We were in chorus and everyone’s jaws dropped. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. After all the time and effort we put in,” senior music education major Kaitlyn Sottung said.
The music education majors and their faculty have worked hard to build their program.
“I want the administration to know that people are hurting. It’s not only us, it’s also the faculty. I feel very bad for everyone in my department, especially the faculty because I know how much hard work they put into this. I see the hard work that everyone puts in,” sophomore music education major Mike Shapiro said.
Students in the program thought that  all of their hard work and effort was paying off, especially seeing as the university advertises the music program on various media platforms.
“I think it’s just really unfair. The school portrays their music program and all the opportunities we have here as this great big deal, which it is,” Perticone said. “It’s a really good program we have here. But I hate that they portray it as something bigger than it is. If it’s so great, why are they getting rid of it?” 
There is even a banner on campus stating that Post was rated the best music school on Long Island.
“This program is so near and dear to me and to watch it be ripped away from future students is heartbreaking,” Sottung said.
Some students hope that others will join them in trying to fight for their program, while others think there’s no chance of restoration.
“When they took away the Fine Arts Center (FAC), we were able to advocate for ourselves and help restore the program by having the school put practice rooms in Hillwood. So, I think if we really get the word out and talk to higher administration to fight for our program, it might help,” Shapiro said.
“I personally think that fighting for it isn’t going to work. This is not something we can change their minds on. I don’t think it’s worth trying for,” Perticone said.
The next steps for the music program are unclear at this time, as students and faculty alike continue to grapple with this sudden change despite the decision that the school’s administration made. It’s clear the music community on campus is still strong, and will continue to focus on their craft as long as the school’s administration allows them to.
Students from the dance and arts and administration department are also fighting for their programs.
Junior dance major Abby Steinke recalls all of the opportunities she has received through Post’s dance program.
“We’ve had the opportunity to see companies and work with artists that are high calibre. We’ve been able to choreograph ourselves, like I’ve gotten to choreograph and make my own artistic voice show,” Steinke said.
Steinke says that the Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC) is like a family. She doesn’t think she would be the person she is today without it.
Steinke and the rest of PCDC found out Friday Oct. 8 that their program was to be frozen at the end of the year.
“I was shocked,” Steinke said. “The first thing I wanted to do was be like, okay what can we do to stop it? I’ve been emailing administration, and I messaged the theatre company to email them. I think strength in numbers really works. I think if everyone has something to say about it, then they should listen.”
Steinke has some ideas on how to get the campus’ attention, other than emailing.
“We’re thinking of doing some video things, maybe some flash mobs. The dance program has a big presence in the department, but we need to make that known to campus,” Steinke said.
Steinke believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on this decision. She says that last year the dance program was meant to bring in 13 new students, but ended up only bringing in three. 
“I think we need a chance to grow as a program through the pandemic and not getting a chance seems unfair,” Steinke said.
Steinke’s next steps are getting as much attention as possible from as many people as she can.
“Email your president, email Promise, email your dean, email our dean, email chairs; email anyone you can. These programs are important and they are bringing more people to this school. They are bringing culture to this school, arts to this school,” Steinke said.
Steinke urges the administration who is cutting these programs to listen to the students.
 “Please listen to the student body, please listen to what we have been sending you, please reconsider the freeze,” Steinke said.

The ongoing uncertainty around whether Brooklyn Nets’ star Kyrie Irving will receive a COVID-19 vaccine has overshadowed the Nets’ start to their season, which Irving cannot currently participate in due to his status.
Irving cannot play in Nets’ home games at Barclays Center in Brooklyn unless he receives the vaccine due to the NYC requirement that you must be vaccinated to attend or participate in any indoor entertainment spaces. The Nets later announced on Tuesday, Oct.10, that Irving will not play for them at all this season until he becomes eligible to fully participate.
The Nets’ guard was not forthcoming about the situation, calling into the Nets’ media day via Zoom. 
“There’s just a lot of questions about what’s going on in the world of Kyrie, and I think I’d love to just keep that private and handle it the right way with my team and go forward together with a plan,” Irving said.
Kyrie would lose the entirety of the $35 million he was supposed to make this year if he sits out the whole season.
Senior broadcasting major Nicholas Paniagua is concerned about how the Nets will play while Kyrie is ineligible.
“Missing Kyrie is definitely going to hurt the Nets because Kevin Durant needs another star player alongside him in order for him to play his full game,” he said.
Paniagua, like many, feels that Irving’s looming absence severely limits the potential for a championship season. He predicts that the Nets advance no further than the Eastern Conference Finals without Irving’s services.
“He is a good enough player to join just about any team and immediately make an impact,” Paniagua said, 
Brooklyn Nets star guard Kyrie Irving is continuing his holdout over New York City’s vaccine mandate. The team’s Sunday, Oct. 24 home opener saw a lively anti-vaccine protest take place on Irving’s behalf, with protesters chanting “let Kyrie play” and “I’m with Kyrie.” Protestors at one point broke through the barricades, forcing security to rush to the doors to prevent the crowd from breaching Barclay’s Center.
Paniagua is surprised at Irving’s continued decision not to be vaccinated against COVID-19. 
“I really don’t understand why he has such a negative view of the vaccine,” he said. “I get that people have bad reactions to it, but a lot of other players got the vaccine, and here they are still playing basketball.” 
During postgame availability following the Nets’ second loss in their first three games, superstar forward Kevin Durant was asked again about Irving’s absence.
 “Nobody is going to lose confidence while we’re playing and hope Kyrie comes to save us,” he said.
Durant left the Golden State Warriors, where he won two NBA championships to team up with Irving and the Nets. 
Nets’ guard and former MVP James Harden, who was acquired by the Nets via trade after the arrivals of Durant and Irving, has struggled with his play so far this season. Harden typically improves his conditioning as the season progresses but is also adjusting to new NBA rule changes that affect his playing style. The league office has set out to eliminate actions by offensive players which are done solely to cause the referee to grant a foul. Harden has long been the best drawer of fouls in the league, attempting the most free throws per game every season from 2016-17 to 2019-20.
With the Nets off to a 2-2 start, the clock is ticking on Kyrie Irving’s return. Until he joins the team, Durant and Harden will shoulder a heavy workload.
Brooklyn has clear championship aspirations; the team was eliminated last postseason in overtime of Game 7 against the Milwaukee Bucks in the second round. Milwaukee went on to defeat the Phoenix Suns in the NBA Finals.

ESPN’s Monday Night Football (MNF) broadcasts are shaking up by introducing a secondary broadcast featuring the National Football League’s favorite brothers, Peyton and Eli Manning. Starting this NFL season, the Manning bros will host their own show during 10 of the 16 Monday Night Football games, bringing in guests to help commentate on ESPN’s second channel, ESPN 2. Dubbed the “Manning-Cast,” the show has been nothing but successful and has seen its ratings climb each and every week.  
The success of the new Manning-Cast challenges the traditional style of NFL broadcasting and suggests that it may be time for a change. The almost century-old style of broadcasting football games may not be the best way to engage fans in the game anymore, especially the highly coveted younger audience. With the NFL focused on engaging younger and diverse audiences, a new broadcasting style similar to that of the Manning-Cast could be the secret to reaching this target audience. Clearly, the Monday Night Football broadcast between the two beloved NFL legends has the potential to shake up the sports broadcast landscape. 
Traditionally, the NFL broadcast consists of a play-by-play man along with a color commentator, with the play-by-play usually being an individual with broadcasting experience, and the color commentator being a former coach or player who can provide insight into the minds of the coaches and players. These two individuals help guide the audience through the game, providing commentary on what is happening while also conveying additional information that might interest the fans. 
The MNF broadcast between the two NFL legends is structured a little differently, as the brothers cover the game from separate locations, using a Zoom-style format to connect with each other and the guests. Throughout the course of the game, Peyton and Eli cover the game, analyze the highlights, and interview a variety of guests, ranging from current and former NFL players and coaches. This format gives the brothers more freedom to crack jokes, go off on rants, and entertain the fans without having to stay focused on calling each and every play of the game. 
The Manning-Cast has been met with near-universal praise by fans across social media, as many praised the brothers for their on-air chemistry and unique football knowledge. 
As stated by Ryan Boettcher, a Junior Broadcasting major at LIU Post, the Mannings provided a more “information-based knowledge towards the game,” while also having that “brother rivalry which led to a ton of comedic moments.” Boettcher admitted that he preferred this Manning-Cast over the traditional ESPN broadcast, citing that the conventional was more for the “casual fan,” while the new broadcast provided “more of a laid back broadcast for the knowledgeable fan.”
While Boettcher and a majority of fans were crazed about the Manning-Cast, some weren’t as intrigued. Like most things, it only takes one Twitter search to find sharp criticism about MNF’s newest broadcast. From brief technical issues to problems with the format and commentating from the brothers, critics had plenty to complain about. Mike Fiorio, an analyst for NBC, went as far as to say the broadcast was “unnecessary” and made the game “generally hard to follow.”  
It has been no secret that the NFL has been trying to reach a younger and more diverse audience while also retaining the die-hard fans that help make it the most successful sports league in America. Over the past few years, the NFL has expanded their presence on social media, launching the Playmaker’s Program on Instagram, and expanding their football coverage to Facebook, Amazon Prime Video, and even Nickelodeon. They have also continued their efforts to expand the league globally, playing two games in London this season, and approving at least four international games per year for future seasons. 
With the NFL putting an emphasis on expanding their audience, the success of the Manning-Cast shows that the answer to their woes might be in their broadcasts. In its limited time on-air, the Mannings have captivated the sports world and have drawn more attention and viewership each week. This early success indicates that it may be time for a change in the sportscasting industry, as the old way of broadcasting may not be the best way to reach a wider audience. 
Bob Costas, a long-time NBC broadcaster, suggests that the Mannings success may not be able to be replicated, as the dynamic between the brothers makes the broadcast so entertaining. Without that chemistry, alternate broadcasts could struggle to reach “the Manning level.”
While Costas may be skeptical, the Manning-Cast has opened the door for a new form of sportscasting and has made a splash in a nearly century-old industry. With the success of the Mannings’ broadcast thus far, the NFL will undoubtedly explore this further, as having alternate broadcasts to their primetime games could be the key to reaching new audiences and expanding the game we love.
While the Manning-Cast wasn’t perfect by any means, the overwhelming amount of praise and media attention shows there is plenty of support, which is a good sign for the future of this new alternate broadcast, and any others that may follow.

Emotional support animals have become increasingly popular among college students in the last few years. The idea of having a pet as means of emotional support, and helping someone get through something, has become more common in recent years.
As of 2019, there were 200,000 emotional support animals in the United States, many of which are dogs. This number is up exponentially since 2014, when there were only 2,400. They are classified as service dogs, since they are used to assist people with their mental health.
When a puppy is trained to be an emotional support animal, the training can take anywhere from 14 to 24 months.
Certain emotional support animals, classified as psychiatric service dogs, can only be obtained by individuals who fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
However, any other person can obtain a regular pet that can double as their emotional support animal.
“An emotional support animal to me is a pet that comforts you through your trials and tribulations. Emotional support animals help with academic stress, as well as depression and anxiety that comes from coursework throughout the semester,” junior theatre arts major Gabriella Beckman said. 
Many college students feel anxiety and elevated stress throughout their semesters, and feel that emotional support animals could help.
Post currently allows students to have emotional support animals. According to liu.edu, “It is LIU’s policy to permit Service Animals, as defined below by the Americans with Disabilities Act, in all approved campus areas; and it may permit Emotional Support Animals (Support Animals), as a reasonable accommodation, in the residence halls for students with a documented disability.”
“They help with stress, anxiety, and just managing emotions,” sophomore nutrition and dietetics major Amanda Battista said.
Emotional support animals can be a tool for anyone who has a psychological disorder and needs an emotional companion, as well as just the average person looking to have a stress reliever in their life.
“I feel as though an emotional support animal could help me tremendously. Whether it be the support animal sensing an anxiety attack, or just taking a break from life to just be with your support animal, it would help,” Beckman said.
Beckman and others agree that emotional support animals should be allowed in college dorms because of the support and aid they can give students.
“I love them. I would say that they should be allowed as long as they are specifically trained to be an emotional support animal,” Batista said. “They would have to go through special training where they are taught to understand human emotions, as well as not bark and disrupt other students in the dorms. I think there should be a separate dorm section for them, and that some sort of doctor’s note should be used as well.”
In today’s age of mental health awareness, emotional support animals are being touted as a tool to help not only the depressed, but also the average person.
“Honestly, the campus should have emotional support animals for everyone. It’s proven that they help people control their emotions and just relax,” Battista said.
With the popularity of emotional support animals continuing to rise, many questions arise, such as how schools will react to and accommodate an influx of students bringing emotional support animals to college with them.
Many also wonder how other institutions will react to people having emotional support animals.
The U.S. Army does not allow emotional support animals on military bases because they are not classified as service animals. However, if a soldier lives in their own apartment, they can have any type of pet they want.
Many questions will arise in the following years about how accessible emotional support animals should be to the public, as well as where they should be allowed. It is up to institutions to decide how these animals should be accepted.

From Friday, Sept. 30, to Sunday, Oct. 2, the Sharks women’s golf team competed among 16 universities in their third competition of the season at the Navy Fall Invitational. 
The Sharks finished fifth as a team. However, out of 88 total competitors, it was Sharks’ senior Emily Byrne who came out on top. Her 2-over-par score of 146 was three strokes ahead of the second-place finisher, Anna Ferreyra-Heit from Delaware State. 
This is Byrne’s first season at LIU after playing three years at Limestone University in South Carolina. 
Byrne was also the Sharks’ top performer over the first two events of the season. At the Delaware State Fall invitational on September 19-20, Byrne finished fifth individually, only one stroke away from tying for first with the other top four golfers. 
In the week leading up to the Navy Fall Invitational, Byrne finished first for the Sharks at the Boston College Intercollegiate. 
Byrne is from Liverpool, England, but knew for many years she had a goal of playing golf in the NCAA. 
“I’ve been playing golf for about 10 years now, and ever since I was about 14 or 15, I had friends who were coming over here and started playing college golf,” she said. “Then, when I got to about 15 and 16, I set my heart on playing golf and then getting to the collegiate level.”
With a combination of her athletic and academic plans in mind, Byrne had her heart set on coming to the Big Apple to finish her collegiate career. 
“I was down in South Carolina, and I decided I wanted to change and started looking in terms of location to be a business major,” she said. “I wanted to head up to New York, and then I started looking around this area and found LIU. I looked at the team, then started communicating with the coach and decided it was definitely the school for me.”
Bryne knew it was going to be important to make an impact early on in her playing time here at LIU, and she could not have wished for a better outcome. 
“It’s amazing, I’m just on cloud nine right now. Coming over here, I didn’t know where my golf was going to be. I had quite a big injury over the summer, and I was not sure if I was going to be able to play at the level I knew I could,” she said. “After I got here and had all the encouragement from the team and all the support I needed, to come and play really well is big for me.”
Despite the conditions of the long weekend, Byrne credits her performance, along with that of the team, to the perseverance they have shown so far this season.
“We had very bad weather the whole time. We had the back end of the hurricane, so we just wanted to get through and stay as dry as we could,” she said. “Just knowing I had to get through it and stay strong mentally helped it.”
Byrne was named a Northeast Conference (NEC) Prime Performer for the month of September. She could not have been more thrilled for the honor.
“I was really shocked and just couldn’t have expected this first month to go any better, so I’m excited to see the rest of the season and see how I do,” Bryne said.
Bryne looks to capitalize on her success early on at LIU and collectively carry it throughout the rest of the season.
“The goal is definitely to win the conference with the team we have and a great set of girls who have the ability to do it,” she said. “Personally, I just want to enjoy the last two years that I have of college golf with a great team.”

On the first day of classes, your professor will often hand out a packet either physically or digitally titled “Syllabus.” The syllabus is a contract between the professor and the student outlining the student’s responsibilities, and what rights they have access to. Many students will often take a glance, review it with their professor during class, and shove it into their backpack for it to never be seen again. The other portion of students may read through it to better prepare for their class. 
Students can expect to find important information such as resources, deadlines, classroom policies, and contact information for office hours. In some instances, a student might find money. 
In an entrepreneurship course, one professor hid a message within two of his class’ syllabi. The text read, “There is one envelope in Dean Fusaro’s office with $40 in it. Just ask her and it’s yours. The first student from the class that finds it gets it.” 
Entrepreneurship professor and CEO of Sage Marketing, Daniel Klein, explained why it’s important for students to read the syllabus.
“I think it’s very important because it tells them how to do well in the class, so to me the syllabus is the instructions for how to do well,” Klein said. “I would hope that students would at least glance at it or look it over. Mine are very specific, I’ll give them all the rubrics for any midterm, any finals. I’ll tell them exactly what they need to do to pass the class — I want the students to do well, I’m going to show them how to do well, and all they have to do is read it.”
Out of everyone in Klein’s classes, only one student came forward to claim the prize. Freshman business administration major Talia Romito was the first— and only— student to secure the forty dollars hidden within the syllabus. 
“I definitely think you should read your syllabus. It helps me personally a lot just to get an idea of the classes you’re going into and just prepares you for your year to come,” Romito said. “I’ve always read my syllabus since high school and I plan to continue doing so throughout my four years here.”
Even after professors emphasize the importance of their syllabus, students still tend to ignore it or not look through it carefully. 
“I think students skip reading the syllabus because it can be long and overwhelming,” Klein said. “You need to know where to look. If I were a student I would definitely look at the rubrics if there are any in there. It’s a bit overwhelming because a typical syllabus is twelve or fourteen pages long.”
Reading the syllabus is often looked at as being responsible for knowing what’s going on in the class. 
“I feel like I went in [to class] like I could answer some questions based on the syllabus,” Romito said. “I kind of knew what my professor was talking about. — gives you an advantage going into the class, you’re not going in blind.”
Hiding money within the syllabus is not something professors typically do, but Klein found it to be an interesting way to see if his students were reading the material.
“I saw that a professor at another college did something like this and I just thought it would be fun to test out to see if anyone would find the money,” Klein said. 
“My initial reaction was confusion… Why did it say to pick up forty dollars in the dean’s office?” Romito said. “At first I thought it was a joke, I actually didn’t pick it up until four or five days after, because I thought it was just a joke and didn’t want to go and embarrass myself. So one day, I asked Professor Klein after the end of class, and he said no it’s not a joke and no one has picked it up so go pick it up you deserve it. Then, I realized it was real and it was pretty cool, I felt proud.” 
In the eyes of an entrepreneur, a couple of lessons can be learned from this experiment. 
“My classes teach entrepreneurship, one of the keys of entrepreneurship is knowing when to look out for opportunities that other people don’t see. So as an entrepreneur, if you find out or figure out an idea before other people, that can be your whole business. I want to teach them through experiential learning that there are opportunities everywhere, where you least expect it. That’s why I hid it inside the syllabus,” Klein said.
“I think that if you’re given the opportunity, take it,” Romito said. “I had the opportunity to win forty dollars and I was hesitant at first, if I didn’t go and see if it was real, I would have never won the money. So I say go with your gut and take the opportunities presented to you.” 
Seeing how this lesson was mostly entrepreneurial, how could a professor in another field of study take this type of experiment and apply it to their course?
“I would suggest that they could put something like this in some of their content where students would have to find the certain information and then the professor would know that they are not just reading information and taking a test, but they’re really understanding the content that they are doing,” Klein said.
In the future, Klein’s students may be more inclined to read their syllabi.

Many storylines were going into the MLB playoffs this year. The Dodgers were going into the playoffs with an incredible 111-win regular season. The Mets and Yankees returned as the NY baseball powerhouses. The Seattle Mariners broke the 21-year streak of no playoff appearances, and it was the last ride for the St. Louis Cardinals’ big three in Albert Pujols, Adam Wainwright and Yadier Molina.
For the Wild Card Round, The Mets came into the last week of the season as world series threats and locks for the NL East title, but that all changed in their final three-game series against Atlanta. The Mets had their best three pitchers for that series and could control their division title destiny and avoid the wildcard round as a two-seed in the National League (NL). However, this was not the case, and they had to host a three-game win-or-go-home series against a struggling San Diego Padres team. The Padres were hit hard this season with their star Fernando Tatis Jr being suspended for performance-enhancing drugs (PED’s). So going into the playoffs, all the Padres had was Manny Machado and newly acquired Juan Soto as major bats and a deep starting rotation and bullpen. This Wildcard series was the first of many upsets, with the Padres winning in Queens due to a pivotal game three performance by Padres’ starting pitcher Joe Musgrove. He put up 5 K’s and only one hit in his seven innings of work, which set up the 6-0 shutout victory. 
The Padres had a bunch of people step up in this series, with Trent Grisham hitting homers in back-to-back games and Josh Bell adding a bunch of clutch hits.
The Mariners finally broke the 21-year playoff drought and were faced to play the Toronto Blue Jays. The Blue Jays hitting was evident throughout the series, with multiple home runs from Teoscar Hernandez in game two, but the underdog Mariners wouldn’t go down for the count, winning the first game in a 4-0 shutout, then sealing the deal with 10-9 victory in game two. The Mariners were down as much as six runs, but still prevailed. Seattle was guaranteed a home playoff game for the first time in over two decades.
The Philadelphia Phillies closed the book on the last ride for the St Louis Cardinals’ legends in a 2-1 series victory. The red birds took game one in demanding fashion with a 6-1 win on the backs of Mike Mikolas’ five strikeouts and Corey Dickerson’s three RBI’s. However, the power bats of the Phillies overwhelmed St.Louis in the next two games.
The youthful Cleveland Guardians swept the Tampa Bay Rays thanks to pitching performances by Shane Bieber and Triston Mckenzie. Beiber and Mckenzie both fanned eight batters in their starts. Game two was an outright pitching duel going 15 innings with a combined total of 39 strikeouts, the most ever in a postseason game, capitalized by a 15th-inning walk-off by Oscar Gonzales. The Guardians were able to complete the sweep and head to the division series.
The Division Series was filled with upsets and close games. The best team in the league, the 111-win L.A. Dodgers were upset by in-state foe San Diego Padres in four games due to big performances like Yu Darvish’s seven strikeout outing in game two, homerun from Trent Grisham in game three and an eight strikeouts performance from Joe Musgrove in game four. 
The Yankees prevailed in a five-game series win over the Cleveland Guardians. The Bronx Bombers were down 2-1 in this series and had fans on the edge of their seats as they had to win two straight to stay alive in the playoffs. Harrison Bader was up for the challenge by hitting three home runs in the series and Gerrit Cole’s eight strikeouts in game four. 
The Atlanta Braves were out-slugged by the Phillies in four games. Philadelphia bats were on fire, hitting nearly double (24) the amount of RBI’s that Atlanta hit (13). 
Sophomore undeclared major–and longtime Braves fan–Eric O’Neil was stunned by the Phillies’ upset.
“There was no answer for the Phillies’ offense. Every ball hit off the bat was either a home run or a base hit,” he said.
Bryce Harper showed up big time for Philadelphia with two homers and five RBI’s in the series.
The Houston Astros swept the Seattle Mariners. The Astros re-established their dominance over their AL West rival. The Astros came back down three runs with a walk-off homer by Yordan Alvarez in game one, setting the tone for the rest of the series.
The stage was set for the Yankees vs. Astros in the American League Championship Series (ALCS), but the outcome was disappointing for Yankees’ fans. Instead of a back-and-forth series, with a win-or-go-home game seven like in 2017, The Yankees were on the receiving end of a disappointing four-game sweep.
Freshman sports management major Daniel Frankenberry was upset with the lack of competitiveness displayed by the Yankees.
 “We couldn’t hit with runners in scoring position. Our bullpen was hurt at the worst time possible, and Gerrit Cole gave up five runs. We got owned,” he said.
The Yankees were silenced by the Astros’ pitching by striking out 50 times throughout the series. Jeremy Pena won the ALCS MVP, which was well deserved due to his two home runs and four RBI performance during the series.
The long ball was prevalent in this seven-game National League Championship Series (NLCS) between the San Diego Padres and Philadelphia Phillies. These two wildcard teams had to take down the best of the best to get to this point, and the way they did that was by hitting a lot of home runs, with 16 home runs combined. The Phillies were able to get past San Diego in five games due to Bryce Harper’s two home runs and five RBI’s, Rhys Hoskins’ four home runs and seven RBI’s. Bryce Harper won the NLCS MVP for his efforts.
The Phillies and Astros will compete for the World Series title in a best-of-seven series starting on Friday, Oct. 28.

With the NHL just over a month into its season, there have been quite a few surprises, growing expectations for teams and potential new audiences growing in the league. 
One of the biggest standouts so far this season in the NHL is the Buffalo Sabres. Last season, the Sabres traded away their franchise player Jack Eichel to the Las Vegas Golden Knights after contract disputes and disagreements over his surgically repaired neck rehabilitation. 
After this trade, the Sabres turned their focus to a full-on youth movement. Highlighted by their young stars in Owen Power, Jack Quinn and Casey Mittelstadt, the Sabres are currently defying all expectations, as they currently sit seventh in the Eastern Division, just behind the powerhouse teams in the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers. 
In addition to the Buffalo Sabres, another team that has stood out after a month of play is the Philadelphia Flyers. Under new head coach John Tortorella, the Flyers have come out with new energy and have been playing at a high level versus tough competition. Right now, the Flyers are fourth in the very tough Metropolitan Division and have been getting great production from Defenseman Tony DeAngelo, as he has two goals and six assists in 12 games.
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell spoke about these early season surprises from the Sabres and Flyers. 
“I’m definitely surprised by the Sabres and Flyers so far. I thought that the Sabres had potential, but I did not think they would be this good this quickly,” Campbell said. “I expected the Flyers to be awful, but they’re playing well so far. I’m sure that they’ll fall off at some point.” 
Highlighting the two New York hockey teams, the Islanders and Rangers both are off to great starts this season. Right now, the Rangers are fifth in the Metropolitan Division with 15 points, and the Islanders second in the division with 18 points in only 14 games played. 
The Rangers and Islanders are being led by their elite starting goaltending. Reigning Vezina award winner Igor Shesterkin is currently 6-2 with 2.58 goals allowed per game average. On the other side, Ilya Sorokin is 6-3 with 2.20 goals allowed per game. 
In addition, these two teams have some of the most explosive offenses in the league. The Rangers currently have one of the NHL’s top three performers in the month of October with Artemi Panarin, while the Islanders are scoring the sixth most goals per game with 3.6.
Even though the Rangers have a top three star of the month, graduate speech pathology student Ryan Branigan wants his favorite team to add a mega-star into the mix. 
“A trade rumor that’s been popular has been for Patrick Kane. I don’t know if that is the best move given what it would take to get him, but that move would obviously be an exciting one,” said Branigan.
Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks has been rumored as a New York Rangers trade candidate as his time in Chicago is starting to become clouded with a youth movement and contract issues beginning to bubble. With or without Kane, Branigan went on to mention how important this season is for the fans and supporters of the Rangers. 
“The Rangers’ expectations are at least to make the Stanley Cup, if not win it. Anything less than another deep playoff run will be looked at as a disappointment,” Branigan implored. 
Brady Campbell, a fan of the Islanders, also has high expectations for his favorite team. 
“Obviously, there were some things that were out of their control last year, but they were also not good. Most of the core is still here, and I definitely think this team should be a playoff team,” Campbell explained. “They are built for the playoffs, so once they get there, I think they could make a run, but the first important thing is to get back to the dance.” 
Though the NHL season is just beginning, hockey fever is starting to sweep over New York once again, with Stanley Cup dreams in sight.

The 2022 Major League Baseball season has concluded. This immediately leads into the MLB offseason, which brings about all the free agent signings, trades and any other roster moves made by every major league club. 
The Yankees and Mets have both been at the forefront of much of the coverage surrounding offseason news. After breaking the American League home run record and being named AL MVP, Yankees superstar Aaron Judge became a free agent following his first six seasons in pinstripes. 
On Wednesday, Dec. 7, it was announced the Yankees and Aaron Judge agreed to a 9-year deal worth $360 million. 
This is the third largest contract in baseball history, only trailing extensions given to Mike Trout and Mookie Betts. It is also the largest deal ever for a free agent. 
Just one night prior, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Aaron Judge was headed to the San Francisco Giants, but immediately corrected himself after jumping the alert. 
After the announcement of Judge returning to the Bronx, it was confirmed Aaron Judge turned down a 10-year deal from the San Diego Padres worth $400 million. The Average annual value (AAV) from the two offers is the same at $40 million. However, Judge would have received an extra year had he accepted the Padres’ offer. 
Senior digital art & design major Anthony Hines confirms resigning Aaron Judge was the Yankees’ top need this off-season. 
“One of the Yankees’ top priorities, much like how it was of the utmost importance, was to re-sign Judge,” he said. “The face of your franchise and the AL MVP had to be back in the Bronx, especially after he hit 62 home runs and broke the American League home run record.”
Hines believes Judge should be named captain to secure his legacy as a career Yankee.
“I would expect the Yanks to give Judge the captaincy. They made the commitment, he’s a Yankee for life, now let’s give him that honor,” he said.
Hines is happy with the acquisitions the Yankees have made so far but would love a couple more pieces to be brought in. 
Besides Tommy Kahnle, the Yankees have brought back Anthony Rizzo and Judge. I wouldn’t be surprised if we land Carlos Rodon to pair him well with Gerrit Cole in our rotation,” he said. “I wanna say we’ll make a sneaky run at Dansby Swanson. I just have that feeling.”
On the other side of the Whitestone Bridge, the Mets have been making many acquisitions as the third offseason of Steve Cohen’s ownership continues to bring high hopes to fans. 
Despite two-time CY Award Winner Jacob Degrom leaving in free agency, signing a 5-year, $185 million contract with the Texas Rangers, the Mets quickly looked for other pitching options. 
The Mets locked up 17-year veteran and reigning AL CY Young Award winner Justin Verlander to a 2-year deal worth $86,666,666, with a vesting option worth $35 million in 2025, pending Verlander pitches 140 innings in 2024. 
This is similar to the 3-year, $130 million deal the Mets agreed to with Max Scherzer last offseason. Currently, the Mets have both Scherzer and Verlander for the next two years, each making $43,333,333. With Scherzer now 38 years old, and Verlander heading into his age 40 season, it is clear the Mets will try and get the final productive years out of the veteran starters. 
The Mets also signed Japanese phenom Kodai Senga to a 5-year, $75 million deal following his 11-year career in the Nippon Professional Baseball League. 
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell had high expectations for the Mets’ off-season. 
“My top priorities were retaining our guys, especially Edwin Diaz, Brandon Nimmo and DeGrom, while also looking for hitters and bullpen help,” he said. 
Following his incredible 2022 campaign, which featured 32 saves and a 1.31 ERA, the Mets brought back their closer Diaz to a 5-year, $102 million deal with a 6th-year club option. 
Campbell believes it was crucial for the Mets to make the signings to keep their pitching at a top-tier level. 
“It was huge to get Verlander and Senga. After DeGrom and Walker left, I wasn’t sure where we would pivot to, but Steve Cohen and Billy Eppler were able to go all out to win over some of the best pitchers on the market,” he said. “Verlander may be older, but he is still one of the premier pitchers in the game, and Senga has superstar potential. Those two moves were very important after losing DeGrom and Walker.”
The Mets also re-signed outfielder Brandon Nimmo to an 8-year, $162 million deal following his seven seasons in a Mets uniform. Campbell believes bringing back a home-grown talent was a great move. 
“Nimmo has always been an important player on this team. He may not be a superstar, but the type of way he plays is very unique. He is a very consistent and disciplined hitter, and he is always reliable in the outfield,” he said. “He’s always the hardest worker, and you can see how much he loves being a Met. He is a fan favorite, and I think he can play a crucial role in this team’s pursuit of a championship.”
Campbell has high hopes for the Mets’ future following their moves so far. 
“I am very happy with what has been done thus far. I still think they need another big bat or two and a few more bullpen arms, but overall I am pleased and very excited for the 2023 season and beyond,” he said.

This fall season the Student Health and Counseling Center is offering flu shots for all C.W. Post students 18 and over. The vaccinations have been available since October 1st and will continue for as long as supplies last. Students must fill out a release and proof of age to receive the 12 dollar shot.
“We’re charging what we pay. We don’t make any money,” explained Bill Milford, the Director of Student Health and Counseling. “Our objective is to make sure the students who want it can get it.”
The true flu season spans from November to February, but the Health Center is getting a jump on the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people with health risks get the flu vaccine in October. All healthy citizens are urged to get it in November.
The Health Center will conduct a traveling flu shot clinic in early November. The clinic will visit the Winnick Student Center and Hillwood Commons during Common Hour to give the injections.
Students who are squeamish around needles are in luck. There is a variation of the syringe that pushes the vaccination through the skin using carbon dioxide. “It’s not like a booster shot where it hurts afterwards” said Nurse Sylvia Barton. She went on to add, “You’re going to feel something or there’s something wrong with your neurological system.” According to the waiver, the side effects to the flu shot are “tenderness at the site of injection, fever, chills, headaches or muscular aches.”
The Center will begin Flu Prevention week on October 25th. Later this month, the Center will have a depression screening on October 7th, Alcohol Awareness Day on the 12th and Domestic Violence Prevention Day on the 19th.
Along with the flu shot, the Health Center provides the C.W. Post community with primary medical care, a gynecologist, free counseling sessions, nutritional guidance and much more. Also offered is blood testing for all sexually transmitted diseases. “If you’re sexually active, you should know where you stand,” Barton said.
The Student Health and Counseling Center is located in room 154 of the Life Science Building and is open from 8am to 8pm during the semester.

Letter to the readers,
Not only is the season changing, there ís a new air on campus.  It’s not that fresh cool breeze that slips through your window screens at night either.  Students are a little rambunctious and more energetic than usual this week.  You might have even seen some familiar faces- former students or faculty (cough, cough alumni.)  The athletic teams, especially the football team, have more adrenaline pumping through their veins because this is just any weekend for Post.  It’s Homecoming weekend!!
This is the one weekend that current and past Postonians take the most pride in. Essentially it’s the one time of the year when the entire school really comes together.  Students gather at the pep rally on Friday night.  The residence halls compete for the best and most creative skit, athletic teams are introduced for the seasons, a DJ provides the music and suddenly you are caught up with the crowd that’s singing some song you don’t even know.  But you sure as hell are having a fun time!  Then Saturday comes and everyone watches the football game on Hickox field.  There’s tailgating in the Pratt parking lot, families of students come from all over the states, alumni return to play in athletic games or just to come and enjoy the day with their alma mater!
If you’re a freshmen, than you have to experience this for yourself.  Trust us, this is not an event to miss at Post.  But before we get too carried away, lets introduce the sixth edition of our student newspaper.  Many interesting articles this week; one focuses on the increase of tuition, while one of our editors discusses the two primary candidates for New York governor.  In sports, both the boys and girls cross-country teams traveled to sunny Florida and came back with a few record-breaking times.
As for our arts and entertainment section of Loomings, we are still looking for anyone interested in writing book, movie or game reviews.  Please email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.comÖdonít forget, we are still looking for that 50th email to give away that $500 prize!
From your staff of the Pioneer, Happy Homecoming and good luck Pioneers!

1. It would be cool if you guys can take pictures ofr random students around campus. I know  I would feel good seeing myself in the paperhave a good feeling to see myself in a paper. It creates some sort of a celeb/student status – . kinda like  make an on campus gossip section. I don’t know, it’s just an idea. The 1st edition was great, like all the rest and near future printed papers. Real professional!
Peace

2. Hi Pioneer staff,
If I could change things I’d have articles based more on world news, not just issues that effect the average frat boy. Many students aren’t aware of activities on campus, so doing articles on those clubs might be a good idea at the beginning of the year. However, more detailed articles on our government and current events would be great. Also, while I feel like it’s important that the arts section be expanded and worked upon, the combination of Loomings and the paper is a poor choice. The magazine was beautiful and the picture quality suffers when artwork is printed on newsprint. There is also even less attention on the arts on campus now that there is no publication. It’s too bad that Loomings is understaffed.
Thanks.
Sincerely,
E. Amaral
3. Hello,
I would like to see recaps of professional sports teams in the newspaper. Something about the Jets, Giants, N baseball teams, basketball teams, etc. I think it would be a nice touch to the paper and would grab a bigger audience.
Ps: Tthis is Ppaul from broadcast 25 and I told you I would e-mail you!

5. To “The Pioneer”,
Hello. Recently I read the first the first issue of The Pioneer and saw the ad in the back about “what you’d like to see”; so here I go! I am a currently enrolled Art student at the C.W. Post campus. I would love to do a comic strip per issue of the newspaper on campus life, commuter life and general college life. I think readers would really enjoy “seeing” this in their campus paper. I plan on making it some-what humorous and personal to the school. Please let me know if this is a possibility and I will send some comic strip ideas. Also, if there is ever any need for illustrations or photographs I would love to get involved with that too. 
Thank you for your time!

6. Im just worried that maybe im so late to send this email 😀
I like the Pioneer a lot. It gives me a lot of opportunities.
To be honest, I know the Pioneer recently because I am an international students and also I did not pay attention to what is going on to the school hahahaha
however, i had a change to be interviewed during the chuseok story.
It was the first time to be in an article and i was so happy with my friends hahaha and we all laughed at my picture.
As an international student, it is easier to read the Pioneer because it is easy to relate to in comparison to the new york times.
In addition, if the Pioneer will add articles about the International students, a lot of them will pay attention! at least I hope so!

Coming off a tough overtime loss to first place St. Thomas Aquinas College by a score of 2-1, the Pioneers came out focused and determined for their next games at Molloy College (3-11) and Mercy College (6-6-2).
C.W. Post won in a 4-1 rout against the last-place Molloy Lions. Later on in the week, the Pioneers faced off against Mercy College (6-6-2), but lost in an exciting double overtime match-up.
“We played well both games,” said forward Rumen Kerekov. “We scored five goals in total in those games and we created many chances. Against Molloy we won convincingly, but we lost in a very unfortunate way to Mercy.”
Right from the start of the game against Molloy, the Pioneers came out energized and ready to play. The Pioneers scored two goals in the first half; one scored by freshman back Joakim Ohlson, and the other by junior midfielder David Carlsson. After these quick two goals, neither team would put up a point on the scoreboard until Molloy’s Dan Brown beat C.W. Post goalie Marco Jorgensen to make the score 2-1 in favor of Post.
Just five minutes after Molloy finally found their offense and came within one goal of tying the game, Carlsson scored his second goal of the game, and his fourth goal of the season. Post continued to pour it on when senior forward Emanuel Messina found the back of the net off a pass from Carlsson to put the game out of reach at a score of 4-1.
On Saturday, the Pioneers traveled to face Mercy College in an East Coast Conference showdown. Post took the early lead on a goal from sophomore forward Betim Bajrami, with the assist coming from Carlsson. Midway through the second half, Mercy would even up the score off a goal from Alex Cruz.
Both teams could not end the game in regulation, so overtime was needed. Neither team could find a way to win at the conclusion of the first overtime, so yet another extra period was needed. In the 104th minute, Cruz managed to give Mercy the lead on his second goal of the game, as this proved to be the final score of a thrilling battle with the Pioneers on the losing end.
“It was a tough loss, but we can still qualify for the playoffs if we beat Queens next Saturday,’ said Kerekov. “So we will definitely be pumped up for that game.”
The Pioneers next game will be at home against Nyack College (5-5) on Thursday at 2 p.m. Saturday, will be their last regular season game, which will be at home against Queens College at 2:30 p.m.

The C.W. Post Pioneers will not extend their season past this weekend. Post will not be involved in a PSAC Championship game. There will be no playoffs. And while the Pioneers outscored the Cheyney Wolves last week, the team may have proven why it won’t be in the postseason.
Cheyney is one of the worst teams in Division II. The team hasn’t had a winning season since 1979. Going back to 1995, the Wolves have a cumulative record of 8-161-1. Out of 151 Division II teams, the Wolves have the 134th offense. Any team should be able to stop their offense.
Go back to last week’s game. The Pioneers defeat the Wolves 63-28. Sure nine touchdowns on offense is a great stat but the defense gave up four. One of the problems with the Pioneers this year is the players’ demeanor on defense. There is no consistency from game to game. One week, the defense is all-world. The next, the squad surrenders points and puts the burden on the offense’s shoulders.
So many times this year, the Pioneers have given up easy yards. For the most part, they have been unable to stop their opponent’s rushing attack. This past week against one of the worst offenses in the nation, the Pioneers watched Cheyney run for 314 yards. Through 10 games, the Pioneers have given up 174 rushing yards per game.
Clearly that type of defense is not conducive of a playoff team. There have been so many instances this season where the defense should have or needed to come up big but fell short. As Coach Bryan Collins always points out to me, football has three phases. And while the offense has done well fighting through injuries, the special teams working through its own issues, the defense has not.
Regardless, there is room to grow for C.W. Post. The defense is full of young players. Donovan Edwards has started at cornerback as a true freshman. Sean Smith was having an excellent year before his knee injury and the vast majority of the starting defense will return next year.
But with one more game left against a solid slippery rock team, the Pioneers have an opportunity to reach seven wins and improve their record from last season. They’ll be in line to win as long as they can play a shutdown defense.

Have you ever considered where graduate students were living this semester? How about the number of graduate students actually dorming? Jennifer Fuoco, the director of residence life, has informed the Pioneer that there are currently 92 graduate students living on campus and that the total number of graduate students living on campus has changed over the years. Fuoco added that, “This number has changed from year to year and is currently up by six from last year at this time.”
Various factors can determine why most graduate students choose to live off-campus.  Sean Manning, a graduate student studying medical microbiology said that “since [he] lives near the school, he doesn’t see the point in living on campus.” Jessica Blumenthal, a graduate student studying social work, agreed with Manning. Blumenthal said that she doesn’t live on campus because she “lives 30 minutes from the school, so for me, it is not worth paying for housing on campus when I can live at home for free.” Although their reasons seem plausible, living on campus can also have its advantages.
Blumenthal went on to say,  “During my undergrad., I was in Maryland and paid for housing, both in dorms and in an apartment, so I already had the experience of living somewhere else.”
The director of residence life also provided a tentative explanation as to why graduate students choose to live on campus. Fuoco said, “living on campus seems to appeal most to graduate students who are enrolling in graduate coursework immediately after finishing their Bachelor’s degrees.  For students who have been out of the residence halls and away from campus life for a year or more, the idea of living in a residence hall, having a roommate, and sharing a community bathroom may no longer be something that works with their lifestyles or schedules.  Some graduate students are also completing their coursework while working full-time and may choose to live closer to their workplace.”
Though living off-campus may be suitable for someone seeking a different experience of being in another environment that is more private and confined, few graduate students agree that living on campus can be an advantage. A graduate student, who wished to remain anonymous, said that when “you live on campus, [you] meet a lot of people and don’t have to deal with all the traffic of commuting, and you get more involved with school related activities. And, living on campus also allows you to work.”
As you can see, there are many things that can influence a person’s choice in deciding whether to dorm or not.  One can agree that graduate students, although one may  think there are none on campus, do make up a significant percentage of the student population on campus. If you still unsure about whom the graduate students are, try networking through the residence halls; you bound to come across a graduate student more quickly than you would think.

Conversations Helping and Teaching Stu¬dents, C.H.A.T.S., a program created in 2009, is in the process of becoming an official club at LIU Post. In C.H.A.T.S., an American student and an international student are paired as partners so the two can learn about each other’s cultures and become friends. This gives the internationals students the opportunity to improve and practice their English. 
The offices of International Student Services and Religious Life created C.H.A.T.S. in 2009 and act as co-sponsors for the organization. This semester, C.H.A.T.S. has begun the process of becoming an official club by creating an executive board and attending three Student Government Association meetings. The new executive board consists of five students: Alize Margulis, Rika Tatsukawa, Arti Jain, Terry Chang and Serena Oditt, who will attend the Student Government Association meetings to represent C.H.A.T.S. Father Ted, who is in charge of the Newman Catholic Club, and Jeanette Murray, who works at International Students Services, advise the students. Three coordinators oversee the organization Murray, as well as Trica Figuero and Dr. Leslie Bai. 
“Make another friend; you always need a friend,” said Figuero. C.H.A.T.S. was created to try to build up the connection between international and Americans students. It also serves to improve international students’ command of the English language, allow international students to learn more about American culture, and permit American students to learn about different cultures. This may lead to inviting their partner home for Thanksgiving, and even visiting their partner’s country, said Bai. “International students feel intimidated and lonely. If they find someone who knows American life, they can meet through C.H.A.T.S. first and then become friends later on their own,” said Bai. 
All the C.H.A.T.S. partners are the same gender and are partners for one year. The partners usually meet once a week for about an hour. When, where, what you do and for how long you meet are entirely up to you and your partner. There are also monthly group events for everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. One of the first events this semester was International Friendship Night, which was held on September 20 in the Chapel. The event consisted of games, dancing, food and international trivia. The next event is a presentation on exploring New York on October 11 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. There is an Inter¬national Education Week Dinner planned for November 12 at 7 in the Tilles Center and a farewell party on December 6 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. “The events are open to everyone. We are always encouraging and welcoming visitors and new members, if interested,” said Bai. 
There is an application form which helps with the pairing process. Students fill out their major, hobbies and if they have a preference of what type partner they would like, said Bai. She said last fall there were 50 pairs, last spring there were 39 pairs, and there are currently 27 pairs. However, students join throughout the semester. Students, faculty and staff are all members of C.H.A.T.S. The staff members who are involved in C.H.A.T.S. are Trica Figuero, Dr. Leslie Bai, Jeanette Murray and Nadia Hernandez, who all work at International Students Services. 
“The biggest headache now is there are always more international students then American students,” said Bai. Many international students are waiting for a partner. Bai said new international students are their first priority but returning international students are also waiting. There is a lack of male American students. Many American students are needed and males are needed the most right now, said Figuero. “We have included staff members, and some domestic students take two partners,” said Figuero, to try to solve the problem of not having enough American members. “We try to recruit students at (club) fairs, but it is always hard to get them to commit,” said Bai. 
Bai said many show interest in C.H.A.T.S. while they are recruiting but then they say they are too busy. “Some people are afraid of the commitment; time is an issue,” said Figuero. The coordinators say the group meeting and weekly partner meetings are not mandatory. The events are held so that everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. can get together and do some sort of activity. As long as you are spending individual time with your partner, you do not have to attend the events. C.H.A.T.S. is extremely flexible. “It’s not something to be fearful of or stress out about; just try it” said Figuero. They said they want more American students to learn from this experience. “You don’t have to do something extra; you can bring your partner to something you go to already,” said Bai. 
Being a member of C.H.A.T.S., and acquiring knowledge about another culture, will enhance your resume and work experience as well, said Figuero. Clubs can also pick up partners. Every club on campus has to do a certain amount of hours of community service and earn points for it. If you are on another club on campus and need to earn community service points, you can earn them by joining C.H.A.T.S. If there are a few partners per club, they will give you about half of the points needed. “Internationalization, we want more students to open up, even make our campus a little different,” said Figuero. 
Rika Tatsukawa, a senior Public Relations major from Japan, has been a member of C.H.A.T.S. since September 2011. Tatsukawa was partners with Arti Jain, a junior English Education major, last year. The partners are continuing to work together through C.H.A.T.S. this year as well. “At first, I didn’t expect her to be such a good friend and now I can’t image campus life without her,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she meets, texts and messages her partner often. “I meet Arti at her house a lot, her mother makes Indian food which I love,” said Tatsukawa. She said she went to her C.H.A.T.S. partner’s house for Thanksgiving, her birthday and Christmas. She also said she has met most of her family. “Now I don’t think of her as a partner; I just think of her as one of my friends,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she and Arti have similar feelings to be kind to others and common sense. 
Taksukawa said that C.H.A.T.S. has made her more compassionate to others, especially foreigners. “If I go back to Japan and see foreigners, I want to take care of them and help them because now I know how they feel. Taksukawa thinks that American and inter¬national students can learn a lot from each other. “I wish American students can learn from International students. In the future, it can help them with their work if they know that culture,” said Taksukawa. She said she taught her partner how to say hello in Japanese, “Konnichiwa,” and thank you, “Arigato.” 
Alize Margulis, a junior International Studies major has been part of C.H.A.T.S. since she was a freshman. “I joined C.H.A.T.S. because I thought it was the best way to learn about other cultures and customs,” said Margulis. Her first C.H.A.T.S. partner was Winny Wang, a graduate student from China studying Science Research. She said she found similarities between Wang’s culture and her own. “Winny almost always boils water and drinks the water as such; whereas I would boil water but I would drink it only if I had diffused a tea bag,” said Marguilis.
Last year, Marguilis and her former partner, Kotona Uzumaki, a Business major from Japan, were C.H.A.T.S ambassadors. “We spoke at various C.H.A.T.S. events and were nominated and received certification for Outstanding C.H.A.T.S. Partners of the Year 2012,” said Marguilis. She said her past two partners have become her really close friends. “Kotona, who was studying abroad in the U.S. for one year was in two of my classes , and once we became C.H.A.T.S. partners, we went to various club events on campus and explored off campus too,” said Marguilis. She said she feels she taught her partner how to be comfortable in her home when inviting her over for holidays and dinner. Marguilis said her two past partners taught her many phrases in Chinese and Japanese. She said she and Uzumaki would see shows in the city and at the Tilles Center as well as spend time in her neighborhood. Marguilis still keeps in contact both of her C.H.A.T.S. partners through Skype and e-mail. “I’m hoping to travel to Asia one day, so I know I will be able to explore their countries with them too!” she said.
This year Marguilis is partnered with a student from China named Shuai Shuai, but she has not met her yet. She said she wishes more American students joined C.H.A.T.S. “LIU Post provides this opportunity through the C.H.A.T.S. program, but I feel not enough domestic students are committed or interested in becoming a partner. I understand many students have busy agendas, but how complicated is it to take one hour per week out of your time to meet with some one?” said Marguilis.
She said she has truly enjoyed her experience as a member of C.H.A.T.S. “Inter¬national friends have certain values that we as Americans don’t. I am not bashing Americans, but we should embrace other cultures and be open to learning about them, especially in this globalized business world that we live in today,” said Marguilis.

LIU Post was offered a special opportunity to display President Lincoln’s only surviving handwritten draft of the emancipation Proclamation in the Tilles Center of Performing Arts at the “First Step to Freedom: Abraham Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation” exhibit. The final version of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863, was destroyed in a fire in Chicago in 1871. The draft is the only remaining copy, which led to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom of slaves. The New York State Legislature purchased the draft in 1865 days after Lincoln passed away.
LIU Post is the only Long Island exhibitor of this rare document while it goes on a state-wide tour to mark the 150thanniversary of one of the nation’s greatest accomplishments. LIU Post and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts are pleased and honored to join with the New York State Education Department and SUNY College of Old Westbury in presenting these national treasures to the community,» said Dr. Paul Forestell. Along with Lincoln’s draft, a speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the centennial anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation is also on display next to the draft. 
Students who have seen the historical document expressed their admiration for it. “I think it’s great we we’re able to see a part of history in the Tilles Center,” says Mitch Mark, senior Psychology major. “It’s almost like reliving a part of history and it’s really special.” Matt Aronberg, an Information Studies graduate student says, “It’s amazing how a piece of paper was able to change so much of our history and to make our country the way it is now.”
At the opening ceremony held in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall during Common Hour, Dr. Forestell, Dr. Steinberg, Dr. John B. King, Jr., Andrew P. Jackson and Robert Tilles reminded visitors that freedom and equality hasn’t been reached yet. Robert Tilles explains to those in attendance the segregation on Long Island. “We have pockets of poverty. We drove along the road between the high and low performing [school] districts, and you see people across the street here look at people across the street there saying, ‘how come they get the best education and how come we get the worst education?’”
Both historical documents were on display for the public with free admission on October 15 and 16 from1 pm to 9 pm. The exhibit was offered in partnership with LIU Post, LIU Votes and the Tilles Center of Performing Arts.

The LIU Post football team ended its four-game losing streak by defeating the Millersville Marauders (2-6) on Homecoming by a final score of 20-15. Sophomore quarterback Tyler Heuer started in place of injured sophomore quarterback Steven Laurino, and helped lead the team to a much needed win in front of a packed house at Hickox Field on Saturday, October 20.
The Pioneers (3-4) had no trouble putting up points through the first 30 minutes of play as the team led 20-6 at the half. The highlight of the day took place early in the first quarter when Heuer jump-started the offense with an 82-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Kamron Palmer. Following an interception by senior defensive back D.J. Young, Heuer and the offense were put in great starting field position to do some damage at the Millersville 29 yard line. Senior running back Thomas Beverly capped off the drive with a one-yard touchdown run for his second rushing touchdown of the season.
The Pioneers finally got off to a solid start like Coach Bryan Collins has preached all season long. However, on the first play of Millersville’s ensuing drive, junior running back Ian Sadon busted out a 75-yard touchdown run make the score 13-6 in favor of the Pioneers early in the second quarter.
The Pioneers once again capitalized on Millersville turnovers. Junior outside linebacker Tommy Williams intercepted a pass and nearly ran it the distance for a touchdown. The offense of the Pioneers needed only one play to take a two score advantage as junior linebacker Rob Bright barreled his way into the end zone for a touchdown. With that score, the Pioneers had a comfortable 20-6 lead at the break.
In the second half, Heuer and the offense did not show up as the team did not even threaten to score once during the final 30 minutes. The Pioneers’ defense came up clutch on Homecoming as it forced four turnovers and limited the Marauders to only 15 points all game. Sophomore defensive lineman Joseph Thompson was a game-changer as he led the Pioneers with two sacks, while senior linebacker Anton Rukaj had a team-high 10 tackles.
With the defense playing so well, the offense had to hold onto the ball to avoid the Pioneers losing the fifth straight game. Late in the fourth quarter after throwing his second interception of the quarter and third of the game, Heuer was pulled in favor of Laurino. For the game, Heuer was 11-20 for 113 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions through the air. However, Heuer was efficient on the ground rushing the ball 19 times for 137 yards. With less than four minutes left to play, Laurino entered the game with a broken left hand and a broken right thumb ready to close out a Pioneers win. And he did just that. Despite not throwing the ball once, Laurino had three rushes for 11 yards, protected the ball, and moved the chains to seal a Pioneers win on Homecoming.
The Pioneers have the team’s final home game this week on Saturday, October 27, at 1 p.m. when they square off against the 3-4 East Stroudsburg Warriors.

	Hurricane Sandy and the nor’easter that followed caused LIU Post to close for a total of 11 days, including weekends. In order for students to complete their fall 2012 courses in full satisfaction with the New York State Education Department requirements, missed classes will have to be made up, according to Beth Carson, who works in Registrar. 
	New York State mandates a specific amount of contact (instruction) hours, explains Carson. For a three credit course, there must be 2,250 minutes of contact hours not including out of class work.
	The rest of the fall semester’s academic calendar has been revised as well. Make-up classes for the hurricane will be scheduled on Fridays, Saturdays and during common hour. It will be up to the professor to determine which days and times will be used. Wednesday, December 12, will be a mandatory make-up day for classes. 
	Classes that were cancelled due to the nor’easter will be made up as follows: evening classes cancelled Wednesday, November 7, will be made up on Saturday, December 15. Classes that were cancelled on Thursday, November 8 (2pm and later), will be made up on Thursday, December 13. Classes that were cancelled on Friday, November 9, will be made up on Friday, December 14. Faculty will be responsible to confirm all make-up sessions, times and locations with their students.  
	Final exams will now be held from Monday, December 17, until Friday, December 21. 
	The extra classes have been reported to add stress on some students. Jacob Maitland, junior business major, said, “I’ve had two rescheduled classes and one that really did me in.” Because of some scheduling issues, his parents are visiting him the week after Thanksgiving instead of during the break. His law class was rescheduled for a Saturday when his parents would be visiting. He said he reacted with “a lot of beeps, hash tags and stars.” The class is also expecting an exam that day. Maitland said that it was too personal to reveal his professor’s name; however, the professor allowed him to reschedule the exam for a later date so he could spend the extra time with his parents. 
	“Students should speak with faculty regarding any conflicts that they have with scheduled make-up classes,” Carson said. She added that if there are additional concerns made by the student that cannot be resolved by the faculty then they should speak with their chairperson or dean. 
Some students understand the need to make-up classes. “It was a whole entire week of classes, that’s a lot of days missed,” said Joe Nicastro, junior criminal justice major. He added that it’s better than extending the semester. 
	Natalie Post, freshman finance business major, said, “Mine didn’t bother me, but if I had a Friday class, I might be mad.” She normally works during common hour and did not mind missing one day of work but still referred to it as money coming out of her pocket. 
Softball players Kaci Hopkins and Nicole Hagenan, both criminal justice majors, were relieved that they did not have any rescheduled classes that interfered with practice. Their Earth Science class was rescheduled for common hour. “I’d rather have it at common hour because people have jobs and practices to go to,” Hopkins said.
Other universities fulfilled their missed days differently. St. Joseph’s College eliminated finals week to have more classes and Stony Brook University professors were just told to consolidate the course material and added no make-up days. 
“We can’t speak to how other colleges are choosing to fulfill their contact hour obligations. Additionally, not all Long Island colleges were closed for the same lengthy period that LIU Post was due to the consecutive storms,” said Carson.

In honor of Diabetes Awareness month, the Zeta Phi Beta sorority hosted a “Too Sweeeeet for Me” event on December 3. The event was created to raise awareness of diabetes and other health problems that might affect college students. It aimed to show students how to prevent getting and diabetes and the importance of staying healthy. This was their first event like this and around 15-20 people attended.
Ashley Noble, the sorority’s secretary and a senior Electronic Journalism major, started off by discussing her experience with diabetes. “I found out I had diabetes 10 years ago… I was back to school shopping with my mom when I fainted,” explained Noble after she presented a slideshow on the condition. “I’ve learned to deal with it. It’s easier now that I have an electronic insulin pump that I wear at all times.” 
Her presentation focused on acknowledging the four types of diabetes , which are: central diabetes that deals with damages to your pituitary gland, nephrogenic diabetes which deals with your kidneys, and dipsogenic diabetes that occurs from lack of fluids and gestational diabetes that affect women who are pregnant. The presentation also pointed out some of the symptoms students should look out for.
After going through the preconceived notions about diabetes written on a blue banner labeled “myth wall.” , one of the campus’ dietetic interns, Dana Fierstein, spoke. She explained that because Americans were not eating right or exercising regularly, more and more people are developing Type II diabetes. “8.3% of the American population has a form of diabetes but there are preventative measures you can take,” she said.  
She explained how blood sugar levels spike with too much food, illness, surgery, stress, or when necessary medicine is skipped. You can stay healthy, according to Fierstien, by eating breakfast, limiting late night snacks and alcohol, and increasing your fiber. 
“There are some crazy diets that completely cut out food groups, but they all work together to keep you healthy and your blood sugar stable,” added Fierstein.
Dietetic interns are the campus nutritionists located at the student health and counseling center and they are free to all students who have questions concerning health issues.
 “The event made me take a step back and be a little more careful about what I eat,” said Simone Medley a senior psychology major. “I’m not really a ‘sweet’ person but after the event I got my blood tested because I don’t really eat a lot during the school year. I am a lot more cautious now.”
            “I think the event was good but it could always be better,” said Noble. “I just wanted to speak about my experience with diabetes and keep people aware of… how to eat healthy in general.”

LIU Post’s Association for Campus Programming (ACP) had students hyped and anxious for Saturday’s homecoming with a week full of exciting events. Homecoming is a week dedicated to welcoming back alumni and also a time for current students to have fun, socialize, and partake in school pride. The week is very important to Post students for many reasons, and this year’s homecoming proved to be a success.
Jeremiah Aviles, sophomore Childhood Education major, said, “Homecoming is the core of LIU Post because it’s the anticipation of a crazy weekend.”
Main Events
Some of the main events were the pep rally, the homecoming carnival, the homecoming party, and the biggest event of the week was the homecoming football game.
The pep rally was held in the Pratt Center on Friday, Oct. 18. It was an enjoyable time for students to demonstrate Post pride and kick off the weekend. The pep rally consisted of performances by the Post dance team, cheerleaders, residence halls, and DJ S. Whit. The rally was also used to introduce LIU’s soccer, volleyball, swim, and football teams.
There was free food and Post giveaways for all guests. The Pratt was packed and the atmosphere was electric.
Alfred Cabera, sophomore Business Management major, believes that homecoming is the most popular school event throughout the year. “It’s the biggest social event of the year. Everyone participates in homecoming, even people from other schools,” said Cabera. “It’s a chance to meet your peers in a different environment.”
The Homecoming Carnival was a magnificent experience for students, families, and guests. The carnival was held in the Pratt and at Hickox Field at noon on Saturday and continued until 4 p.m.
Admission for the carnival was $15 and included a ticket to the football game and a barbeque lunch. There were rides, games, and club tables with promotions and activities.
Student Thoughts
Jesus Cardenas, senior Business and Film major, has always been excited and anxious for homecoming. “Homecoming has always been a time to take a step back from work and have fun with new and old friends,” he said.
“I’m excited about this year because Post is in a remodeling stage and we can make this the biggest homecoming and start new traditions with a new name,” he added.
The Homecoming Party is an annual celebration held on Saturday night for all LIU Post students and their guests to enjoy. The party has usually been held in the basement of Winnick, but this year it was moved to the Pratt Recreation Center to allow room for a greater audience.
Admission to the party was $5 for students and $10 for guests. Student Life, ACP, and a combination of student clubs and organizations hosted the party. The festivities were well attended and the venue was decorated with LIU Post colors and flashing lights.
Teresa Lisbet Ndong, sophomore International Business major, believes that this year’s homecoming was better than last year’s. “There were more fun activities this year, people seem friendlier, and everyone was having a great time together.”
Football Victory
The most important event of all is the homecoming football game. It’s the most anticipated event of the week, and the most popular. The LIU Post football team the Pioneers brought their “A-game” with them as they shutout Pace University in a 58-0 victory.
“I knew we were going to win, we were focused and ready to demolish Pace,” said Matthew Ferere, a sophomore defensive back for the Pioneers.
Homecoming 2013 was a great weekend for Post students to relax, have fun, and take a break from schoolwork just for a little bit. Most students enjoyed themselves and the Pioneer’s victory helped boost everybody’s energy.

Throughout his monthlong show on the streets of New York, the famous graffiti artist known as Banksy has turned the city into a giant game of treasure hunt this October.
Unveiling a new art piece on a daily basis, Banksy communicates with the public through social media and his website, banksyny. com. Posting only a picture of his recent work, and the located area, he leaves it up to New Yorkers to find the exact location—and they do.
People are getting swept up in the hype that is Banksy, and rush to see his art work before it is defaced. The mysterious artist, who remains unidentified to public, calls his monthly exhibit “Better Out Than In,” meaning that art is better on the streets where it is free rather than in a museum.
Banksy challenged authorites with his first piece. On October 1, he painted a kid standing on another kid’s back, reaching for a spray can inside a sign reading: “Graffiti is illegal.”
LIU Post students are captivated by Banksy and his mischievous work. Broadcasting students Rob Hairston and Karoline Onsrud defines graffiti as a visual way of seeing people’s thoughts, thus being art and a way of expression. “Graffiti is more accepted these days,” said Onsrud. “It started as vandalism, but it has developed into an impressive art form which is much more accepted these days. Banksy sends political messages that concerns all of us look at how his work makes all these people flock together!” she added. The British street artist has gone from being a cultural icon in the graffiti community to the name on everyone’s lips.
He wins his audience over with political and social messages, as well as creativity. There is often a double meaning behind his work. However, regardless of Banksy’s increasing popularity, graffiti is still looked at as an illegal action. Or is it?
Banky’s work has forced a new debate about the definition of graffiti. What started out in the ‘70s, with young people tagging their names on buildings and such, has evolved into a form competition with each artist “out-doing” each other.
Banksy has become a living example of how graffiti has expanded its limits. CBS New York reports that his drawings are being protected by plexiglass, and in some cases even by security guards.
The whole meaning behind graffiti has transformed from something that used to be an illegal action into becoming a legal way to make big money.
While certain building owners jump with joy when finding Banksy’s valuable paintings on their property, the NYPD and Mayor Bloomberg are less than enthralled by the brazen acts of the artist, according to CNN. “Graffiti ruins people’s property and is a sign of decay and loss of control,” Bloomberg said.
Despite Banksy leaving his marks all over the city, the NYPD is having a hard time finding him. The search after the elusive artist is still ongoing by law enforcement.
Although not legalized by law, there’s no doubt that Banksy’s work has opened people’s eyes to see graffiti as something more than just vandalism.

With rumors of major changes coming to LIU Post within the next six months, the semester’s first Town Hall meeting, held by the Student Government Association (SGA), was a necessity, both to dispel and clarify all the speculations.
The Town Hall meeting on Wednesday, Nov. 13, was an open forum, which allowed Dr. Jackie Nealon, the university’s new chief of Staff; Dr. Abby Van Vlerah, the new dean of Students; and Alerie Tirsch, the director of Student Life, to answer questions from attending students about a wide range of topics, such as campus life and the rumored changes.
There have already been some big changes since the new President, Dr. Kimberly R. Cline, took charge of LIU on July 1, including the opening of a new student run clothing store and the restructuring of certain administrative areas of the school, including Admissions and Academic Advisement.
On the subject of rumors, Nealon quickly squashed the question that a Shake Shack was coming to the campus.
There has also been an overwhelming worry around campus that tuition would be raised, which could mean added financial strain for many students. However, Nealon stated that Cline has promised no more than a two percent increase in tuition until 2020, compared to the average of over six percent.
The Apple Store that is rumored to be opening in Hillwood is not going to be an Apple store. However, it will be a tech store that is licensed to sell Apple products, a rare affiliation that only a few academic institutions can claim to have, stated Nealon.
This tech store is also going to have a tech support bar, something students can take advantage of if they are having any kind
of computer problems. The Student Art Gallery is will be possibly used as a shared space, perhaps with another student run business similar to the clothing store. The Center for Student Information (CSI) is going to be used for another purpose, possibly another student run business, but no plans are set in stone as yet, which means no more printing in CSI, something that could raise concern among commuter students who use CSI for their printing needs.
“I often use the printing facility in CSI as a quick option as I am passing through Hillwood on my way to class. I hope that there will be an alternative printing facility that is convenient,” said Andreas Olsen, a graduate Political Science major and commuter student, who attended the Town Hall meeting.
With the Gaming Room already moved to the upstairs study lounge, there was worry among students that
the Recreational room, also located upstairs in Hillwood, would be made into something else, therefore diminishing the amount of study space in Hillwood. However, Nealon assured students that there are plans to revamp the Recreational room, making it a better facility for students.
“There is already limited space for commuters to study during common hour; allocating space for this seems essential for a commuter school, ” said Kristina Renberg, a senior Public Relations major and commuter student.
An interesting discussion of proposed student run businesses for Hillwood was also held. One hundred percent of the profits from these businesses, according to Nealon, will go straight back to the students, with 50 percent going to scholarships and 50 percent to the school’s capital fund, which will be spent on other improvements for students.
For the students who live on campus, a hot topic at the Town Hall meeting was the Winnick Dining Hall, and the major question was, “Will the food change and get any better?” Van Vlerah said, “Paul Carroll, the director of operations for Aramark FoodSservices, is willing to work with students to cater to their needs. We encourage students to take to resources like the SGA food committee to help communicate what it is they want.”
Brianna Pisano, a freshman and member of SGA, who attended the meeting stated, “Dr. Nealon often reassured the students of their worries by explaining that they want to expand access to study resources and entertainment all around campus rather than just in Hillwood.”
The Town Hall meeting, which was held in the Cinema during common hour, didn’t have a large attendance. However, for students it was an interesting and necessary meeting that began to bring clarification on a range of topics.

Over the past couple of semesters, more and more students have been attracted to Hicksville for off-campus housing, causing an everyday struggle for students to board the free shuttle, which has a 25 person occupancy limit, to school in the mornings. As a result, the Office of Campus Life and the Student Government Association have worked together to improve transportation—and more options are underway.
Students, faculty, and staff are taking advantage of the shuttle services, and the same hours seem to appeal to them all. “9.00 a.m. is by far the busiest time,” said Ian Jonson, a freshman undeclared major who lives in the Hicksville area. “I’ve been at the bus stop 20 minutes before the shuttle is supposed to leave, and you could tell straight away it wasn’t enough.”
The excessive demand for the crowded morning shuttle buses leaves students with two options: to go hard or to go home. “Lines have been non-exist[ent], and those getting a spot on the bus have usually been those with the sharpest elbows,” Jonson said. Instead of taking the risk, Jonson and his housemates have given up the extra hour of sleep, and are taking the 8 a.m. shuttle instead to make sure they don’t miss class.
Recently, the Office of Campus Life and SGA have studied the issue, and together worked on changes to the shuttles. “Along with the SGA, we constantly monitor the transportation needs of our students and make changes accordingly,” said Abagail Van Vlerah, Dean of Students.
“Van Vlerah and I actually rode [the shuttle] last week sometime in the afternoon, to get feedback from students,” Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, added.
The changes already in place have not increased the amount of rides to and from Hicksville; the latest round that used to leave campus at 9 p.m. has been taken away, and the shuttle is now going at 1 p.m. instead, breaking the previous almost six-hour break the shuttle used to have between 10:20 a.m. and 4 p.m.
“It is an expensive and year-round service, so we have tried to play around with the schedule before increasing any costs,” Berthel said. “SGA has allocated over $100,000 for the student shuttle service during the 2014-2015 academic year,” he added.
For those who dorm and don’t own a car, the off-campus shuttles to Hicksville and Pathmark in Greenvale have been the only free alternatives to leave the campus. “During weekdays, I try not to take the shuttle after its break in the afternoon because I know it will be completely full of commuters,” said Tine Markar Lolland, a junior Public Relations major. Lolland explained that the weekends are the only times she does not have any problems.
To facilitate leaving campus for on- campus students, the university will launch a new Zipcar program on Wednesday, Oct. 22, which will allow students to use an on-campus rental car all hours.
The Zipcar project is a global car- sharing network with operations at other college campuses throughout the U.S. Any student over 18, faculty over 21, or community member who has been a licensed driver for a minimum of one year (international licenses accepted) can apply. After registering online, and paying the annual membership fee ($25 for first year), students can reserve a car at any time of the day. Over the first month, students will be discounted for their first $35 driving dollars, according to William Achnitz, Campus Life Coordinator and Sustainability Coordinator. The rental will take place outside of Post Hall.
Jonson believes it is only fair to give the residents another option to leave campus; however, he wants to see some action taken on the free Hicksville shuttle, as well. “The shuttle is a service offered by the school, and you can’t offer services unless you can guarantee all those wishing to utilize it will be able to.”
Berthel stated that he understands where the frustration with the shuttle service comes from. “Students definitely have reasons to complain,” he said.
“The services are paid for by university and student funds, ultimately coming from student activity fees.”
SGA and Campus Life are considering further changes to the shuttle service that may affect the university wallet moving forward. “We are looking into a bigger bus,” Berthel said. “We are also thinking about moving the bus stop from the Chapel to the Humanities area where most departments are located; this way, students will get dropped off closer to the classrooms.”
However, Berthel warned students not to expect major changes any time soon. “Be patient. It is not going to happen overnight.”

LIU Post has announced that it will introduce two new schools to campus for the 2015- 2016 academic year: The School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering, and the Honors College. Jeffrey Kane, Vice President of Academic Affairs, believes this reorganization will increase enrollment, and be beneficial to the overall academic environment on campus.
The School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering will be an independent academic unit that will join the School of Business and the School of Professional Accountancy within the College of Management. Prior to the reorganization, the College of Management consisted of the following departments and schools: the School of Professional Accountancy; the Department of Social Work; the Department of Public Administration; the Department of Criminal Justice; the Department of Management; the Department of Finance; and the Department of Marketing.
However, the administration began to notice that certain academic units, such as the Department of Social Work, the Department of Criminal Justice and the Department of Administration, didn’t seem to fit within the College of Management, according to Kane. “These very disparate group of units couldn’t be called the School of Business because you can’t include Social Work as a part of the School of Business. You can’t call Criminal Justice a part of the School of Business. As a result, they created an umbrella term called the College of Management. However, the problem with that is that it created a lot of confusion on the outside,” Kane said. One of the reasons for the creation of the School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management was to expand on areas of growth and development such as computer science, according to Kane. “One of the main objectives [of the reorganization] is for students to realize that we do have Computer Science at this university. If you look at the Department of Labor statistics and look at the area of growth in the job market where our students can get really good and professional careers started and developed, there’s a heavy emphasis on computers. There is a tremendous growth area in the job market for this new school will initially be small, but he stated that his goal for the school is for it to grow, and ensure that students have careers ahead of them that “will serve them well and make them happy and productive people.”
“I’m fine with the idea as long as it doesn’t interfere with my graduation date,” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. However, according to Kane, the new school will have no impact on individual students because it will not change the already pre-existing courses or the majors offered on campus. “If you’re in accountancy, then you’re still in accountancy. If you’re in business, then you’re still in business. If you’re in social work then you’re still in social work. None of this has an effect on the program that you are enrolled in,” Kane added.
Project Management, a new program that will be offered in the fall in the new school, is a graduate level program now at the approval stage. A degree in Project Management will give students the skills to oversee all aspects of a project, including planning, budget, project control, strategic issues, value management, human resource issues, and legal issues.
The establishment of the Honors College will give LIU more prominence, attract more students, and promote the academic environment on campus that is devoted to students and their academic needs. “I believe that we have one of the finest honors programs in the country,” Kane explained. “When it’s called a program, it seems to have a lesser status than, let’s say, the honors colleges at other universities. It gives the appearance, although a misguided appearance, that the program here is of lesser significance. We want to promote that program and raise recognition of the role that it plays at the university.”
“I feel very positive about this because [it] is a direction that many universities across the country are taking,” said Joan Digby, a Professor of English and the Director of the Honors Department. “It makes us more competitive to be a college rather than a program. I think that it will even encourage students that are already going to Post to apply to be in the honors program, knowing that their diploma will read that they graduated from an Honors College.” Digby continued, “My primary goal is to expand the number of students in the Honors College because that will permit us to offer more courses and advanced electives every single semester. I’d like to try to get an additional 100 or 150 people by next fall so that there [can be] more course offerings.”
Starting in the fall, when Honor students graduate from Post, their diploma will state that they graduated from an Honors College, according to Digby. Honors program students will automatically be moved into the Honors College next fall. The Honors College will keep the same reporting schedule, and will not be structurally different; however, students will have more opportunities being a part of an Honors College rather than an honors program. Digby predicts that as the Honors College at Post develops in connection with LIU Brooklyn’s new Honors College that Post and Brooklyn will have more programming together.
“It might mean that our Pre-Pharmacy students might want to take some courses at the Honors [College] at the Brooklyn campus, or other students from Brooklyn might want to come do a semester to concentrate on Theatre or Music at Post, where we are very strong,” Digby said. “The benefit of all of this, that as a director of a college, I’ll be able to work more directly with the deans of the other colleges so that I will have more input in terms of getting faculty to teach an honors course, and getting faculty to advise research for honors students.”
“If we can be more successful in letting people know what we have, then hopefully we can attract students from different regions, [and] not just the local area,” Kane said. “A dream of ours at the moment would be to open up an honors dorm.”
This fall, the Honors office was moved from Humanities building to room 202 in the Winnick Mansion. Kane believes the change of location of Honors from Humanities to the Winnick Mansion displays great symbolism for what it represents to the university. “Just look at the new location. It’s on the top of the hill in [the] beautiful Winnick Mansion. It promotes the message of, ‘Hey we’re proud of this thing.’ It’s not one program among many. It’s the gleaming top.”
As of now, a dean has yet to be appointed for the School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering, and there is currently no deanship for the Honors College. Dr. Digby will remain the director.
“You can think of these changes as a statement of our aspirations. The real impact is telling people what we aspire towards and what we aim to do in order to move the campus forward. It’s more a picture of where we want the campus to be rather than an administrative shuffling like it might appear to be,” Kane said.

Now that summer is over and it is officially fall, it is time to put the shorts and flip-flops away. The change in weather means there is a change in the clothes we wear, the trends we see, and the drinks we find to be popular at Starbucks.
For those who try to stay fashion forward, it’s important to know what’s trendy this season. “Fall is the best time for fashion,” said Monica Peralta, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “It is just starting to cool down; you can layer, layer, and layer, without looking weather confused.”
“There are a lot of fun new trends this fall. Shift dresses, sock boots, pajama dressing, patchwork, and new Victorian pussy bows are the hottest trends right now,” said Stephanie Adelson Bray, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “This season we are seeing a lot of fringe, a lot of burgundy, and a lot of suede,” Peralta added.
“The color I’ve seen everywhere and a color that I really like is olive green,” said Jawaan Smith, a senior Arts Management major. “From pants to jackets, it’s a great color.” While there are new trends every season, some trends are timeless. Fringe, military style, layering, neutrals, velvet, and bohemian are just a few of the trends that will be carried over from years before, this fall, according to Bray.
Fashion for men tends to be overlooked, however, both Bray and Peralta made sure to include trends that men can totally rock this fall. “They should focus on layering,” Bray said. “3⁄4 zip sweaters, a button down under with a skinny scarf and a vest.”
“We are also seeing a lot of Monochrome happening,” Peralta added. “Which is super easy to pull off.”
Fall, to some, is also known as the season of pumpkin spice everything. Starbucks officially has their famous pumpkin spice latte back for the season. “I have yet to fall under the magical spell this pumpkin spice has put every girl in the world under,” Peralta said.
“Pumpkin spice kind of unofficially announces the beginning of the fall season,” Smith said. Bray agreed, but added, “Pumpkin spice isn’t bad, but I think there’s too much hype. A classic chai latte and caramel macchiato will do the job just fine,” she said.
To help those who don’t understand fashion trends, Bray and Peralta both gave some of their “must haves” for the season. The boyfriend jean, over the knee boots, plaid scarves, black booties, turtle neck sweaters, and duster coats are some of Peralta’s recommendations for women this season. Bucket bags, velvet booties, and fringe skirts are a few of Bray’s must haves this season.
For men, Peralta suggests: joggers, khaki denim, light denim, wool topcoats, chukka boots, bomber jackets, and brown leather sneakers. “Everyone must get their hands on a pair of beige Nike Air Max Thea Leather Sneakers and Adidas classic superstar sneakers,” said Bray. Smith suggests that everyone should own a pair of black jeans, colored pants (burgundy, navy, olive), and brown boots.
“Every season is a great season for fashion. You make it the way you want it to be,” Bray said. “There are limitless amount of options to wear in the fall. Personally, it’s my favorite time of the year to dress up.”

People might think that Greek life is all about the parties, cliques, and frat houses, because movies portray them that way. However, this isn’t the movies, this is LIU Post. At this university, there are no fraternity houses or cliques, but Greek life is a “community of students who are initiated into one of our recognized fraternities or sororities,” said Katherine Wieme, Director of Greek Life & Student Involvement, a position in Campus Life.
Wieme explained that it offers students opportunities to bond, strengthen leadership qualities, and network with alumni. There are 11 fraternities and sororities on campus: Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Delta Zeta, Phi Sigma Kappa, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and Chi Nu Alpha.
“We currently have over 250 students in fraternities and sororities,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life. “We are proud to now be home to some of the largest national organizations in the world and are excited to add Sigma Delta Tau to our community in the spring
[2016].”These organizations are not all the same; they have different recruitment processes, structures, and types of councils. The three types of councils are the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Association, or the Multicultural Council. Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Phi Epsilon, and Delta Zeta are Panhellenic sororities. Tau Kappa Epsilon, Phi Sigma Kappa, Theta Chi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon are fraternities a part of the Interfraternity Council. Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Tau, and Chi Nu Alpha, are the fraternities and sororities that belong to the Multicultural Council.
“Being in a cultural organization differs from other organizations because we’re very passionate about our organization’s history and the meaning behind the letters; we take pride in the roots of where we come from,” said Richard Batista, President of Phi Iota Alpha, and a senior adolescence education major in mathematics. Batista also explains that one thing you learn is that you should “never forget who you are and where you come from.”
Each fraternity and sorority has a philanthropy that they partner with. “In DZ [Delta Zeta], we raise money and awareness for our philanthropy Speech and Hearing, to try to make a difference in other people’s lives,” said Nicole Cunningham, President of DZ and graduate literacy education major. Their philanthropy focuses on those that are affected by speech and hearing challenges.
“Engaging in community service projects and raising funds and awareness for various philanthropic organizations are fundamental components of being an active member of a Greek organization,” said Alexa Regina, President of Alpha Phi Epsilon, and a senior social work major. She mentions that AEPHI “values service, which has allowed me to give back to the community with the help of my
sisters.”It can be hard to find your place in college. Now that doesn’t mean your clique or “it” group, but a group of people that help you find yourself and enjoy your college and life experience. Greek life can help “students to find their home in a fraternity or sorority,” Wieme said.
“Joining Greek life is so important because when you join your org, you are also joining a community,” said Giovanna Domingo, Financial VP of Alpha Xi Delta, and sophomore accounting major. “Over the last year I have seen such a positive change in Greek life. Even if you don’t know a person and you’re wearing letters, you always have something to talk about because there is that common thread.” She explained that more people have joined, which has shown such a positive growth.
These organizations have made an impact on many students and the campus itself. “Joining Greek life has without a doubt been one of the best decisions I’ve made in college. It’s gotten me way more involved than I ever was before on campus and it’s equipped me with invaluable leadership opportunities,” said Jawaan Smith, VP of Phi Sigma Kappa, a senior arts management major. “Also, knowing you have 20 plus guys who always have your back and are there for you through your highs and lows is a great feeling. It’s definitely a rewarding experience.”
“We are proud that our Greek Life students are also active in student organizations, residence halls, athletic teams, and student run businesses,” Wieme said.
“Being in Greek life means being involved, but still the most important job is for you to be a student. The hardest part about Greek Life is time management,” according to Michael Aquilano, Programing Director of Phi Sigma Kappa and sophomore psychology major.
“When you join Greek Life, you become a part of something that is very active and you need to learn or already have time management skills. Especially if you want to hold and E-board or chair position,” he said.
Wieme explained that the Office of Campus Life serves as the primary advisor to Greek life, including all the governing councils, organizations, and individual members and that they support the growth of these organizations. Campus Life “maintains a Greek life expansion policy for any organization who is interested in becoming recognized on campus,” she said.
“All of our organizations are national with chapters across the country,” Wieme said. “Post students who join a fraternity or sorority will have the opportunity to attend conventions, network with alumni, and meet fellow members from other institutions.”
Berthel added that Campus Life, and the university fully support the fraternities and sororities. “Providing opportunities for students to take part in Greek life is very important to us and we will continue to look
for ways to grow and strengthen our current organizations and add new organizations,” he said. If you think Greek life is for you: go out and meet the different organizations during Greek week or Greek events, which are held every semester and maybe you’ll find your new home.

How many “selfies” does it take to settle on the “perfect” picture? How many times have you posted a “fire” picture onto social media, but your peers didn’t reciprocate (like the photo), so you deleted it? Although the players remain the same, the games and the rules of which the players play by, have changed ten-fold.
Once upon a time, well, really before all of these social media sites, we would look at each other on the Starbucks line, and make our judgments from there. However, “We now look at the person’s Instagram first, make our first judgment, and then we take it from there,” said senior history major, Kathy Rice. “I can name 1,000 times where some guy would like [my posts] on Instagram, I guess showing interest in
me, but then in person, no social contact, none whatsoever,” she added.
When Rice told me this story, I literally, “loled,” but this really is no laughing matter.
Let’s me ask you again, why does it take 200 pictures to get that one perfect selfie?! To be honest, folks, I think I have that answer. The mini photo shoot we partake in when we want to post a picture on social media is caused by something I would like to call, “Social Perfection,” a.k.a delusion.
I believe that social media is driving our youth to the brink of insanity as it causes them to feel the need to to “qualify” within their respective social groups. For example, Marcella Anteri, a Suffolk County High School physics teacher, recalled a story about one of her students and social media.
“One of my juniors, who will remain nameless, came to me at the end of class,” said Anteri. “That class, she did none of her physics homework, and totally bombed my quiz. She came to me, and before she could say anything, tears began pouring from her face.”
Anteri later revealed that her student’s disarray stemmed from her fear that she was being judged off of her social media posts. According to Anteri, her student told her, “I accidentally liked my friend’s ex-boyfriend’s picture, and they’ve been ignoring me all week.”
We all know being in high school can come with its times of social hardship to say the least, but if you think about it, social media just adds to that fire we deal with in our adolescent years. In the age of social media and texting, misinterpretation and cyberbullying have run rampant. It has led Mike Kurtz, a junior education major, across the street at NYIT to stop texting all together.
“You really wouldn’t believe how many fights [with friends] I’ve gotten into because I didn’t answer a text within three minutes, or reply ‘lol’ instead of replying ‘lmfao,’” Kurtz said. “I remember one time where a girl I was dating told me a joke, at which I replied [over text], ‘lol.’ She later texted saying, ‘I haven’t liked your attitude all day and that last text proves you’re giving me one right now.’”
“I never texted her back after that, because I knew where it was going to go,” said Kurtz. “If I have something to say, or want to talk to you then I’m just going to call you. I’m bringing back the phone call!”
Social media to me is a synthetic form of human interaction; a form of interaction, which in most cases that does us more harm than good. Yes, social media links us beyond the classroom and to each corner of the Earth; however, Instagram, Twitter, even Facebook, and Snapchat, have become portfolios, or as I’d like to call them, “baseball cards” to track our latest social undertakings, misleadingly presenting them to our peers.
Posting a picture of your lavish vacations, the new car, your selfie, taken from an angle that probably led you to sprain your wrist and shoulder, and not to mention your “following to followers ratio.” Social Media allows us to portray ourselves in our “best” light, and that’s great! What if social media just further enhances the saying “perception is reality,” in a world where everyone’s perception of each other is derived of social media. It makes me wonder if we are losing our authenticity, and that’s kind of scary. Well, too scary to me at least.

To the Editors of the Pioneer:
On Wednesday, I posted a response to the excellent letter Editor Caroline Ryan published in the Pioneer. In my post, I expressed admiration for the clarity of her argument, and sadness that a student newspaper faces such deplorable conditions in trying to report campus news. This stance of complete message control on the part of the administration is antithetical to the concept of academic freedom and freedom of the press. It is demoralizing to the student journalists and heartbreaking for faculty members who work with them. It also makes our journalism program a hard sell to potential students who want the experience of working on a vital and relevant paper, not a University Public Relations mouthpiece, and discover that cannot happen here.
I am writing this letter as an addendum to my brief Facebook post (which seems to have disappeared) after learning that copies of this week’s Pioneer seem to have been removed from the campus before visitors to Homecoming and the Admissions Open House could grab them. This has happened before. It also happens at the Brooklyn Campus. It is shocking to see this go on in a campus community. I am appalled that our administration thinks this approach is somehow beneficial to our university, when in fact it does damage to all of us.

Two of the five deans of the schools and colleges on campus are interim, acting deans. One was appointed earlier this year and the other was appointed last week. Only one of the five deans has been in place for more than a year.
On Oct. 6, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane, sent a campus-wide email stating Dr. Albert Inserra, the former president of Dowling College, has been appointed dean of the college of education, information and technology. Inserra replaces Louisa Kramer-Vida, who was the acting dean of the college of education, information and technology.
Vida-Kramer is the chairperson of the department of special education as well as an assistant professor in the department. She was approached to take the position of acting dean in mid-June 2016, and began the position on Jul. 1. Kramer replaced Dr. Barbara Garii, the former dean of the college of education, information and technology, who became the vice president for academic affairs of St. Joseph’s College on Jul. 18.
As the Pioneer reported in its Oct. 5 issue, Jeffrey Belnap, the dean of LIU Global, has been appointed the acting dean of the college of liberal arts, succeeding chemistry Professor Nicholas Ramer, who was the acting dean of the college from June 2015 to August 2016. Ramer replaced former Dean Katherine Hill-Miller, who stepped down from the position in 2015 and returned to her position as a professor in the English department.
Art therapy professor, Christine Kerr, became the acting dean of the college of art, communications and design on Sept. 1, succeeding Noel Zahler, who left the University in August.
Stacey Gopack, who was the acting dean of the School of Health Professions last year, is the newly appointed permanent dean of that school.
Only Robert Valli, the dean of the College of Management, has been in his position since 2015.
Some students have expressed confusion and frustration about the coming and going of the deans. Senior economics major Marvin Johnson has had positive experiences with going to deans for help throughout his academic career. Johnson feels that with many of the deans stepping down and the administration constantly needing to find new replacements, many students may begin to feel lost. “Some students have a unique bond with certain deans and by them switching up and resigning, it just makes the students feel not wanted,” Johnson said. “It’s like a puppy with a new owner.”

What does it mean to be a woman? Where and when did the concept of womanhood come to life? The answers to these questions can be found on the stage in PTC’s production, “Age of Elizabeth.”
Follow modern Elizabeth and her mother’s story of betrayal and her journey through a timeline of mother-daughter relationships in past generations of her family, and the lessons that were passed down by each; discover how the trials women had faced in the past impact the future and define womanhood.
Written and directed by Logan DeWitt, the idea for “Age of Elizabeth” arose from a topic of discussion on nature vs. nurture within DeWitt’s household, where she is the only biological child of seven. DeWitt started to question learned behavior to search for the reasoning behind womanhood.
“I started writing it about a year ago,” DeWitt said. The script is still changing and transforming as the actors go through the workshop and rehearsal process.
The cast consists primarily of women: five Elizabeths, following the usually male tradition of passing down a name, and one man who plays every male character within the show.
DeWitt wanted to center the focus on the women of the play, as opposed to the men, an attempt to pass the Bechdel test. The test identifies the roles of female characters within a play or film based on three questions: whether they are named, interact with other female characters, and talk about anything other than a male character. In the entertainment industry today, many films fail that test. This pushed DeWitt to have a female-driven show.
“It’s really interesting being in this specific show,” said Cayla Michael, sophomore musical theatre major playing as modern Elizabeth. “There are a lot of things that she (Elizabeth) goes through that is personal to me and other people in my life.”
An overbearing and involved mother pressures Elizabeth, an issue that Michael sees reflected in some of her friends. “It gives me a sense of what they must have gone through,” she said.
With all of the focus on content and meaning throughout the play, the set itself is made to be simplistic in a fair contrast. Containing a single chair, three hanging frames to serve as time dividers, and walls on the sides covered in photos, the set establishes a place in time without drawing too much attention from the messages of the story.
What DeWitt wants is for the audience to examine the relationships they have in their own lives and what messages they are sending to one another through their interactions, especially for women. “Are we building one another up,” DeWitt asked, “Or are we subliminally tearing one another down?”
“Age of Elizabeth” will be showing at the Rifle Range Theater on Oct. 28-29 at 8 p.m. and Oct. 30 at 3 p.m.

On Wednesday, Nov. 9 professors and students joined together to express their feelings about the presidential election by holding a sit-in during common hour in Hillwood Commons.
“The idea behind the sit in was to come together and find positivity and togetherness on a day that wasn’t so happy for most of us,” said Alexandra Mitchell, a senior musical theatre major. She didn’t want to call the event an anti-Trump campaign.
“It was a Pro-people sit-in where we wanted the students of Post to know that no matter who you are, what you identify as, and where you come from, you are important and your voice matters here.”
Taylor Bass, another senior musical theatre major, also partook in the sit-in. “It was a tough day. All of my classes were like funerals, both the students and teachers were in tears,” she recollected. “The majority of my peers are having their rights challenged by Trump’s presidency. It put my heart at ease to know that people were thinking the same thing as me and were just as scared as me.” Although the sit-in was peaceful, Public Safety and Dean of students Abagail Van Vlerah stopped by to make sure everything remained calm.
“I think the biggest part of this movement is that we do not emulate the behavior of our president-elect,” Bass explained.
“We will no longer tolerate those using his platform for violence. We will not be silenced by his presidency just because he isn’t fighting for us, we will fight for ourselves and for our rights as human beings in this country.”

After a five-year absence from the big screen, J.K. Rowling brings audiences back to the world of Harry Potter with her new movie, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.”
Taking place in 1926 New York instead of modern-day England, the film is a prequel to the Harry Potter series and contains Rowling’s first screenplay. While she is the author of the Harry Potter books, Steve Kloves and Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplays for the movies.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” was originally published as a book in 2001, Rowling used the name Newt Scamander, who is the main character of the movie because the book was published as the actual textbook used by Harry Potter in the novels. The movie is not based on the book like Harry Potter was, but is an original story crafted by Rowling.
This is the first of a five-film franchise planned by Rowling and Warner Bros. studios that will see the series stretch from 1926-1945 and will include pivotal characters such as Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” stars Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander; Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein; Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski; Alison Sudol as Queenie Goldstein and Colin Farrell as Graves. Ezra Miller and Jon Voight also play supporting roles.
Newt Scamander is a wizard who travels the world collecting different types of magical creatures and stops by New York on his way to Arizona. While in New York, his creatures are accidentally set loose and he must enlist the help of witches Tina and Queenie Goldstein, sisters who work at the Magical Congress of the United States (MACUSA), and non-wizard Jacob. Together they must return to find Newt’s creatures while avoiding the detection of Percival Graves, the Director of Magical Security at MACUSA.
A strength of the movie is the performances of the actors, particularly Eddie Redmayne and Dan Fogler. Redmayne easily takes the franchise reigns from Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe and anchors the Fantastic Beasts series behind his performance. He successfully portrays Newt’s insecurity around humans and is able to contrast that aspect of his personality with his more outgoing nature while spending time with his creatures.
Fogler is able to take what could have been a typical side character and elevate him to one of the core characters by the end of the movie. While Fogler’s performance originally starts out as comedic, he becomes more reserved and sympathetic as several emotional moments throughout the movie revolve around his character.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” also benefits from being written by J.K. Rowling instead of a screenwriter unfamiliar with the world she has created. Her imagination is so expansive that there is no shortage of interesting characters and creatures throughout the movie. Rowling even includes several references to the Harry Potter series and other material not in the books.
There are very few things holding this movie back from being perfect. While all of the main characters are fleshed out, some of the secondary characters are relegated to the sidelines, in particular, Jon Voight’s and Carmen Ejogo’s characters. The movie can also seem busy at some points with several plot threads occurring at once. While this should be expected from a first-time screenwriter, it is not a main issue as Rowling was able to successfully accomplish this while writing Harry Potter.
Since the last Harry Potter movie was released five years ago and the last novel nine years ago, it was possible that interest in Rowling’s work had dwindled and that “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” would underperform at the box office. However, backed by Redmayne’s leading man performance and Rowling’s unique storytelling, the movie has made its budget back at the box office and has successfully started a new franchise. The movie is now playing in theaters.

Nov. 14 was in many ways a Monday like no other. Still reeling from perhaps one of the most tumultuous, momentous and historic elections in the history of American politics, Post’s theatre majors began their weekly retreat back to the classroom.
However, most, if not all theatre majors attending the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building that day were shocked with inspiration when they saw what was waiting for them on the chalkboard in the west wing of the building.
An anonymous creator left a platform for theatre majors to put their dreams into writing, for all of campus to see. The creator has yet to claim responsibility for the mural.
“It’s a board where everyone can talk freely about anything,” said Sabrina Ali, a freshman theatre major, who also works as a receptionist in the department of theatre, dance & arts management. “It’s completely anonymous, it’s us being ourselves.”
With her hands folded, Ali gazed at the mural and said, “We want to be free, and this wall is our outlet.” According to Ali, the mural only began with the words ‘Before I Die, I want to…” and since then, this outlet has grown every day, consistently, by the hour, with each student and one dream at a time.
While Ali was speaking, three students passed by the mural and one contributed, writing what she wishes to accomplish before her time comes: “Make Mom and Dad Proud.”
The mural of motivation has no names, signatures, or any other form of identification. Regardless of whether it’s an image, quote, or simply just a word, this mural allows members of the student body to peacefully and properly display their thoughts, their emotions, and their perspective.
“We seem to learn a lot more about one another when we reveal ourselves to one another,” said Jacob Lackey, a freshman undeclared major. “I think the mural humanizes us, and in a digital world, we sometimes lose touch of that.”
With no plans to remove it, the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building mural currently remains untouched, located on the old chalkboard in the west wing of the building. Students who wish to view and/or contribute to the mural are welcome to do so as long as reverence is shown for classes that may be in attendance.

At 11:05 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 17, the office of Public Safety sent an announcement via email and text message notifying students and faculty that the library would be closed for two days. According to the notice, “the library will be closed effective immediately and will reopen Thursday, Oct. 19 at 12 noon. Efforts are being made to relocate the afternoon and evening classes that were scheduled in the library to other campus buildings. Class relocations will be posted at the library’s entrance. Updates will be emailed through LIU email.” The notification did not state the reason for the closing of the library.
In response to the Pioneer’s inquiries, Head of Public Safety Michael Fevola stated in an email that the library was closed because of wasp infestation. “LIU Post Facilities Staff and a contracted exterminator located a bee’s nest in the attic of the library and took immediate action to eradicate the nest and protect the health and safety of the public. The exterminator began professional treatment to remove the nest and treat the building. The treatment requires that the building is vacated for 48 hours.”
Faculty members with offices in the library were unexpectedly displaced due to the library’s unplanned closing. Classes were reassigned to rooms in different buildings. The Information Technology department was temporarily moved to the Browse store in Hillwood Commons. IT has “spread over what available space we have; they are utilizing the work room and the desk they already have for daily use. So far we’ve adjusted pretty nicely,” Albert Donor, a senior broadcasting major and Browse store associate, said.
Shaireen Rasheed, a professor of education, was the last professor to leave her office when she got word of the library’s wasp infestation. “I just took everything out of my office that I need for the next two days,” she said. “I’m trying to make a makeshift office wherever I can find wifi.” Rasheed has office hours set up for students to visit, she’s been holding meetings in Hillwood Commons. She had to post-pone a Skype meeting due to the lack of privacy available. Rasheed had just enough notice to remove her important belongings from the library so that her work has not been adversely affected by her removal from her office.
According to Fevola, rooms are reserved in Hillwood Commons for students to use as quiet study and computer space. Students who have questions regarding their classroom location may contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299- 2800.
Although the original notification informed students that the library would reopen at noon on Friday, Oct. 20, students did not receive a notice that the library had reopened until 2:13 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 20. The notice sent by Public Safety via the LIU Alert email system, stated that the library had reopened, thanked the community for its patience, and informed students and faculty that the library had resumed normal operating hours.
During this three and a half day library closure, students had to find other places to study, have internet access, and print out work. They were unable to take out books or use the library’s reference services, other than by email. Dean of Students Michael Berthel informed students by email that the library maintained virtual reference services to answer reference, catalog, and database questions via post-ref@liu.edu.
“The library faculty did a great job maintaining the online chat reference and email reference services,” Thomas Walker, associate dean of the college of education, information, and technology, and director of the Palmer school of library and information science, said. 


Students received no further notifications regarding the measures taken to remove the bees.

“Additional precautionary measures were put in place to ensure the continued safety of the community,” Berthel said.

On Friday, Oct. 13, the day before Homecoming, students were surprised to find 25 new yellow bicycles spread out across the campus, with multiple bikes chained to bike racks in front of Post Hall, Brookville Hall, the library, and between Nassau and Suffolk Halls.
Students received an email from President Kimberly Cline later that day, explaining that the new bikes had many uses, “whether it is rushing to your next class or squeezing in a quick workout.”
Students were expected to follow an “honor code,” according to the president’s email. Students were given the code “1954,” to unlock bike chains and to use the bikes at their own pleasure on campus, free of charge. Unfortunately, within days of their introduction to the campus, bikes were missing or damaged. Some bikes were hidden around campus, or taken into buildings and rooms to keep other students from being able to ride them. Another instance that occurred included the use of a personal lock to chain the campus bike.
Scott Carlin, the director of Center for Sustainability, is delighted that the administration offered on-campus bicycles to students.
Several years ago, students in the department of Earth and environmental science explored several alternative bicycle options for the campus. “Student research included working with third-party companies that manage and maintain the bicycles, [create] bicycle paths on the campus, and working to make sure that bicycles, pedestrians, and cars can share the campus safely,” Carlin said.
Carlin went on to say that it is not unusual for new bike programs to experience growing pains, and posed the same questions many students are asking. Should students be able to borrow bicycles anonymously or should they need an ID to borrow them? What happens with at tires and other maintenance issues? Who will be responsible?
Campus Life did not comment on the misconduct with bikes on campus. “We are excited to hear the initial feedback about the bike program. Students have been riding bikes around campus and we are happy that the program has been such a success,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said in an email. His email goes on to state, “As with any new program, we are constantly evaluating to determine future improvements and enhancements.
Students who have feedback regarding the program are encouraged to contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299-2800.”

At 6:57 a.m. on a rainy Monday morning, Oct. 30, an announcement was sent via email and text message to students and faculty notifying them that all Monday classes would be cancelled. According to the notice, “due to a power outage, all classes at LIU Post are cancelled for today, Monday, October 30. Faculty and administrative offices are closed. For Tilles Center call 516-299- 3100. Library closed.” Many parts of Long Island had lost power due to the heavy rains and winds throughout the night on Sunday.
The university sent a second email, an hour later, to inform students what services would be open on campus. “Public Safety, Facilities, Dining, and Campus Life staff are fully prepared to service the campus throughout the outage,” the email said. The shuttle bus service to Hicksville was operating on a regular schedule. However, the only available dining option for students was Winnick Student Center, which operated on an extended schedule from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Campus Life staff held activities to keep students occupied during the day, including bingo and Monday night football in the Winnick Student Center Gold Coast room. Members of the campus life staff and resident assistants were available in the residence hall lobbies throughout the day.
Michael Berthel, dean of students, confirmed the buildings affected by the power outage. “On Oct. 30, several buildings on the LIU Post campus were affected by a power outage due to an off-campus issue. As a result of the outage, most academic buildings, the Pratt Recreation Center, Library, and Hillwood Commons were operating on emergency power,” he wrote in an email responding to the Pioneer’s inquiries. “LIU Post Facilities coordinated with PSEG to address the issue and return power to the campus. Without being able to open essential buildings, the decision was made to cancel classes for the day,” he said.
Sam Scarito, a freshman early childhood education major, lives on campus. “The power outage was pretty inconvenient for me. Post Hall was out for the majority of the night, and people were in the hallways doing their homework.
I wasn’t able to set an alarm and I honestly wondered if I’d wakeup for class or not,” she said. Notification of the school closure was sent via text message and email at 6:57 a.m., when many commuter students and professors were already on their way to their 8 a.m. classes. Jamie Leigh, a senior forensic science major, was driving to her 8 a.m. class when she got the notification. “I usually do not check my phone while I am driving but I had my phone propped on my dashboard while using a navigation app. I feel like this happens all the time. The school should know a significant amount of students commute to school and should have taken into consideration how far some students commute. One hour before the first set of classes is not enough time to notify students,” Leigh said. Freshman accounting major Amanda Norton was an hour into her commute to school. “I think they should’ve sent that message earlier. It’s dumb to wait until 7 a.m. when there [are] commuters with early classes who are already on the road. I wasted my time and gas,” she said.
Michael Semler, a junior international business major also leaves early in the morning to get to classes on time but feels that this power outage could have been prevented. “[The university] should make sure that anything at risk, like equipment servers, [are] secured and contingencies should be in place when equipment fails,” he said.
The Pioneer has previously reported on hurricane preparedness. In “Storm Preparedness In the Wake of Hurricane Nate,” By Jada Butler in the Oct. 10 issue, the Pioneer reported that many buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the event of a power outage. “Several buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the case of a power outage, those being Pell, Hoxie, Roth and Kahn Halls, Humanities, the Winnick and McGrath Houses, Hillwood Commons, the Pratt Recreation Center, the Little Theater and Theater & Film building, the Tilles Center, the library, and all in-use residence halls,” according to the Oct. 10 article. “All other buildings, including the Chapel, the music and sculpture buildings, the Fine Arts Center, and Lorber Hall are equipped with backup emergency lighting.”
According to Berthel, the outage was not caused by an on-campus issue. PSEG, the electric provider for Long Island, was responsible for repairing the power lines to restore power to campus. Power was restored at approximately 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 30. Classes resumed on Tuesday, Oct. 31 on a regular Tuesday schedule. Students have not received any notification about whether the Monday classes will be made up.

Despite the chaos in the world and reports of prejudice in the news, many minorities in the United States – blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and others – are excelling academically in college and thriving in life generally. Too often, we forget the contributions they make in our communities, socially and culturally. It is disappointing to see the rage that they experience when still being labeled as the minorities in our multicultural society. Students often feel stigmatized when labels are placed on them, often because of their socio-economic status. Many overcome the labels, however, soar through this issue and lead by example. Blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities in our communities should not feel like outcasts, because all lives matter.
Pablo Correa, the 2016 salutatorian of Hempstead High School, is a sophomore at Dartmouth College. Although he is undecided about his major, he is leaning towards anthropology, with global health and chemistry minors. He is also on the pre-med track. Before entering college, he was actively involved in his high school, serving as Vice President of the Hempstead High School class, Vice President of Club Truth, President and Refounder of Future Doctors of America, and more. Correa, who was born in Colombia, came to the United States when he was four years old. As high school came to an end, he became determined to face the next chapter of his academic career with determination and excellence. Yet, he felt like an outcast during the college application process. “I can’t say for sure that I have experienced racial profiling, but I have felt like an outsider in many different situations, most of them here at Dartmouth or when I was visiting other schools like Princeton or Cornell,” he said.
Correa has encountered moments when he felt uncomfortable sitting in class in college because he was the only racial/ethnic minority in the room. Yet, he has not allowed this to deter him from academic success. Correa continues to go to events on campus and he makes it apparent that he is a low-income, first generation college student. Correa became actively involved in Dartmouth’s First Year Student Enrichment Program. This program enables first-generation students to become used to the college environment. With the help of the director of the program, he became acquainted with the resources Dartmouth has to offer, which helped him in his transition into the new environment. Correa’s mother reminds him to ignore the connotations placed on him because of his race. He continues to give back to Hempstead High School students by returning to discuss Dartmouth and the college application process.
“While in college, it’s very important to focus on yourself and not where everyone else is at,” Correa said. “I know that’s a very difficult thing to do, but it is also important. The only person you should compare yourself to is your older self.”
Karen Lopez, the 2014 Valedictorian from Hempstead High School, is a senior at Columbia University, majoring in economics. She was born in El Salvador and came to the United States when she was eight years old. She is now happily living in the city. The transition from Salvador to the United States was difficult for her because English wasn’t her first language. As time passed, Lopez practiced English with the help of her third grade teacher. Fast forward to senior year, Lopez realized how challenging the college application was for her. She focused on Ivy League schools because of the need-based financial assistance. The competitiveness of applying to these schools drove her hunger to become intellectually challenged.
“Focusing on Ivy Leagues and coming from a school like Hempstead High School was hard in itself because I found people doubting me. I didn’t have too many people to look up to. I couldn’t speak to my parents about the stress of the process and I couldn’t look at anyone else in my family because I was the first one to consider going to college. This truly tested my perseverance as I questioned myself many times if I was good enough to go to a top college,” she said.
Lopez felt intimidated at first when she visited colleges and it was difficult for her to find her voice in a new environment. She saw that there weren’t many students with her racial background at the top Ivy League schools. This has driven her to work even harder in her school work to show that she can make it in life, regardless of where she comes from. Although it took her a year to embrace her culture at Columbia University, this was the time she needed. She decided to join Latinxs, a student organization on campus. This transformed her whole college experience.
“I realized that while I did like being exposed to different people, I also needed the space to spend time with people who looked like me and who were facing similar struggles. Through this organization, I met some of my closest friends and started to learn a lot from them about Latinidad and what it meant to be trailblazers in our communities,” she said.
Dondre Lemon, a junior journalism major at LIU Post who is black, was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts and moved to the Bronx when he was six months old. The transition from the city to Long Island was difficult for him when he arrived at Post.
“When I first arrived on campus, I did feel different from the other students because the majority of the students were from Long Island and I was a city kid that didn’t know certain topics students would talk about,” he said. Although this took a toll on him when he started at Post, his passion for unity of cultures drove him to become more interested in reporting and journalism. Lemon has demonstrated to professors and others that it depends on the individual, not the color of their skin. People would not have guessed that Lemon was a reporter in the Bronx while he was in high school. He demonstrated excellence by receiving an award for his reporting skills and by publishing two articles with the nor news. Lemon is a staff writer now for the LIU Post school newspaper and the creator of the new PTV- Pioneer news show. He is thankful for the support system that has helped him with his transition to the college environment.
“Almost every professor helped me in some way. A lot of them definitely made the transition easier for me and warmed me up to the campus. I definitely know my success coach helped a lot, making me feel comfortable, if I had any problems; I know I can go to her for anything. Having friends has also helped me, and what makes it better for me is that I am meeting new people of different cultures, which I feel everyone should have in their circle of friends,” he said.
Next year, Lemon will take an editorial position on the student newspaper. He continues to be an inspiration for students coming from low socio-economic backgrounds who may lack confidence in their abilities.
Lemon believes that the negative stereotyping and labeling needs to change. “The first thing I do is tell my friends of color not to classify any group. Don’t say all whites this, or Muslims that. Right now, we need to be together and be united, no matter the color of your skin,” he said.
As a reporter, Lemon wants to show others that they do not have to have a high socio-economic background or grow up in a wealthy community to make it in any career they desire. “If I can inspire one person that they can make it just the way they are, I will definitely feel like I have made a difference in the world,” he said.
Amoy Brown, 2016 graduate of Hempstead High School, is now a sophomore at the University of Albany, with
an English major and journalism minor. She was born in Jamaica and moved to America when she was five years old. Brown has also felt like an outcast in a college that’s predominately white. Growing up in Hempstead, people had expectations of how she is supposed to behave. However, she proves them wrong.
“My skin color is something that I have definitely became more conscious of,” she said. Also with the world today, it’s kind of hard to do anything without thinking about the barriers that race does cause.”
In Brown’s college environment, she has noticed instances in which she was the only black person in her class, but she didn’t let this hold her back. “Just because I’m more conscious of it now doesn’t mean it makes me any less confident in who I am or what I do,” she said
With this confidence, Brown has taken advantage of what the university offers. She noticed how UAlbany celebrates cultures. She found various organizations that help empower people of color like herself. She joined an organization called the Black Theater Production, which promotes the performing arts for people of color. In addition, Brown was awarded a journalism internship with the student affairs media team. She also joined an organization called “Her Campus,” an online magazine where she can express herself.
Tibian Ahmed, a senior at Stony Brook University, was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Ahmed, who is Muslim,
has encountered many instances when she has been racially profiled and has felt like an outcast, especially during her years of schooling.
“As early as elementary school all the way through my now final semester at college. It’s happened at work, my internships, even in personal settings meeting some of my non Muslim friends’ parents,” she said.
At times, in social settings at school, Ahmed has felt tested because of the comments made about her. She noticed how students would take pictures of her and make fun of her while she was sitting in the dining hall. People would also taunt with her hijab. Ahmed was the only girl who wore the hijab at her first school, SUNY Brockport. “People would purposely work in groups of three so that they wouldn’t work with me,” she said.
Ahmed has had uncomfortable situations with professors as well. During her freshman year at SUNY Brockport, students were assigned a 10 page research paper and the professor gave the topics to the students. The professors gave her, ‘Should the U.S Iraq war have started?” She was the only student assigned this topic. She had no choice but to comply with the professor’s request. In order to make this assignment unbiased, Ahmed made sure she asked other students if they thought the war should have started. Towards the end of her presentation, the professor stated her own biased opinion.
Ahmed has encountered other moments when professors would make thoughtless statements about Islamic terrorism or extremism and try to convince her that her hijab is an inconvenience. Also, professors at both colleges she attended have asked her how the process was for her family coming to the United States as refugees. Ahmed felt as if they were committed to setting a low standard for her by assuming she wasn’t American. Ahmed had to overcome these situations on her own because her parents didn’t have the same experiences. Because her siblings are significantly younger, they too didn’t understand what she has gone through. Ahmed also realized the significance of the date September 10, 2001, the day before 9/11. This was the day she placed her hijab on for the very first time, when she was six years old.
Although she has faced criticism, Ahmed used this to elevate herself in school instead. She began interning at CNN. She interned with white men who were middle aged and she noticed how they had a different tone with her as she stepped in to contribute.
“I get it, because they didn’t experience people like me. This is a pattern; this is how they have been taught to think, and it’s a bigger issue. It’s unfortunate, you are at a point where you can think for yourself but they chose not to, people chose not to challenge themselves because it’s more convenient for them,” she said.
Before transferring to Stony Brook, Ahmed became a speaker for the diversity conference at her first school, SUNY Brockport. She spoke out to faculty members and students about her life growing up post 9/11 and her experiences. Ahmed also founded the MSA (Muslim Student Association), which tries to bring a Muslim friendly environment to students, holding events about Islam awareness and reaching out to non-Muslim students on campus about their experiences growing up on post 9/11.
“It’s either I was going to do something to make myself feel like I belong there or just let it get to me,” Ahmed said.
At Stony Brook, Ahmed has become an executive producer for Newsbreak En Espanol and also an EOP success coach to mentor students on time management, critical thinking and writing skills.
“Don’t keep yourself in a bubble – what scares you the most is the most important thing to challenge yourself with,” she said. “You need to be respectful and make sure you are not a part of the problem.”
These students, like so many of their peers, have overcome prejudice and stereotyping by working hard and demonstrating excellence. The issue has not gone away and needs to be further addressed in our communities today.
Until then, let’s continue to work hard and demonstrate that we are all the same. It’s time to stand up and remember we are all dreamers. Let’s make the labeling stop and make America great again in this way.

“Beginning in the 2019-20 academic year, LIU will compete in all sports at the NCAA Division I level, with a unified athletics program that will join our campuses into One LIU,” university president Kimberly Cline wrote in an email announcement to the LIU community on Wednesday, Oct. 3, halfway into the fall 2018 season, and two weeks after the academic add/ drop period deadline on Sept. 18.
“The unification of the Division I and Division II athletic teams into a more robust Division I program will have long term benefits for LIU and the Northeast Conference from an athletic, academic and community standpoint,” NEC commissioner Noreen Morris said during an LIU press conference at the New York Athletic Club on Oct. 3.
Along with seven Post sports teams being elevated from Division II to Division I, the LIU Post basketball (men’s and women’s), women’s bowling, women’s fencing, softball, women’s swimming, track & field (men’s and women’s), and women’s volleyball teams will move to the Brooklyn campus, where a multipurpose athletic facility will begin construction in 2019. New women’s ice hockey and water polo teams will be added in Brooklyn.
The LIU Post football team will move to the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), the lower of the two Division I levels. Football players are excited about the change, as they will not be losing their positions. LIU Brooklyn has no football team, and their stadium will be renovated to meet Division I regulations.
The announcement, which emphasized the unity of the individual athletics programs into “One LIU,” has rocked student athletes on the Post campus. For many of the Pioneers, this is not exciting news.
All Post sports teams play under the NCAA Division II, as they have since their inception. The sudden announcement of the transition to Division I in the middle of the current season has caused distress and uncertainty among many Post athletes about their future athletic and academic careers. Post students will have to re-tryout for positions on the new Division I rosters, competing with current LIU Brooklyn students and freshmen recruits for those same spots next year.
Sports that are combining include basketball (men’s and women’s), soccer (men’s and women’s), baseball, softball and women’s lacrosse. The men’s lacrosse and men’s cross country will move to the Northeast Conference.
Ashley Melendez, a senior childhood and early education major, was one of the unhappy students on the softball team. “We could not believe the news. We were all heartbroken that this selfish decision was made without even speaking to any of the athletes,” she said. “We were completely blindsided and devastated that this selfish act is going to break our family apart.”
An FAQ page posted on Oct. 3 on the new one.liu.edu, or athletics.liu.edu website addresses questions about the change. The question of Post athletes being able to continue their positions in the Division I teams has student athletes most concerned. According to the site, the athletics department “will personally work with each individual student-athlete to review all potential opportunities athletically and academically within the new athletic department.”
Newsday reported on Wednesday, Oct. 3 that, “LIU teams will draw athletes from both campuses,” but, “the 2019- 20 rosters will be decided at the discretion of each team.”
Many Post athletes, who qualified for Division II sports, fear they will not make the new teams. “There’s a chance that we might get cut. We don’t know anything; we don’t know
if we are going to keep our coach. We literally have nothing,” Jillian Lomanto, a junior education major and member of the lacrosse team, said. Without further information, Lomanto believes nothing about their team will remain the same.
The method and timing of the announcement were questioned by students and faculty. Many athletes feel underappreciated. “When the president announced it, she didn’t take the athletes’ feelings into consideration. She literally just said this is fine, she’s getting paid for this. It’s the athletes who are getting hurt right now,” Lomanto said.
The students are also concerned about their coaches. “It’ll be very hard if my coach is not the same coach [for women’s lacrosse]. If she’s [Coach Megan McNamara] not the coach, none of us are going to be playing,” Katelyn Politi, a sophomore elementary education and special education major, said.
International student-athletes were especially concerned. Those who were recruited internationally were either signed into a contract to play in Division II, or can only play in Division II based on their semi-professional athletic careers in their home countries before enrolling at LIU Post. Multiple Post teams, such as the women’s and men’s soccer teams, have rosters comprised of mainly international players.
The unified sports teams will have an even bigger impact on campus. The school’s colors will change from the Pioneers green and gold and the Blackbirds blue and black, to a unified blue and gold. The cost of replacing and redesigning the signs and facilities, including the upgrade of both campus athletic facilities, the Bethpage Credit Union Stadium and new uniforms, apparel and signage on both campuses, could be high.
The Bethpage Credit Union Stadium will receive a makeover, with upgraded grandstands to improve sight lines for fans, and to meet Division I standards. “This project will make Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium among the most modern facilities of its size on the East Coast and provide an ideal game day environment for our student-athletes and supporters,” according to a statement on the athletics.liu.edu site.
Roy Fergus, the director of facilities services for both campuses, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the timing, execution and price of these projects.
Unifying the university athletic departments under Division I could help increase the profile of the school, as LIU’s administration stated in the statement announcing the change, however it will come with sacrifices, according to multiple students and faculty members.
“What’s stunning about the LIU announcement is the consolidation of sports from two autonomous campuses, one Division I and one Division II, with different colors and mascots, and telling roughly half the 1,600 student-athletes that they’ll no longer have an athletics future at LIU,” Willie Hiatt, associate professor of history, said. “We’re forcing them to compete against each other for roster spots. I can’t imagine that a ‘Hunger Games’ scenario like that happens very often.”
Hiatt believes there was an unspoken reason for the merger. “The timing of the announcement also was a slap in the face to athletes. The slick ‘One LIU’ branding didn’t happen overnight,” he said. “Why didn’t the administration make this announcement at least last spring or summer to give students the chance to find another school? With another small freshman class of 550 students or so, was this to avoid worsening our enrollment crisis? And why do this after the add/drop period? If we care about our students, we should allow them a full tuition refund if they choose to leave LIU right now. That’s the least we can do. If I were a parent, I’d be asking for that for my child,” Hiatt said.
Lacrosse player Politi agrees with Hiatt on the timing. “I don’t think [the administration] did it in the right way,” she said. “Especially for people recruited over the summer. They didn’t tell them and [the recruited students] make decisions [on where to go to school] and they had no idea that they were going from a D.2 to a D.1 program, which is a huge difference.”
Students and faculty believe that the change had been planned for some time. “If they knew about [this change] for years, they should’ve told us the summer of 2018 so people had time to digest this new information, instead of telling teams during and right
before their seasons,” Veronica Saager, a junior special education major and member of the women’s soccer team, said.
“If I was a freshman, I might look into transferring,” Lomanto said.
Student athletes are still debating their next steps. Students have created several protests on social media, including a petition that now has over three thousand signatures and a not.my.liu.post Instagram page that has over 400 followers.

In “Smite,” we are introduced to Ullr: The Glorious One. In the game, Ullr is designed in heavy robes and a hood, he also wears a bow and arrow and his twin axes. As a hunter god that lives in the frigid north, this design could not be more fitting.

There are many gods in Norse mythology, but few are as highly regarded as Ullr, “The Hunter God of Glory.” In both mythology and in “Smite,” Ullr doesn’t represent the boastfulness or shameful satisfaction one gets from seeing others fall. He is honorable and pays respect to true glory in all its forms.
For Ullr, glory is in the silence of snow fall, the perfect curve of a bow firing an arrow, the honorable victory earned in single combat and the moment of life’s rebirth. In Norse mythology, “The Hunter God of Glory” is an enigma ever keeping to himself. In “Smite,” Ullr is secretive and knows that true glory lies in remote hideaways, untouched by the hands of time, and it is in these very hideaways the shrines to Ullr can be found.
Ullr is highly respected even among the gods, for it his him and not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the all father is away. While other gods would abuse the power the throne brings, Ullr knows that his rule is an extension of Odin’s will.
The mythology states that Ullr is a skilled archer and an expert in close combat; this is no different in “Smite.” In the game, Ullr’s attacks and abilities revolve around his skills as a hunter. His passive ability is called weapons master; this allows Ullr to switch between fighting with his bow and his axes, and it is here that we see Ullr’s true skills. With his bow, Ullr’s abilities allow him to attack multiple
enemies at once while his axe-based abilities are for single combat.
Ullr’s second ability is called expose weakness. This allows Ullr to land critical hits easily. Just as his mythology counterpart finds glory in a bow firing an arrow true, Smite’s Ullr is able to find the perfect shot without hesitation.
Ullr’s ultimate is called Wield Axes; with this Ullr gains additional physical strength and lifesteal which allows him to deal more damage to a single enemy. This ties in to his mythology as it tells how Ullr finds honor in single combat and pays respect to his fallen foe.
While not much is known about Ullr, “Smite” does a good job of paying respect to his mythology and gives us a character that is both accurate and fun to play with.

Overlord” was released in theaters on Nov. 9. The movie is set hours before D-Day (June 6, 1944) and follows the actions of five survivors as they ambush Nazi-occupied France for a crucial mission. With the apocalypse stirring, the surviving paratroopers face some rather unusual enemies. Actor Wyatt Russell plays a key role in the film, and has appeared in several movies, including “22 Jump Street” and “This is 40.” Compared to these, “Overlord” has a darker, gorier theme.

Russell plays Corporal Ford, a “hard-headed individual whose team is caught in a tricky predicament.” He spoke about his character and the challenges he faced in his role. “It was physically demanding,” he said.
“Maintaining high energy was hard for three and a half months,” Russell said. Along with the physical exhaustion, the cast worked with dangerous equipment. “None of the gun fire was CGI (computer-generated imagery),” he said. “That’s what made the movie fun.”
Russell worked with producer J.J.Abrams who is known for producing films including “Star Trek” and “Mission Impossible: Fallout.” “It was great, knowing that as you’re acting you are being graced by the hand of J.J. is very confidence-boosting,” he said. Most of a producer’s work appears after the bulk of filming is completed. “It’s always good news when a producer doesn’t come to set [often],” Russell said.
When the film opened, Rotten Tomatoes gave it an 81 percent positive reaction. Anthony Uly, senior international business major, saw the movie on its opening date. “If you ever wished that ‘Saving Private Ryan’ was a B-movie (low-budget movie) splatterfest, it [Overlord] totally is. I really enjoyed it,” Uly said. “The cinematography was pretty good, overall storyline was unexpectedly great, and I liked the female lead; she gave me a little Wonder Woman tease.”
Russell described the movie as a “popcorn movie,” something that people go to see in the theater. “I want it to be a movie [for the audience] to go with their friends and see something that people put a lot of effort into,” he said.
Many World War, apocalyptic films have appeared over the years, but “Overlord” takes to the imagery of the apocalypse even further through the use of pyrotechnics and lack of green screens. “The best World War II movie has already been made— ‘Saving Private Ryan’— that changed the way a generation saw that war,” Russell said. “You’re not reinventing the wheel; just [looking at] a different take.”

On Tuesday, Nov. 13, Amazon announced that it would move its new headquarters to New York City and Arlington, Virginia; the corporate giant also said that it would invest about $5 billion, and each location would see around 25,000 new job openings. Sounds good, right? Well, there is another side to this story.
Corporations usually decide to locate in areas with sturdy infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and reliable transportation, so they can operate effectively. Ac- cording to The New York Times, Amazon was given $2 billion in tax subsidies for its decision to build facilities in these locations. Why is it that one of the nation’s most prosperous companies was just given $2 billion?
The answer is simple: Amazon is just one example of an alliance between the business class and the political class. Amazon’s decision to move one of its new headquarters to New York City is no accident, as the city is run by Mayor Bill de Blasio, one of the most liberal mayors in the country. Big corporations often lobby before Congress and give contributions to the politicians; in turn, the politicians give favors to the corporations.
Unfortunately, the Right has defended large corporations for years. Corporate America, however, hates the idea of free markets and competition, which are conservative ideals: according to The Daily Beast, a left-leaning website, “That’s because they have the resources to hire the lawyers needed to navigate regulations, and the lobbyists who can help change the rules if necessary.” Companies like Amazon end up becoming monopolies, and competition from small business is crushed. There is nothing conservative about this practice, just as there is nothing conservative about most big corporations. It is just the opposite: they are the backbone of the Democratic Party.
If you were to check the donor lists of Democratic candidates like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, you would find that many large corporations often donate generously to Democrats. According to AlterNet, the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, gave over $300,000 to Hillary Clinton in the last election.
For all the yammering we hear from Democrats about the evils of corporate America, they certainly have no problem taking donations from large corporations for their political campaigns.
The Republican Party deserves some blame, too: in order to satisfy the business interests that fund their campaigns, establishment Republicans often are silent on the issue of illegal immigration and border security, as they want to provide cheap labor to their corporate donors. A mass influx of low-skilled labor often puts downward pressure on the wages of Americans. Many on the Left are right to say that corporate America deserves some skepticism; the problem is, they are enabling the very practices they claim to be fighting against.

The 2019-2020 women’s ice hockey team is the first in program history, and it is also the first Division I ice hockey program on Long Island. Head Coach Rob Morgan put together a team he believes will continue to make history. “I recruited every kid and everyone was recruited here for a reason, not just to fill a jersey, but to be a part of something special,” he said. 
The Sharks opened their season with an exhibition match against a professional women’s ice hockey team, the Metropolitan Riveters. The Sharks lost in a 10-3 battle, however they saw it as a great game to prepare them for the regular season. “Getting that first look at the kind of talent, speed, and strength we will be up against this season was an awesome learning experience,” junior captain Morgan Schauer said.
The Sharks officially kicked off regular season play with two games against University of Connecticut. While the Sharks lost in back-to-back days to the UCONN Huskies, the games showed the determination and potential they have in games to come.
In the first game against UCONN, freshman goalie Mia McLeod stood out, making 49 saves on 53 shots. A week later, McLeod made history as the first LIU ice hockey player to win conference recognition, as she was named “Rookie of the Week.” In the second game against UCONN, freshman forward, Carrigan Umpherville scored the first goal of the regular season for the Sharks. 
The early season schedule is made up of some extremely challenging games, including reigning NCAA Division I champions University of Wisconsin. The team played University of Wisconsin on Friday, Oct. 18 and Saturday, Oct. 19. Before the game, Coach Morgan said he expected a tough game, but that nothing is decided beforehand. “I know how good they are and our team knows how good they are. But the outcome is determined after 60 minutes. So, we are gonna go out there and play our hardest and give them a good game,” he said.
The Sharks fought hard but fell in both games with the scores of 2-10 and 0-12. However, the team is taking these games as learning experiences, according to freshman captain, Matilda af Bjur. “Playing against the best is an indescribable feeling. We have a way to go to get there, but it is a journey me and the team are ready to do,” she said.
Junior captain, Morgan Schauer, also had a positive outlook on the loses to the Wisconsin Badgers with the belief that these games are “going to make us stronger and help us to build up our program.”
In addition to play against high ranked teams, one of the biggest challenges the team has faced is the youth across the team. Twenty-one out of their 23 team members are freshmen. “It’s a pack of puppies running around,” Coach Morgan said. 
Without seniors on the team, Morgan said the team lacks the looming sense of a “last ride” among seniors. They don’t have the mindset that this is their last year to win. “Usually, it’s your seniors that will set the tone or raise the bar because it is their last year to try and win. But right now, they have four years to win,” Morgan said. 
Up next for the Sharks is two games against Coach Morgan’s former team, Yale University. The games are being played on Friday, Oct. 25 and Saturday, Oct. 26.

Sammy Bell, junior psychology major, is a forward on the field hockey team, as well as the team’s leading scorer. During her time playing as a Shark for the fall 2019 season, Bell scored nine goals and 20 points throughout the 14 games the team played. 
Bell hails from Scotland and started playing field hockey there when she was seven years old. After playing field hockey in high school, Bell decided to attend college in America and chose LIU after Head Coach Raenee Savin got in contact with her. “Coach Savin reached out to me and I had never been to America before so I was very excited,” she said.
Bell played the previous two seasons with the Post Pioneers. As a freshman in 2017, she co-lead the team in assists, and along with 11 goals, she finished third on the team’s scoring list with 35 points. In 2018, Bell was second in all three categories with 16 goals, seven assists, and 39 points. 
Bell had a slow start to this season, but between Sunday, Oct. 13 and Friday, Oct. 25, she scored six goals in four games, including an overtime goal against Sacred Heart University, her second that day. Bell said the reason for her recent success is due to her team. “They have been hyping me up and playing better to win and want me to do well,” she said. Bell has also taken 62 out of the team’s 155 shots this season. She thanks senior midfielder and team captain Taylor Brodsky for that statistics. “Taylor is the reason I have many shots, as she is able to set me up for good scoring opportunities,” she said.  
Brodsky predicts Bell will have a big impact in the upcoming games. “She’s a big part of our team and we rely on her a lot,” she said. Bell is a great player with a humble attitude, but she needs pushing from her captain, according to Brodsky. “She needs to be pushed a lot but she is a very humble player and it’s been an honor to play with such a good field hockey player, and especially to be the person that pushes her every day,” she said.     
Junior goalkeeper Rachel Vellis is one of Bell’s close friends and said that she loves to see her score. “She is my best friend and gets me really hyped up. It gets me excited when I hear the echo from the other side of the field,” Vellis said. She also said that Bell is a strong presence on the field and brings a lot of energy.  
Coach Savin has coached Bell for three years and said she has seen her develop from a freshman who wasn’t prepared for the amount of conditioning collegiate field hockey requires, to one of the team’s most valuable players. “The summer after her freshman year, she made a huge adjustment, which helped prepare her for the great season that she had last year,” Savin said. “Sammy has been a huge asset for our team and we need her to keep putting the ball in the back of the net because very often we come out on top when she’s scoring.”  
Going forward, Bell and the field hockey team play their last games of the regular season on Friday, Nov. 1, against Fairfield University and on Sunday, Nov. 3, against Temple University. The Sharks will then prepare for the NEC Tournament since the team secured a spot in the playoffs with a 1-0 win over Bryant University on Sunday Oct. 27. They are the first Shark team of the new Division I program to claim a playoff berth. The NEC championship tournament is being hosted in Staten Island at Wagner University on Friday, Nov. 8 and Sunday, Nov. 10.

With new colors and a newly combined team, the bowling team is back on the lanes with their goal set on winning the Northeast Conference trophy.
The team has a total of 13 bowlers, six from the Post campus, four from the Brook-lyn campus, and three newly recruited freshmen. Leading the team is Head Coach Kayla Jones, who previously coached the Blackbirds for seven seasons. She lead the Blackbirds to their first ever conference championship in 2016 and broke the program record for wins the following year with 75 won games. 
Coach Jones said she didn’t know what to expect when she first heard of the announcement of the merger of the Post and Brooklyn campuses and that there was a fear of the unknown. “Change is scary, and of course, this was a major change,” she said.
Despite the uncertainty, Coach Jones said her team handled the transition well, both on and off the lanes. “The girls get along very well off the lanes and I believe each day on the lanes we get better at communication, cohesion, and helping each other be the best we can for the team,” she said.  
Coach Jones also said the unification made the team stronger and generated depth. “It’s a comfortable feeling knowing we can change someone in and out,” she said. “Having a lot of talent is a good thing because each player brings something differ-ent to the table and that is what makes us a stronger team.”
The Sharks have an overall record of 21 wins and 12 losses, being 7-3 in conference. Coach Jones said the conference the team plays in is very tough, with six teams ranked among the top 25 in the nation. “It’s strong competition every weekend, every match,” she said. 
Junior bowler Emily Cavanaugh was a top competitor on the Pioneers’ bowling team the previous two seasons and she hopes to show that the new team can perform this season. 
“As a team we hope to prove people wrong; that we can overcome the obstacle of the merge and come together as a strong, winning NEC team,” she said.  
The team’s biggest event this season was the Northeast Conference meet in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Nov. 9 and Sunday, Nov. 10. The team left the meet with five wins and one loss, which earned them first place in the league. 
Senior bowler Tyler Karpinecz played for the Blackbirds last year and experienced her team falling short in the NEC Conference Championship, something she wants to prevent from happening again. She sees this year’s team’s recent success at the NEC meet as a positive indicator. 
“Going 5-1 and being placed first right after the first NEC meet is something that will only motivate us to keep that spot,” she said. “The Sharks are hungry this season and there’s nothing stopping us.” 
The Shark’s next competition is the UMES Hawk Classicon on Friday, Nov. 22 to Sunday, Nov. 24 in Millsboro, Delaware.

Update – On Wednesday, Oct. 14 an additional 20 cases were reported on the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, bringing the total number of reported cases since Oct. 10 to 33.
Editor’s Note – The Pioneer chose to keep quotes given to us by athletes anonymous out of respect for their privacy.
At least 14 students have tested positive for COVID-19 due to off campus gatherings attended by several members of various athletic teams, according to an email from Chief of Student Affairs and Alumni Engagement Michael Berthel on Sunday, Oct. 11. 
The affected students and individuals who they were in close contact with are required to quarantine for two weeks. Anyone who is in a class with a student who tested positive has been notified, according to the email. The email also states that the university will be disinfecting all impacted areas, but does not specify what areas on campus have been affected.
The university shared the email with students and staff when they became aware that off campus gatherings had occurred, according to Berthel.
“The University immediately coordinated its response with the Department of Health. We are working in close cooperation with the Department of Health on contact tracing in accordance with their Contact Tracing Program, and notifying all students and faculty who are in classes with these individuals,” Berthel said. “Anyone who had been in contact with these students would have been notified by this point.”
The incident comes soon after the NEC announced winter athletics we’re supposed to start on time on Nov. 25.
On Saturday, Oct. 10, 11 positive cases were reported on the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, bringing the total number of reported cases for the two week from Sept. 27 to Oct. 10 to 19. On Sunday, Oct. 11 a new two week period that will last until Friday, Oct. 23 began, with a total of 13 positive cases being reported thus far. It is unclear how many cases are directly related to the gatherings.
All athletics have been paused for one week, and several athletic teams are currently quarantining as precautionary measures, according to Berthel.
One student athlete of a team not involved in this incident was upset because their practices have been cancelled for at least a week. 
“Everyone has been working super hard to be able to practice again, and because of a party it’s all on hold again,” they said. “None of us even heard of a party or anything and then next thing you know it’s shut down.”
The university currently has 85 students in quarantine, and 39 out of the available 50 quarantine rooms are currently in use, according to the New York State COVID-19 Report Card website.
Some athletes are afraid to speak out about the situation, fearing possible negative consequences.
“Athletes are being quiet about this incident in fear of negative repercussions from the athletic department,” one athlete said. “Although their information could be the difference between life and death to students with underlying health conditions.”
Disciplinary action against the students who attended the gatherings is being considered, according to Berthel. No details about what consequences may occur are known at the moment.
Some students, such as senior psychology major Nicole Ludwig, feel that the university needs to do a better job with enforcing social distancing guidelines on campus.
“The school needs to do more than send text messages and emails to enforce social distancing guidelines,” Ludwig said. “I’ve seen so many students walking around with their masks either below their noses or completely off without any consequences, and have even seen giant groups of friends eating together.”
In his email to the community, Berthel urged the student body to follow the university’s social distancing guidelines. 
“I understand that this pandemic has required sacrifice and you yearn for the social and emotional connection that has become synonymous with your LIU experience. We want that for you too,” the email stated. “However, the stakes are too high and we cannot take chances. Remain vigilant, renew your commitment to keeping yourself and our community safe, and act in a manner that demonstrates a genuine concern for your peers, your faculty, and your loved ones.”
Berthel would like to see the university have no new cases, which is something that can only be possible if students follow the universities COVID-19 guidelines.
“LIU will continue to respond immediately to positive cases when or if they occur. The positive test rate on campus is below county and state levels, but the university goal is to have zero cases,” he said. “All members of the LIU community are reminded to adhere very closely to LIU’s health guidelines: wear a face covering at all times when in public spaces on campus; practice physical distancing, do not gather in large groups; complete the daily health check-in; wash your hands regularly; stay home when you’re sick and seek immediate medical attention if you’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.”
Senior psychology major Sarah Ren, feels that while the university has done a good job regarding their COVID-19 protocols, the university’s dashboard does not provide enough information to keep the campus community informed. 
Ren would like to see the dashboard include the total number of cases the campus has experienced since the beginning of the semester. She feels that only showing positive cases from a two week period makes the situation appear less serious then it might otherwise be if the total number of cases were shown, and that students would be less likely to break social distancing guidelines if they had all of the information. 
Senior broadcasting major, Matthew Valentino thinks that the behavior displayed by some students is unfair to commuting students who have to put their families at risk.
“Now the students who commute and have to come on campus, but also be around their parents, or possibly grandparents, are putting themselves at risk, and everyone else around them at risk as well,” he said. “All because these kids want to have their college experience.”
Ludwig understands that the students who attended the parties most likely wanted to have a normal college experience, but thinks that what they did was reckless and dangerous.
“I think it’s very selfish to be trying to go to a party right now. I know so many people feel robbed of their college experience, and I can empathize with that, but your college experience isn’t going to mean as much to you if you find out someone you love has died from COVID,” she said. “And the longer we refuse to follow guidelines, the longer it’ll take for things to return to normal. To not follow the rules is to openly admit that you do not care about the safety of yourself or other people, and I don’t have any respect for that.”

With the ongoing issue of Covid-19, everything from sports programs to theatre groups have had to make adjustments in order to ensure students’ safety. One such group is the Wind Ensemble, who have faced special challenges in resuming their rehearsals as students have returned to campus. 
The students and faculty of Wind Ensemble are no strangers to needing to adapt when it comes to the coronavirus, after dealing extensively with this issue last spring when campus was shut down. “Due to Zoom’s latency, it is impossible to play in time with each other” explained instrument performance music major (clarinet), Jacklyn Smith. “Instead, we spent the rest of the spring semester working on special projects,” said Smith. 
Professor McRoy, director of Wind Ensemble ensured the group was still able to make the most out of virtual learning. “We did a variety of different things,” said McRoy, “at the time we were working with a lot of music by composer Brian Balmages – preparing for our annual Band Festival when he would have been with us. In March-April, we did a deep dive on some of that music and did some analysis and other exploration.” 
In spite of their successful handling of the remote spring semester, students and faculty alike were grateful to be returning to in-person rehearsals. “After not having in-person rehearsals since early March, coming back to that environment is something I’ve really been looking forward to throughout these past few months” said Smith. This semester however, rehearsals will function differently than they ever have before, in order to ensure the group’s safety.
“We rehearse all spread out, six-plus feet apart…Percussionists wear gloves….Everyone has to use their own music stand. I wear a headset wireless mic broadcast through a speaker so everyone can hear me through my mask,” explained McRoy. 
Wind Ensemble has also had to deal with the added challenge of having woodwind and brass players, whose instruments require air flow in order to be played. Smith spoke about how these instrumentalists have found ways to play their instruments in a safe manner: “We made masks with a slit (so the mouthpiece fits through), and bell covers to further decrease the risk of contamination.”
 Even with masks, social distancing, gloves, and coverings on their instruments, Wind Ensemble has taken additional precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in their rehearsal space. “We rehearse for a period of time, then take a break for the air in our rehearsal hall to clean and change, then we return to continue to rehearse…There was a lot of scientific research done over the summer at the University of Colorado that we learned from on how to continue to make music in this environment,” explained McRoy, “It’s different, but it’s working.”
Now, the group is looking forward to what lays ahead for the remainder of the semester, including some virtual performances and events. “Right now, my plan is to record a performance in our rehearsal hall toward the middle of November – before Thanksgiving. We will then broadcast that via Zoom at a later date along with some interviews of students and perhaps some of the composers whose music we are preparing” said McRoy. This foresight and hardwork Professor McRoy has been putting into the group has not gone unappreciated by the students in the ensemble “[He] has worked extremely hard to ensure we have a wonderful and safe semester” said Smith.
With a successful method of holding safe rehearsals in place and some virtual events on the horizon, Wind Ensemble is excited for the rest of their semester of making music together, even if it’s done from six feet apart. “In rehearsal we talk openly about how great it is to be together doing what we love, and we also share openly what a challenge it is to do that in this environment. The key is to embrace it and not fight it. Turn every challenge into an opportunity to learn and grow” said McRoy.

The coronavirus pandemic has changed what the world once knew as normal. In-person activities, such as going to school and work, have taken on a new version of normality via virtual experiences. With many classes being moved online, hands-on professions like nursing have declined educationally because of the quality universities are able to teach these fields online.
When the coronavirus began spreading to college communities back in March 2020, universities sent students home, regardless of their major or area they were studying. Nursing students began taking classes online. For many, senior clinicals were cancelled for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester. 
Senior clinicals are an important time and experience for those about to graduate and enter the nursing field because they are a chance for students to work one-on-one with a nurse in a specific field of nursing, get real on-the-job experiences, and work in a hospital.
First-year registered nurse Jenna Doherty’s clinicals were canceled and she is now unsure about starting her first job at Stony Brook University Hospital. “I believe I missed out on a huge opportunity to learn on the job experience when my senior clinical was canceled,” Doherty said. “Now that I am beginning my first job I am a little nervous that I have not been in a hospital or practicing nursing since March and that my nursing skills are going to be rusty.”
Doherty is not alone in this. Many universities across the nation cancelled their clinical programs for the spring semester, meaning Doherty is just one among many who lost this experience and are now applying for jobs as registered nurses. 
Currently, only a few universities have resumed their senior clinicals. Long Island University Post campus is one of these schools. However, even the in-person clinicals are very different from how they were pre-COVID. 
“Clinicals are still very educational, however not as educational as they would usually be,” senior nursing student Amanda Masullo said. “We aren’t allowed to do certain things. For example, inserting an NG tube or basically anything that has to do with the patient’s mouth, nose, bodily fluids, etc. It’s a shame because these are the times when you’re supposed to do things hands on and learn and we’re kind of deprived of that.”
Across the nation,  nursing majors have had to be flexible and work within the different universities regulations. For example, universities are encouraging online courses, lectures, and labs. Nursing classes or simulations that were always taught in the classroom before the pandemic are now primarily online. 
Doherty, a recent graduate from Post whose senior spring semester of nursing school was moved online, said that she was very lucky to have professors who were dedicated to helping the students learn. However, in her opinion, taking the more information-heavy classes required for sophomores and juniors would have been much more difficult to take online. 
Another big change to the nursing major is how the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) examination is now taken and passed. The NCLEX examination is a nationwide test used to administer the licensing of nurses in the United States, Canada, and Australia. The test is set up to have students apply and analyze questions and scenarios that should have been taught and understood while in nursing school. After graduating, nursing students must pass this exam before they are deemed a qualified registered nurse.
Many changes have been made to this exam due to the coronavirus pandemic. The exam time has been shortened from six hours to four hours and they have decreased the amount of correct questions from 75 to 60 in order to pass the test. The maximum amount of questions has also been decreased from 265 questions to 130 questions. They have also removed pre-test questions and research section questions. 
The coronavirus pandemic is not only affecting those who are currently in nursing school, but is also heavily affecting those who recently finished school and are looking for jobs in the nursing field. 
Healthcare companies have also implemented a hiring freeze in many hospitals due to the coronavirus and this is making it difficult for those who have recently graduated to find jobs. Once recent graduates can find jobs, they are being required to do more online learning and simulations as a form of orientation. 
Doherty was just recently hired by Stony Brook University Hospital as a Neurology ICU nurse. Instead of in-person training and orientation, she is being required to take an online two-week orientation course. After finishing nursing school online and then having to continue training online, this orientation makes Doherty concerned and uneasy. “Usually during orientation, you get to learn the ropes of the hospital and where everything is,” she said. “Also during orientation, they bring you to a sim lab to go over a crash course of nursing fundamentals which will now all be online as a simulation.”
The integration of online learning for nursing school and job orientation is an impacting factor that is creating uneasiness and worry through the nation’s young and learning nurses. These impacts of the coronavirus in the medical field will have a lasting effect within healthcare.

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic illness that affects millions of families each year. According to the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, PD is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. Modern medicine and neurologists have been developing stronger and more effective treatments for this disease every year. 
Dr. Gemma Moya-Galé is a professor at LIU Brooklyn  and speech-language pathologist who researches PD. Her expertise can be most notably witnessed in her recently published article “The effects of intensive speech treatment on intelligibility in Parkinson’s disease: A randomised controlled trial”, where she discusses the newfound breakthroughs in the use of intensive speech treatment to improve speech intelligibility for those with PD.
“Our study was the first one to examine conversational intelligibility gains in a randomized controlled trial for PD and we were able to provide evidence of treatment benefits to improve that aspect of their lives. The clinical implications for this are, therefore, huge,” Moya-Galé said. 
Moya-Galé’s goal is to improve the quality of life in her and her colleagues’ patients. Her study that was published by the Lancet took six years to complete, and contained documented and verified research supporting both Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD) effectiveness, as well the importance of physical activity. 
“Close to 90% of people with PD develop voice problems over the course of the disease. One of the most devastating consequences patients face in their quality of life is social isolation and withdrawal, given that they lose the ability to be understood, particularly in noisy environments. Once voice problems have appeared and worsened, many patients may decide not to partake in conversations anymore, out of frustration, for example.” 
In order to get a better understanding of the disease itself, Moya Galé elaborated on what exactly the nature of the disease entails.
 “The disease is progressive and it may start long before a diagnosis is made, loss of smell could actually be one of the first signs. Getting the right treatment is crucial, as many times modifications to medication have to be made based on patients’ reactions to it.” 
LSVT LOUD treatment, is the most well researched and understood kind of treatment used to treat individuals. The LOUD part of the treatment, refers to patients using their loud voice, and emphasizes use of sounds like “AH” at various pitch tones, in order to rehabilitate their speech. 
“[LSVT LOUD] is currently the gold standard in the treatment of hypophonia in PD. It also has decades of research behind it that show its benefits in improving not only voice, but also facial expressions, or even swallowing,” she said. 
Moya-Galé said that LSVT LOUD has significantly improved intelligibility and patients with PD’s ability to be understood. This is important because there is a gap between the communication levels of the patient with PD and their caregivers. Improving the communication between the patient and the caregivers will improve the overall mental well being and stability of those with PD because they will know that they can still speak clearly enough to be understood. 
Moya-Galé believes that exercise is also essential to improving the neuroplasticity in patients with PD. Neuroplasticity is the concept that the brain can still learn, improve and remain malleable even within the patient’s final years being alive.
 “Physical activity not only improves aspects like balance and walking, remember that people with PD are at a greater risk of falls, so addressing these problems is very important for overall safety, but it can also increase quality of life, for example, by fostering and prolonging the individual’s independence,” she said.
Moya-Galé urges those with PD to begin rehabilitation as soon as possible.
“Rehabilitation is key in PD, and the earlier someone starts receiving those services (including physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and such) the better. Rehabilitation services undoubtedly improve quality of life and we, as therapists, advocate for their early implementation,” said Moya-Galé. 
While she does hope there will be a cure in the traditional sense, she still noted that there are factors within our control that can prevent the disease interfering drastically with the patients lives. 
“As for habits or factors that could have a protective role; exercise is key. Physical activity has tremendous benefits …  not just for maintaining good physical function but also cognitive function.” 
Moya-Galé continues to study PD and work as a speech pathologist in order to foster independence in patients so that they can keep their voice for as long as possible.
Her work not only continues to impact the lives of not just her patients, and their families, but the scientific community, who research PD and attempt to learn how to effectively treat those who develop PD, at any stage of their life.
For more information about speech therapy treatments for PD, refer to Moya-Galé’s research on “The Lancet”.

Colder weather on campus means that items like blankets are a must. The Long Island University Field Hockey team is selling blankets available for purchase. The blankets are $60 each and found  on their Instagram page @liufieldhockey. 
Field Hockey Head Coach Raenee Savin says that she got the inspiration for the blankets from a recruiting trip a few years ago. “I was recruiting at a high school field hockey playoff game in late November, and as I stood there freezing, all the fans in the stands were wrapped in their warm blankets, all matching and supporting their team,” she said. “Right after that, I placed our first order! It was perfect timing, as our field hockey team played into December for the NCAA finals.” 
This is not the first year the blankets have been for sale and the blankets have evolved with the school. “We started selling these blankets in the C.W. Post Pioneers generation of LIU. Sales continued as we kept the green and gold,” Coach Savin said. 
Coach Savin is confident the tradition of these blanket sales throughout the colder months of the year have been a success. “Still now, as we transitioned to the blue and gold, LIU Sharks blankets are keeping fans warm in the stands,”she said. “Eight years later, we continue to sell,and get excited with each sale, knowing that our customers are always happy with their purchase!”
While @liufieldhockey recently posted about the blankets, Savin says that anyone can buy the blankets at any time. “There is no end date. We just had a surge in blanket sales and placed another order, but we always have them available for purchase,” she said. 
Additionally, anyone can buy these blankets with shipping or pickup.“For a small additional fee, we are able to ship your blanket.  We also provide contactless pickup on campus,” Savin said. 
Savin encourages everyone to buy a blanket for their practicality and ties to campus. “These blankets are meant for everyone, not just sports fanatics! I keep one on my car and one on my couch. I use it when I travel,” she said  “These blankets wash easily, are super comfortable and are a great way to show off your Shark spirit, great for incoming freshmen or graduating seniors, a blanket in the dorm or even for an alum as a reminder of your years at LIU,”
You can email raenee.savin@liu.edu or brittany.robertson@liu.edu to purchase.

On Thursday, Sept. 30, the music department was given breaking news: the music education major is being frozen. This means that any incoming student at Post may not choose music education as a major, but the students who are already part of the program will be able to finish out their degree.
More news came for other arts students soon after. On Oct. 8, students in the department of theatre, dance and arts management received word that recruitment into the dance and arts management programs would freeze after this school year. 
With programs freezing, students are left wondering if they should stay at Post and what the future holds for their education.
“We got an email from Dr. McRoy who is the director of music education. He wasn’t beating around the bush at all. He just said ‘unfortunately the school has decided to freeze the music education major,’” sophomore music education major Ally Perticone said.
A large majority of the students found out this information while they were in chorus class.
“We were in chorus and everyone’s jaws dropped. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. After all the time and effort we put in,” senior music education major Kaitlyn Sottung said.
The music education majors and their faculty have worked hard to build their program.
“I want the administration to know that people are hurting. It’s not only us, it’s also the faculty. I feel very bad for everyone in my department, especially the faculty because I know how much hard work they put into this. I see the hard work that everyone puts in,” sophomore music education major Mike Shapiro said.
Students in the program thought that  all of their hard work and effort was paying off, especially seeing as the university advertises the music program on various media platforms.
“I think it’s just really unfair. The school portrays their music program and all the opportunities we have here as this great big deal, which it is,” Perticone said. “It’s a really good program we have here. But I hate that they portray it as something bigger than it is. If it’s so great, why are they getting rid of it?” 
There is even a banner on campus stating that Post was rated the best music school on Long Island.
“This program is so near and dear to me and to watch it be ripped away from future students is heartbreaking,” Sottung said.
Some students hope that others will join them in trying to fight for their program, while others think there’s no chance of restoration.
“When they took away the Fine Arts Center (FAC), we were able to advocate for ourselves and help restore the program by having the school put practice rooms in Hillwood. So, I think if we really get the word out and talk to higher administration to fight for our program, it might help,” Shapiro said.
“I personally think that fighting for it isn’t going to work. This is not something we can change their minds on. I don’t think it’s worth trying for,” Perticone said.
The next steps for the music program are unclear at this time, as students and faculty alike continue to grapple with this sudden change despite the decision that the school’s administration made. It’s clear the music community on campus is still strong, and will continue to focus on their craft as long as the school’s administration allows them to.
Students from the dance and arts and administration department are also fighting for their programs.
Junior dance major Abby Steinke recalls all of the opportunities she has received through Post’s dance program.
“We’ve had the opportunity to see companies and work with artists that are high calibre. We’ve been able to choreograph ourselves, like I’ve gotten to choreograph and make my own artistic voice show,” Steinke said.
Steinke says that the Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC) is like a family. She doesn’t think she would be the person she is today without it.
Steinke and the rest of PCDC found out Friday Oct. 8 that their program was to be frozen at the end of the year.
“I was shocked,” Steinke said. “The first thing I wanted to do was be like, okay what can we do to stop it? I’ve been emailing administration, and I messaged the theatre company to email them. I think strength in numbers really works. I think if everyone has something to say about it, then they should listen.”
Steinke has some ideas on how to get the campus’ attention, other than emailing.
“We’re thinking of doing some video things, maybe some flash mobs. The dance program has a big presence in the department, but we need to make that known to campus,” Steinke said.
Steinke believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on this decision. She says that last year the dance program was meant to bring in 13 new students, but ended up only bringing in three. 
“I think we need a chance to grow as a program through the pandemic and not getting a chance seems unfair,” Steinke said.
Steinke’s next steps are getting as much attention as possible from as many people as she can.
“Email your president, email Promise, email your dean, email our dean, email chairs; email anyone you can. These programs are important and they are bringing more people to this school. They are bringing culture to this school, arts to this school,” Steinke said.
Steinke urges the administration who is cutting these programs to listen to the students.
 “Please listen to the student body, please listen to what we have been sending you, please reconsider the freeze,” Steinke said.

Lucid Motors(LCID) 
The electric vehicle industry is exploding, and Lucid Motors is no exception. CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson was previously the VP of engineering at Tesla, and was also the head engineer of the Tesla Model S. After working high up under Elon Musk, Rawlinson moved onto Lucid in 2013, and is now the main man on the business and tech side of one of Tesla’s top potential competitors. Lucid has jumped nearly 100%, almost doubling in one month, and now sits at $44 a share with a market cap of $72 Billion. Lucid is still yet to sell cars on the road, but have been test driving the Lucid Air and Lucid Air Dream, with all of their production models sold out. These units should be given to the public by early next year, as well as 20,000 additional units manufactured, sold, and put on the road.
Coinbase(COIN)
With the Crypto market cap eclipsing over $3 trillion, the top exchange in the world is seeing the benefits. As Bitcoin and other cryptos eclipse all time highs, more people are looking to get in on the action. After fluctuating back and forth since its IPO on April 14, Coinbase is up over 50% in a little over a month, now listed at $357 a share, with a market cap of $93 Billion. 
Visa(V)
On the other hand, Visa has been taking a tumble it’s all-time-high over the summer. However, this does not seem to be something worth stressing over for shareholders, as retail and blue chip stocks have their down quarters every once in a while. We saw quick rebounds for Visa during the pandemic when people got back to work, and continued to use credit as interest rates went down tremendously last fall. Visa is trading at $213 a share, with a market cap of $465 Billion. 
Litecoin(LTC)
As previously mentioned, the crypto industry is soaring, and the hype around alt-coins(alternatives to Bitcoin) is going up with time and knowledge of the sector. Litecoin is one of the oldest alt-coins with a strong backing and history. Litecoin is up nearly 45% in the past week alone, and is stretching towards its all-time-high of $412. After taking a tumble in May, we have seen slow steady growth up to $266, and a market cap of $19 Billion. The longevity and consistency of Litecoin looks to be good long term.

The NBA season kicked off on Tuesday, Oct.19, and the landscape of the league might not look how many would have expected it. Teams predicted to be at the top of their conferences have struggled, while some teams have blown away expectations in the early going. 
One team that has caught some fans off guard is the Golden State Warriors.
Junior broadcasting major Ryan Boettcher has very high expectations for Golden State.  
“I think the Warriors have the most well-rounded team in the NBA,” he said. 
Boettcher believes that the Nets likely have the most star power and that the two teams should be considered the “main championship contenders” in their respective conferences. The Warriors, who are in first place in the West ahead of the surging Phoenix Suns and the Utah Jazz, are now expecting star Klay Thompson to return before Christmas Day, according to The Athletic.
Other success stories have come as a surprise to fans.
“Some teams that have surprised me have been the Cavaliers with the great play from Evan Mobley, and then the Wizards with their subtraction of Westbrook for Dinwiddie and many Lakers role players,” Boettcher said.
The third pick in the 2021 NBA Draft, Evan Mobley, is an early contender for rookie of the year and has been better than expected. Cleveland has had a better record than most would have predicted at the start of the year, in part due to the addition of veteran point guard Ricky Rubio.
It hasn’t all been positive. Boettcher expressed there are some teams underperforming their abilities.
“A team that has disappointed me has to be the Timberwolves. This season was really the first time their main core have been healthy together, and they have been underwhelming,” Boettcher said.
While second-year guard Anthony Edwards has raised his scoring to 23 points per game, star center Karl-Anthony Towns has not taken the next step as a leader that many Timberwolves fans would have liked to see in order to make Minnesota a serious contender.
The hometown New York Knicks face questions about their rotation, as their bench lineup is one of the most effective in the NBA while the starters have struggled to build chemistry. The bench lineup features five returning players in Derrick Rose, Immanuel Quickley, Alec Burks, Obi Toppin, and Taj Gibson, while the starters have struggled to incorporate new additions Kemba Walker and Evan Fournier.

Post is home to the inaugural class of the Positive Transitions to Work (PTW) program. The program is offered through Positive Behavior Support (PBS) Consultation in collaboration with the campus’ Center for Community Integration.
PTW is a two year program where college aged adults with developmental disabilities can learn vocational skills in a group of cohorts. The PTW program focuses on supporting independence and personal growth.
Students are exposed to six different career field options identified as important by the US Department of Labor; human Resources, business, communications, health, agriculture and manufacturing.
Though only in its inaugural year, the PTW program is being well received by students.
“I’m loving it so far. I learned that I appreciate not just writing but also there’s several other jobs people can take and how each of those jobs contribute to society whether low or high,” PTW student Victor Hoang said.
Hoang loves art, writing and fiction. 
”It’s a very calm, peaceful environment where we do group sessions and activities as a group, so that we’ll be given time to learn and develop,” Hoang said.
Hoang has been working towards the goal of providing for himself and his family through the PTW program.
“I wish to work independently and lead a more independent life, and also to help my mother make some money in order to live a fulfilling life, and in order to do that I need to learn how to work,” Hoang said.
Behind every student there is a mentor. Hoang’s mentor is Victoria Arias. Arias is part of Post’s early childhood education masters program.
”I just look forward to coming and hanging out with Victor. He’s given me some movie recommendations. We just learn more about each other everyday. It’s been a great experience, and meeting everyone else too has been fun,” Arias said.
Arias signed on to be a mentor for the PTW program in order to fulfill some hours needed for a course, but ended up staying for the experience.
“I had never worked with anyone with any developmental disabilities, I have some family members that have some disabilities, but this was the first time for me. This was for a class to get some hours, but honestly, I’ve done more than I ever had to for class just because I enjoy spending time here,” Arias said.
Arias says she learned confidence from Hoang. He is far more outgoing than her, while she is more of an introvert.
“I never really put myself out there to try new things, I never thought that I would be a mentor for anyone. I just think this is a great opportunity and I hope to continue,” Arias said.
The PTW program interviews less than half of the applicants they receive applications from, and accepts less than half of those interviewed. The program is selective, but this ensures the students coming in are ready to work.
One hope Arias and Hoang share for the PTW program is that the Post community would be more receptive to them. 
“I wish more people knew about the program and signed on to be a mentor and tried to include them in the community and be friends with them too,” Arias said.
Hoang wishes more people knew about the program, and signed up to be part of it as well. 
“I want them to know that if they know somebody that has a developmental disability of some sort. A young adult looking for a purpose in life, I recommend them coming here, where they can learn about themselves,” Hoang said.
Hoang encourages anyone on the Post campus to introduce themselves to any PTW student, they are looking to be a part of the campus community as well.For more information on the PTW program, visit https://www.positivebehavior.org/ptw.html.

Letter to the readers,
Not only is the season changing, there ís a new air on campus.  It’s not that fresh cool breeze that slips through your window screens at night either.  Students are a little rambunctious and more energetic than usual this week.  You might have even seen some familiar faces- former students or faculty (cough, cough alumni.)  The athletic teams, especially the football team, have more adrenaline pumping through their veins because this is just any weekend for Post.  It’s Homecoming weekend!!
This is the one weekend that current and past Postonians take the most pride in. Essentially it’s the one time of the year when the entire school really comes together.  Students gather at the pep rally on Friday night.  The residence halls compete for the best and most creative skit, athletic teams are introduced for the seasons, a DJ provides the music and suddenly you are caught up with the crowd that’s singing some song you don’t even know.  But you sure as hell are having a fun time!  Then Saturday comes and everyone watches the football game on Hickox field.  There’s tailgating in the Pratt parking lot, families of students come from all over the states, alumni return to play in athletic games or just to come and enjoy the day with their alma mater!
If you’re a freshmen, than you have to experience this for yourself.  Trust us, this is not an event to miss at Post.  But before we get too carried away, lets introduce the sixth edition of our student newspaper.  Many interesting articles this week; one focuses on the increase of tuition, while one of our editors discusses the two primary candidates for New York governor.  In sports, both the boys and girls cross-country teams traveled to sunny Florida and came back with a few record-breaking times.
As for our arts and entertainment section of Loomings, we are still looking for anyone interested in writing book, movie or game reviews.  Please email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.comÖdonít forget, we are still looking for that 50th email to give away that $500 prize!
From your staff of the Pioneer, Happy Homecoming and good luck Pioneers!

The C.W. Post Pioneers will not extend their season past this weekend. Post will not be involved in a PSAC Championship game. There will be no playoffs. And while the Pioneers outscored the Cheyney Wolves last week, the team may have proven why it won’t be in the postseason.
Cheyney is one of the worst teams in Division II. The team hasn’t had a winning season since 1979. Going back to 1995, the Wolves have a cumulative record of 8-161-1. Out of 151 Division II teams, the Wolves have the 134th offense. Any team should be able to stop their offense.
Go back to last week’s game. The Pioneers defeat the Wolves 63-28. Sure nine touchdowns on offense is a great stat but the defense gave up four. One of the problems with the Pioneers this year is the players’ demeanor on defense. There is no consistency from game to game. One week, the defense is all-world. The next, the squad surrenders points and puts the burden on the offense’s shoulders.
So many times this year, the Pioneers have given up easy yards. For the most part, they have been unable to stop their opponent’s rushing attack. This past week against one of the worst offenses in the nation, the Pioneers watched Cheyney run for 314 yards. Through 10 games, the Pioneers have given up 174 rushing yards per game.
Clearly that type of defense is not conducive of a playoff team. There have been so many instances this season where the defense should have or needed to come up big but fell short. As Coach Bryan Collins always points out to me, football has three phases. And while the offense has done well fighting through injuries, the special teams working through its own issues, the defense has not.
Regardless, there is room to grow for C.W. Post. The defense is full of young players. Donovan Edwards has started at cornerback as a true freshman. Sean Smith was having an excellent year before his knee injury and the vast majority of the starting defense will return next year.
But with one more game left against a solid slippery rock team, the Pioneers have an opportunity to reach seven wins and improve their record from last season. They’ll be in line to win as long as they can play a shutdown defense.

A Mexican Christmas celebration called Los Posadas was celebrated on campus, on Wednesday, Dec. 5. In Spanish, Las Posadas means “the inns” or ”the lodgings” and represents the Biblical journey of Mary and Joseph as they searched for a shelter in Bethlehem before the birth of Jesus.

“This is the Catholic event on Christmas season,” said Father Ted Brown, the chaplain at LIU Post’s Interfaith Center. “From nine days before to the Christmas Eve, Latin American Catholics do this custom every night,” he stated.
Traditionally in Mexico, people gather in a neighborhood home to have a party each night from Dec. 16 to 24. Children get dressed as shepherds, angels, Mary, and Joseph. An angel leads the guests carrying candles to the house—in this case, a dorm. They sing a carol to ask for shelter, and then the host sings a reply regarding their request. After that, guests are welcome to have a party. They end the party with a pinata shaped like the Christmas star. The last day of Las Posadas is on Dec. 24, which is followed by midnight mass, the celebration of Jesus Christ.
People who took part in the custom gathered in the campus chapel, and then the journey began. Students played pilgrims who traveled from house to house searching until they reached a designated home where Las Posadas would be celebrated. First, they made rounds to each dorm, carrying candles with them. When a group of around 15 students reached each dorm, they sang a carol such as “Joy to the World.” After going around the dorms, they went to the Interfaith Center, which is regarded as the shelter, and decorated the chapel.
“I came to join this because it sounded fun,” said Aimee Biernacki, sophomore Healthcare Administration major. “It is a good way to come together with other students, so I want to come back again next year,” she added.
This was the fourth celebration for Matt Mason, senior Criminal Justice major. “As it gives me [a sense of] community, I came to this since I entered LIU Post,” he stated. Mason added that he would have wanted join this seasonal custom even if he weren’t a Catholic.
“Originally, Las Posadas is a Catholic custom, but it is not only for the Catholic on campus” said David Armas, junior Sociology major, who is the vice president of the Newman Club Catholic Community, LIU Post’s Catholic student organization. He continued, “Las Posadas this year was really successful. Many people stayed [until] around 11 p.m. to decorate the chapel.”
The Interfaith Center is currently decorated with a Christmas tree, along with green and red lights. The decoration was done by those who took part in Las Posadas.

People might think that Greek life is all about the parties, cliques, and frat houses, because movies portray them that way. However, this isn’t the movies, this is LIU Post. At this university, there are no fraternity houses or cliques, but Greek life is a “community of students who are initiated into one of our recognized fraternities or sororities,” said Katherine Wieme, Director of Greek Life & Student Involvement, a position in Campus Life.
Wieme explained that it offers students opportunities to bond, strengthen leadership qualities, and network with alumni. There are 11 fraternities and sororities on campus: Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Delta Zeta, Phi Sigma Kappa, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and Chi Nu Alpha.
“We currently have over 250 students in fraternities and sororities,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life. “We are proud to now be home to some of the largest national organizations in the world and are excited to add Sigma Delta Tau to our community in the spring
[2016].”These organizations are not all the same; they have different recruitment processes, structures, and types of councils. The three types of councils are the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Association, or the Multicultural Council. Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Phi Epsilon, and Delta Zeta are Panhellenic sororities. Tau Kappa Epsilon, Phi Sigma Kappa, Theta Chi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon are fraternities a part of the Interfraternity Council. Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Tau, and Chi Nu Alpha, are the fraternities and sororities that belong to the Multicultural Council.
“Being in a cultural organization differs from other organizations because we’re very passionate about our organization’s history and the meaning behind the letters; we take pride in the roots of where we come from,” said Richard Batista, President of Phi Iota Alpha, and a senior adolescence education major in mathematics. Batista also explains that one thing you learn is that you should “never forget who you are and where you come from.”
Each fraternity and sorority has a philanthropy that they partner with. “In DZ [Delta Zeta], we raise money and awareness for our philanthropy Speech and Hearing, to try to make a difference in other people’s lives,” said Nicole Cunningham, President of DZ and graduate literacy education major. Their philanthropy focuses on those that are affected by speech and hearing challenges.
“Engaging in community service projects and raising funds and awareness for various philanthropic organizations are fundamental components of being an active member of a Greek organization,” said Alexa Regina, President of Alpha Phi Epsilon, and a senior social work major. She mentions that AEPHI “values service, which has allowed me to give back to the community with the help of my
sisters.”It can be hard to find your place in college. Now that doesn’t mean your clique or “it” group, but a group of people that help you find yourself and enjoy your college and life experience. Greek life can help “students to find their home in a fraternity or sorority,” Wieme said.
“Joining Greek life is so important because when you join your org, you are also joining a community,” said Giovanna Domingo, Financial VP of Alpha Xi Delta, and sophomore accounting major. “Over the last year I have seen such a positive change in Greek life. Even if you don’t know a person and you’re wearing letters, you always have something to talk about because there is that common thread.” She explained that more people have joined, which has shown such a positive growth.
These organizations have made an impact on many students and the campus itself. “Joining Greek life has without a doubt been one of the best decisions I’ve made in college. It’s gotten me way more involved than I ever was before on campus and it’s equipped me with invaluable leadership opportunities,” said Jawaan Smith, VP of Phi Sigma Kappa, a senior arts management major. “Also, knowing you have 20 plus guys who always have your back and are there for you through your highs and lows is a great feeling. It’s definitely a rewarding experience.”
“We are proud that our Greek Life students are also active in student organizations, residence halls, athletic teams, and student run businesses,” Wieme said.
“Being in Greek life means being involved, but still the most important job is for you to be a student. The hardest part about Greek Life is time management,” according to Michael Aquilano, Programing Director of Phi Sigma Kappa and sophomore psychology major.
“When you join Greek Life, you become a part of something that is very active and you need to learn or already have time management skills. Especially if you want to hold and E-board or chair position,” he said.
Wieme explained that the Office of Campus Life serves as the primary advisor to Greek life, including all the governing councils, organizations, and individual members and that they support the growth of these organizations. Campus Life “maintains a Greek life expansion policy for any organization who is interested in becoming recognized on campus,” she said.
“All of our organizations are national with chapters across the country,” Wieme said. “Post students who join a fraternity or sorority will have the opportunity to attend conventions, network with alumni, and meet fellow members from other institutions.”
Berthel added that Campus Life, and the university fully support the fraternities and sororities. “Providing opportunities for students to take part in Greek life is very important to us and we will continue to look
for ways to grow and strengthen our current organizations and add new organizations,” he said. If you think Greek life is for you: go out and meet the different organizations during Greek week or Greek events, which are held every semester and maybe you’ll find your new home.

How many “selfies” does it take to settle on the “perfect” picture? How many times have you posted a “fire” picture onto social media, but your peers didn’t reciprocate (like the photo), so you deleted it? Although the players remain the same, the games and the rules of which the players play by, have changed ten-fold.
Once upon a time, well, really before all of these social media sites, we would look at each other on the Starbucks line, and make our judgments from there. However, “We now look at the person’s Instagram first, make our first judgment, and then we take it from there,” said senior history major, Kathy Rice. “I can name 1,000 times where some guy would like [my posts] on Instagram, I guess showing interest in
me, but then in person, no social contact, none whatsoever,” she added.
When Rice told me this story, I literally, “loled,” but this really is no laughing matter.
Let’s me ask you again, why does it take 200 pictures to get that one perfect selfie?! To be honest, folks, I think I have that answer. The mini photo shoot we partake in when we want to post a picture on social media is caused by something I would like to call, “Social Perfection,” a.k.a delusion.
I believe that social media is driving our youth to the brink of insanity as it causes them to feel the need to to “qualify” within their respective social groups. For example, Marcella Anteri, a Suffolk County High School physics teacher, recalled a story about one of her students and social media.
“One of my juniors, who will remain nameless, came to me at the end of class,” said Anteri. “That class, she did none of her physics homework, and totally bombed my quiz. She came to me, and before she could say anything, tears began pouring from her face.”
Anteri later revealed that her student’s disarray stemmed from her fear that she was being judged off of her social media posts. According to Anteri, her student told her, “I accidentally liked my friend’s ex-boyfriend’s picture, and they’ve been ignoring me all week.”
We all know being in high school can come with its times of social hardship to say the least, but if you think about it, social media just adds to that fire we deal with in our adolescent years. In the age of social media and texting, misinterpretation and cyberbullying have run rampant. It has led Mike Kurtz, a junior education major, across the street at NYIT to stop texting all together.
“You really wouldn’t believe how many fights [with friends] I’ve gotten into because I didn’t answer a text within three minutes, or reply ‘lol’ instead of replying ‘lmfao,’” Kurtz said. “I remember one time where a girl I was dating told me a joke, at which I replied [over text], ‘lol.’ She later texted saying, ‘I haven’t liked your attitude all day and that last text proves you’re giving me one right now.’”
“I never texted her back after that, because I knew where it was going to go,” said Kurtz. “If I have something to say, or want to talk to you then I’m just going to call you. I’m bringing back the phone call!”
Social media to me is a synthetic form of human interaction; a form of interaction, which in most cases that does us more harm than good. Yes, social media links us beyond the classroom and to each corner of the Earth; however, Instagram, Twitter, even Facebook, and Snapchat, have become portfolios, or as I’d like to call them, “baseball cards” to track our latest social undertakings, misleadingly presenting them to our peers.
Posting a picture of your lavish vacations, the new car, your selfie, taken from an angle that probably led you to sprain your wrist and shoulder, and not to mention your “following to followers ratio.” Social Media allows us to portray ourselves in our “best” light, and that’s great! What if social media just further enhances the saying “perception is reality,” in a world where everyone’s perception of each other is derived of social media. It makes me wonder if we are losing our authenticity, and that’s kind of scary. Well, too scary to me at least.

To the Editors of the Pioneer:
On Wednesday, I posted a response to the excellent letter Editor Caroline Ryan published in the Pioneer. In my post, I expressed admiration for the clarity of her argument, and sadness that a student newspaper faces such deplorable conditions in trying to report campus news. This stance of complete message control on the part of the administration is antithetical to the concept of academic freedom and freedom of the press. It is demoralizing to the student journalists and heartbreaking for faculty members who work with them. It also makes our journalism program a hard sell to potential students who want the experience of working on a vital and relevant paper, not a University Public Relations mouthpiece, and discover that cannot happen here.
I am writing this letter as an addendum to my brief Facebook post (which seems to have disappeared) after learning that copies of this week’s Pioneer seem to have been removed from the campus before visitors to Homecoming and the Admissions Open House could grab them. This has happened before. It also happens at the Brooklyn Campus. It is shocking to see this go on in a campus community. I am appalled that our administration thinks this approach is somehow beneficial to our university, when in fact it does damage to all of us.

Two of the five deans of the schools and colleges on campus are interim, acting deans. One was appointed earlier this year and the other was appointed last week. Only one of the five deans has been in place for more than a year.
On Oct. 6, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane, sent a campus-wide email stating Dr. Albert Inserra, the former president of Dowling College, has been appointed dean of the college of education, information and technology. Inserra replaces Louisa Kramer-Vida, who was the acting dean of the college of education, information and technology.
Vida-Kramer is the chairperson of the department of special education as well as an assistant professor in the department. She was approached to take the position of acting dean in mid-June 2016, and began the position on Jul. 1. Kramer replaced Dr. Barbara Garii, the former dean of the college of education, information and technology, who became the vice president for academic affairs of St. Joseph’s College on Jul. 18.
As the Pioneer reported in its Oct. 5 issue, Jeffrey Belnap, the dean of LIU Global, has been appointed the acting dean of the college of liberal arts, succeeding chemistry Professor Nicholas Ramer, who was the acting dean of the college from June 2015 to August 2016. Ramer replaced former Dean Katherine Hill-Miller, who stepped down from the position in 2015 and returned to her position as a professor in the English department.
Art therapy professor, Christine Kerr, became the acting dean of the college of art, communications and design on Sept. 1, succeeding Noel Zahler, who left the University in August.
Stacey Gopack, who was the acting dean of the School of Health Professions last year, is the newly appointed permanent dean of that school.
Only Robert Valli, the dean of the College of Management, has been in his position since 2015.
Some students have expressed confusion and frustration about the coming and going of the deans. Senior economics major Marvin Johnson has had positive experiences with going to deans for help throughout his academic career. Johnson feels that with many of the deans stepping down and the administration constantly needing to find new replacements, many students may begin to feel lost. “Some students have a unique bond with certain deans and by them switching up and resigning, it just makes the students feel not wanted,” Johnson said. “It’s like a puppy with a new owner.”

After a five-year absence from the big screen, J.K. Rowling brings audiences back to the world of Harry Potter with her new movie, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.”
Taking place in 1926 New York instead of modern-day England, the film is a prequel to the Harry Potter series and contains Rowling’s first screenplay. While she is the author of the Harry Potter books, Steve Kloves and Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplays for the movies.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” was originally published as a book in 2001, Rowling used the name Newt Scamander, who is the main character of the movie because the book was published as the actual textbook used by Harry Potter in the novels. The movie is not based on the book like Harry Potter was, but is an original story crafted by Rowling.
This is the first of a five-film franchise planned by Rowling and Warner Bros. studios that will see the series stretch from 1926-1945 and will include pivotal characters such as Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” stars Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander; Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein; Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski; Alison Sudol as Queenie Goldstein and Colin Farrell as Graves. Ezra Miller and Jon Voight also play supporting roles.
Newt Scamander is a wizard who travels the world collecting different types of magical creatures and stops by New York on his way to Arizona. While in New York, his creatures are accidentally set loose and he must enlist the help of witches Tina and Queenie Goldstein, sisters who work at the Magical Congress of the United States (MACUSA), and non-wizard Jacob. Together they must return to find Newt’s creatures while avoiding the detection of Percival Graves, the Director of Magical Security at MACUSA.
A strength of the movie is the performances of the actors, particularly Eddie Redmayne and Dan Fogler. Redmayne easily takes the franchise reigns from Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe and anchors the Fantastic Beasts series behind his performance. He successfully portrays Newt’s insecurity around humans and is able to contrast that aspect of his personality with his more outgoing nature while spending time with his creatures.
Fogler is able to take what could have been a typical side character and elevate him to one of the core characters by the end of the movie. While Fogler’s performance originally starts out as comedic, he becomes more reserved and sympathetic as several emotional moments throughout the movie revolve around his character.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” also benefits from being written by J.K. Rowling instead of a screenwriter unfamiliar with the world she has created. Her imagination is so expansive that there is no shortage of interesting characters and creatures throughout the movie. Rowling even includes several references to the Harry Potter series and other material not in the books.
There are very few things holding this movie back from being perfect. While all of the main characters are fleshed out, some of the secondary characters are relegated to the sidelines, in particular, Jon Voight’s and Carmen Ejogo’s characters. The movie can also seem busy at some points with several plot threads occurring at once. While this should be expected from a first-time screenwriter, it is not a main issue as Rowling was able to successfully accomplish this while writing Harry Potter.
Since the last Harry Potter movie was released five years ago and the last novel nine years ago, it was possible that interest in Rowling’s work had dwindled and that “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” would underperform at the box office. However, backed by Redmayne’s leading man performance and Rowling’s unique storytelling, the movie has made its budget back at the box office and has successfully started a new franchise. The movie is now playing in theaters.

At 11:05 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 17, the office of Public Safety sent an announcement via email and text message notifying students and faculty that the library would be closed for two days. According to the notice, “the library will be closed effective immediately and will reopen Thursday, Oct. 19 at 12 noon. Efforts are being made to relocate the afternoon and evening classes that were scheduled in the library to other campus buildings. Class relocations will be posted at the library’s entrance. Updates will be emailed through LIU email.” The notification did not state the reason for the closing of the library.
In response to the Pioneer’s inquiries, Head of Public Safety Michael Fevola stated in an email that the library was closed because of wasp infestation. “LIU Post Facilities Staff and a contracted exterminator located a bee’s nest in the attic of the library and took immediate action to eradicate the nest and protect the health and safety of the public. The exterminator began professional treatment to remove the nest and treat the building. The treatment requires that the building is vacated for 48 hours.”
Faculty members with offices in the library were unexpectedly displaced due to the library’s unplanned closing. Classes were reassigned to rooms in different buildings. The Information Technology department was temporarily moved to the Browse store in Hillwood Commons. IT has “spread over what available space we have; they are utilizing the work room and the desk they already have for daily use. So far we’ve adjusted pretty nicely,” Albert Donor, a senior broadcasting major and Browse store associate, said.
Shaireen Rasheed, a professor of education, was the last professor to leave her office when she got word of the library’s wasp infestation. “I just took everything out of my office that I need for the next two days,” she said. “I’m trying to make a makeshift office wherever I can find wifi.” Rasheed has office hours set up for students to visit, she’s been holding meetings in Hillwood Commons. She had to post-pone a Skype meeting due to the lack of privacy available. Rasheed had just enough notice to remove her important belongings from the library so that her work has not been adversely affected by her removal from her office.
According to Fevola, rooms are reserved in Hillwood Commons for students to use as quiet study and computer space. Students who have questions regarding their classroom location may contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299- 2800.
Although the original notification informed students that the library would reopen at noon on Friday, Oct. 20, students did not receive a notice that the library had reopened until 2:13 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 20. The notice sent by Public Safety via the LIU Alert email system, stated that the library had reopened, thanked the community for its patience, and informed students and faculty that the library had resumed normal operating hours.
During this three and a half day library closure, students had to find other places to study, have internet access, and print out work. They were unable to take out books or use the library’s reference services, other than by email. Dean of Students Michael Berthel informed students by email that the library maintained virtual reference services to answer reference, catalog, and database questions via post-ref@liu.edu.
“The library faculty did a great job maintaining the online chat reference and email reference services,” Thomas Walker, associate dean of the college of education, information, and technology, and director of the Palmer school of library and information science, said. 


Students received no further notifications regarding the measures taken to remove the bees.

“Additional precautionary measures were put in place to ensure the continued safety of the community,” Berthel said.

At 6:57 a.m. on a rainy Monday morning, Oct. 30, an announcement was sent via email and text message to students and faculty notifying them that all Monday classes would be cancelled. According to the notice, “due to a power outage, all classes at LIU Post are cancelled for today, Monday, October 30. Faculty and administrative offices are closed. For Tilles Center call 516-299- 3100. Library closed.” Many parts of Long Island had lost power due to the heavy rains and winds throughout the night on Sunday.
The university sent a second email, an hour later, to inform students what services would be open on campus. “Public Safety, Facilities, Dining, and Campus Life staff are fully prepared to service the campus throughout the outage,” the email said. The shuttle bus service to Hicksville was operating on a regular schedule. However, the only available dining option for students was Winnick Student Center, which operated on an extended schedule from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Campus Life staff held activities to keep students occupied during the day, including bingo and Monday night football in the Winnick Student Center Gold Coast room. Members of the campus life staff and resident assistants were available in the residence hall lobbies throughout the day.
Michael Berthel, dean of students, confirmed the buildings affected by the power outage. “On Oct. 30, several buildings on the LIU Post campus were affected by a power outage due to an off-campus issue. As a result of the outage, most academic buildings, the Pratt Recreation Center, Library, and Hillwood Commons were operating on emergency power,” he wrote in an email responding to the Pioneer’s inquiries. “LIU Post Facilities coordinated with PSEG to address the issue and return power to the campus. Without being able to open essential buildings, the decision was made to cancel classes for the day,” he said.
Sam Scarito, a freshman early childhood education major, lives on campus. “The power outage was pretty inconvenient for me. Post Hall was out for the majority of the night, and people were in the hallways doing their homework.
I wasn’t able to set an alarm and I honestly wondered if I’d wakeup for class or not,” she said. Notification of the school closure was sent via text message and email at 6:57 a.m., when many commuter students and professors were already on their way to their 8 a.m. classes. Jamie Leigh, a senior forensic science major, was driving to her 8 a.m. class when she got the notification. “I usually do not check my phone while I am driving but I had my phone propped on my dashboard while using a navigation app. I feel like this happens all the time. The school should know a significant amount of students commute to school and should have taken into consideration how far some students commute. One hour before the first set of classes is not enough time to notify students,” Leigh said. Freshman accounting major Amanda Norton was an hour into her commute to school. “I think they should’ve sent that message earlier. It’s dumb to wait until 7 a.m. when there [are] commuters with early classes who are already on the road. I wasted my time and gas,” she said.
Michael Semler, a junior international business major also leaves early in the morning to get to classes on time but feels that this power outage could have been prevented. “[The university] should make sure that anything at risk, like equipment servers, [are] secured and contingencies should be in place when equipment fails,” he said.
The Pioneer has previously reported on hurricane preparedness. In “Storm Preparedness In the Wake of Hurricane Nate,” By Jada Butler in the Oct. 10 issue, the Pioneer reported that many buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the event of a power outage. “Several buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the case of a power outage, those being Pell, Hoxie, Roth and Kahn Halls, Humanities, the Winnick and McGrath Houses, Hillwood Commons, the Pratt Recreation Center, the Little Theater and Theater & Film building, the Tilles Center, the library, and all in-use residence halls,” according to the Oct. 10 article. “All other buildings, including the Chapel, the music and sculpture buildings, the Fine Arts Center, and Lorber Hall are equipped with backup emergency lighting.”
According to Berthel, the outage was not caused by an on-campus issue. PSEG, the electric provider for Long Island, was responsible for repairing the power lines to restore power to campus. Power was restored at approximately 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 30. Classes resumed on Tuesday, Oct. 31 on a regular Tuesday schedule. Students have not received any notification about whether the Monday classes will be made up.

“The School for Good and Evil” by Soman Chainani is the first book in a fantastic fantasy series. This first book tells the story of best friends Sophie and Agatha, living in the isolated town of Gavaldon. Every four years on November 11, according to legend, a School Master kidnaps two children from the village. One kidnapped child is always beautiful and kind, and the other is homely and odd. These children are taken to the School for Good and Evil, which exists somewhere beyond the woods surrounding Gavaldon. The children are never seen again, unless they appear in a fairy tale, one as a hero and the other as a villain.
Sophie, who is beautiful and focuses on her looks and good deeds, believes that she will be kidnapped for the School for Good. Meanwhile, Agatha, who is ugly and wears only black, doesn’t believe the School exists but seems like the perfect candidate for the School for Evil. They are the two kids who are kidnapped by the School Master that year. However, Agatha is brought to the School for Good, and Sophie to the School for Evil. What first appears to be a great mistake turns into an adventure that not only reveals the character’s truest selves, but also blurs the lines between the stereotypes of good and evil.
Along the way, Sophie and Agatha meet the other students, who are descendants of fairytale characters. The best friends from Gavaldon take classes at their mismatched schools while they try to solve a riddle the School Master gave them that will lead them home. However, the School Master is more than what he seems, and has a different ending in store for Sophie and Agatha.
“The School for Good and Evil” is a very entertaining book, but the plot doesn’t go far beyond the school. Although this series takes place in a much larger world, the first book takes place only in Gavaldon and the School. The world of fairy tales is supposedly endless, but readers don’t get to experience much of this world in the first book. One must read the rest of the series to see more of this magical world of Good and Evil.
In “The School for Good and Evil,” nothing is as simple as it seems. It is a great read for those who like dramatic twists and sneaky foreshadowing in their books.

Women’s rugby’s sophomore forward, Sydney Long plays an important role as one of the team’s top players. The team won their last game of the fall season, over Molloy College with 27-12, and Long led the team in tackles and scored a try. Long also scored tries in three other games throughout the season.
The rugby team finished their fall season with an overall record of 2-6. Long says it was a “growing season” for the team as it was the first time in program history they were able to play 15 vs. 15 competitions. She also mentioned the younger members of the team, as there are only six upperclassmen out of 18 players. Long said it took some time for the team to work through different concepts and to come together. 
However, Long is very proud of how the team united towards the end of the fall season. “At the end, we finally pulled it together and we worked really hard and we did really well our last three competitions,” she said. 
The LIU rugby team is not a member of the NCAA, rather they are a part of the NIRA, the National Intercollegiate Rugby Association. Because of this, when the university announced the merger be-tween NCAA Division I and Division II, it did not directly affect the rugby team. However, Long says their team has felt positive impacts of the university’s move to Division I. “We get the prospects of the upgraded athletic training room, obviously the money for scholarships, and the money for new gear,” she said. “So that was a really big help this year.”
Long, a Tennessee native, came to Long Island to work towards pursuing a career in the FBI. “I want to be in the FBI, and I thought that the biggest police hub, in my mind, was in New York. So, I knew I wanted to come up north and be as close to a big hub as possible,” she said. Long said that rugby brought her to LIU, but the FBI was the long-term goal she had in mind. 
Long started playing rugby late in life. Having played her first year of rugby as a junior in high school, she said it wasn’t until October of her senior year that she actually began to think about pursuing a collegiate rugby career. However, even with coming in very late in the recruiting process, Long said she “made it work.” 
Looking towards the spring rugby season, the game format will switch to 7 vs. 7, leaving eight of the fall’s previous starters on the bench. “Not everyone’s gonna get to start now. So, I think a big thing for us is just continuing being a family and not let that divide come between us,” Long said. 
Academically, Long is currently undergoing the process of obtaining a summer internship with the FBI at either a location close to her home in Tennessee or at their home base in Quantico, V.A.
Looking toward the future, Sydney Long has big goals. In the short-term future, those goals include a successful spring season with the rugby team and a call back from the FBI.

Update – On Wednesday, Oct. 14 an additional 20 cases were reported on the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, bringing the total number of reported cases since Oct. 10 to 33.
Editor’s Note – The Pioneer chose to keep quotes given to us by athletes anonymous out of respect for their privacy.
At least 14 students have tested positive for COVID-19 due to off campus gatherings attended by several members of various athletic teams, according to an email from Chief of Student Affairs and Alumni Engagement Michael Berthel on Sunday, Oct. 11. 
The affected students and individuals who they were in close contact with are required to quarantine for two weeks. Anyone who is in a class with a student who tested positive has been notified, according to the email. The email also states that the university will be disinfecting all impacted areas, but does not specify what areas on campus have been affected.
The university shared the email with students and staff when they became aware that off campus gatherings had occurred, according to Berthel.
“The University immediately coordinated its response with the Department of Health. We are working in close cooperation with the Department of Health on contact tracing in accordance with their Contact Tracing Program, and notifying all students and faculty who are in classes with these individuals,” Berthel said. “Anyone who had been in contact with these students would have been notified by this point.”
The incident comes soon after the NEC announced winter athletics we’re supposed to start on time on Nov. 25.
On Saturday, Oct. 10, 11 positive cases were reported on the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, bringing the total number of reported cases for the two week from Sept. 27 to Oct. 10 to 19. On Sunday, Oct. 11 a new two week period that will last until Friday, Oct. 23 began, with a total of 13 positive cases being reported thus far. It is unclear how many cases are directly related to the gatherings.
All athletics have been paused for one week, and several athletic teams are currently quarantining as precautionary measures, according to Berthel.
One student athlete of a team not involved in this incident was upset because their practices have been cancelled for at least a week. 
“Everyone has been working super hard to be able to practice again, and because of a party it’s all on hold again,” they said. “None of us even heard of a party or anything and then next thing you know it’s shut down.”
The university currently has 85 students in quarantine, and 39 out of the available 50 quarantine rooms are currently in use, according to the New York State COVID-19 Report Card website.
Some athletes are afraid to speak out about the situation, fearing possible negative consequences.
“Athletes are being quiet about this incident in fear of negative repercussions from the athletic department,” one athlete said. “Although their information could be the difference between life and death to students with underlying health conditions.”
Disciplinary action against the students who attended the gatherings is being considered, according to Berthel. No details about what consequences may occur are known at the moment.
Some students, such as senior psychology major Nicole Ludwig, feel that the university needs to do a better job with enforcing social distancing guidelines on campus.
“The school needs to do more than send text messages and emails to enforce social distancing guidelines,” Ludwig said. “I’ve seen so many students walking around with their masks either below their noses or completely off without any consequences, and have even seen giant groups of friends eating together.”
In his email to the community, Berthel urged the student body to follow the university’s social distancing guidelines. 
“I understand that this pandemic has required sacrifice and you yearn for the social and emotional connection that has become synonymous with your LIU experience. We want that for you too,” the email stated. “However, the stakes are too high and we cannot take chances. Remain vigilant, renew your commitment to keeping yourself and our community safe, and act in a manner that demonstrates a genuine concern for your peers, your faculty, and your loved ones.”
Berthel would like to see the university have no new cases, which is something that can only be possible if students follow the universities COVID-19 guidelines.
“LIU will continue to respond immediately to positive cases when or if they occur. The positive test rate on campus is below county and state levels, but the university goal is to have zero cases,” he said. “All members of the LIU community are reminded to adhere very closely to LIU’s health guidelines: wear a face covering at all times when in public spaces on campus; practice physical distancing, do not gather in large groups; complete the daily health check-in; wash your hands regularly; stay home when you’re sick and seek immediate medical attention if you’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.”
Senior psychology major Sarah Ren, feels that while the university has done a good job regarding their COVID-19 protocols, the university’s dashboard does not provide enough information to keep the campus community informed. 
Ren would like to see the dashboard include the total number of cases the campus has experienced since the beginning of the semester. She feels that only showing positive cases from a two week period makes the situation appear less serious then it might otherwise be if the total number of cases were shown, and that students would be less likely to break social distancing guidelines if they had all of the information. 
Senior broadcasting major, Matthew Valentino thinks that the behavior displayed by some students is unfair to commuting students who have to put their families at risk.
“Now the students who commute and have to come on campus, but also be around their parents, or possibly grandparents, are putting themselves at risk, and everyone else around them at risk as well,” he said. “All because these kids want to have their college experience.”
Ludwig understands that the students who attended the parties most likely wanted to have a normal college experience, but thinks that what they did was reckless and dangerous.
“I think it’s very selfish to be trying to go to a party right now. I know so many people feel robbed of their college experience, and I can empathize with that, but your college experience isn’t going to mean as much to you if you find out someone you love has died from COVID,” she said. “And the longer we refuse to follow guidelines, the longer it’ll take for things to return to normal. To not follow the rules is to openly admit that you do not care about the safety of yourself or other people, and I don’t have any respect for that.”

With the NHL just over a month into its season, there have been quite a few surprises, growing expectations for teams and potential new audiences growing in the league. 
One of the biggest standouts so far this season in the NHL is the Buffalo Sabres. Last season, the Sabres traded away their franchise player Jack Eichel to the Las Vegas Golden Knights after contract disputes and disagreements over his surgically repaired neck rehabilitation. 
After this trade, the Sabres turned their focus to a full-on youth movement. Highlighted by their young stars in Owen Power, Jack Quinn and Casey Mittelstadt, the Sabres are currently defying all expectations, as they currently sit seventh in the Eastern Division, just behind the powerhouse teams in the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers. 
In addition to the Buffalo Sabres, another team that has stood out after a month of play is the Philadelphia Flyers. Under new head coach John Tortorella, the Flyers have come out with new energy and have been playing at a high level versus tough competition. Right now, the Flyers are fourth in the very tough Metropolitan Division and have been getting great production from Defenseman Tony DeAngelo, as he has two goals and six assists in 12 games.
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell spoke about these early season surprises from the Sabres and Flyers. 
“I’m definitely surprised by the Sabres and Flyers so far. I thought that the Sabres had potential, but I did not think they would be this good this quickly,” Campbell said. “I expected the Flyers to be awful, but they’re playing well so far. I’m sure that they’ll fall off at some point.” 
Highlighting the two New York hockey teams, the Islanders and Rangers both are off to great starts this season. Right now, the Rangers are fifth in the Metropolitan Division with 15 points, and the Islanders second in the division with 18 points in only 14 games played. 
The Rangers and Islanders are being led by their elite starting goaltending. Reigning Vezina award winner Igor Shesterkin is currently 6-2 with 2.58 goals allowed per game average. On the other side, Ilya Sorokin is 6-3 with 2.20 goals allowed per game. 
In addition, these two teams have some of the most explosive offenses in the league. The Rangers currently have one of the NHL’s top three performers in the month of October with Artemi Panarin, while the Islanders are scoring the sixth most goals per game with 3.6.
Even though the Rangers have a top three star of the month, graduate speech pathology student Ryan Branigan wants his favorite team to add a mega-star into the mix. 
“A trade rumor that’s been popular has been for Patrick Kane. I don’t know if that is the best move given what it would take to get him, but that move would obviously be an exciting one,” said Branigan.
Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks has been rumored as a New York Rangers trade candidate as his time in Chicago is starting to become clouded with a youth movement and contract issues beginning to bubble. With or without Kane, Branigan went on to mention how important this season is for the fans and supporters of the Rangers. 
“The Rangers’ expectations are at least to make the Stanley Cup, if not win it. Anything less than another deep playoff run will be looked at as a disappointment,” Branigan implored. 
Brady Campbell, a fan of the Islanders, also has high expectations for his favorite team. 
“Obviously, there were some things that were out of their control last year, but they were also not good. Most of the core is still here, and I definitely think this team should be a playoff team,” Campbell explained. “They are built for the playoffs, so once they get there, I think they could make a run, but the first important thing is to get back to the dance.” 
Though the NHL season is just beginning, hockey fever is starting to sweep over New York once again, with Stanley Cup dreams in sight.

Letter to the readers,
Not only is the season changing, there ís a new air on campus.  It’s not that fresh cool breeze that slips through your window screens at night either.  Students are a little rambunctious and more energetic than usual this week.  You might have even seen some familiar faces- former students or faculty (cough, cough alumni.)  The athletic teams, especially the football team, have more adrenaline pumping through their veins because this is just any weekend for Post.  It’s Homecoming weekend!!
This is the one weekend that current and past Postonians take the most pride in. Essentially it’s the one time of the year when the entire school really comes together.  Students gather at the pep rally on Friday night.  The residence halls compete for the best and most creative skit, athletic teams are introduced for the seasons, a DJ provides the music and suddenly you are caught up with the crowd that’s singing some song you don’t even know.  But you sure as hell are having a fun time!  Then Saturday comes and everyone watches the football game on Hickox field.  There’s tailgating in the Pratt parking lot, families of students come from all over the states, alumni return to play in athletic games or just to come and enjoy the day with their alma mater!
If you’re a freshmen, than you have to experience this for yourself.  Trust us, this is not an event to miss at Post.  But before we get too carried away, lets introduce the sixth edition of our student newspaper.  Many interesting articles this week; one focuses on the increase of tuition, while one of our editors discusses the two primary candidates for New York governor.  In sports, both the boys and girls cross-country teams traveled to sunny Florida and came back with a few record-breaking times.
As for our arts and entertainment section of Loomings, we are still looking for anyone interested in writing book, movie or game reviews.  Please email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.comÖdonít forget, we are still looking for that 50th email to give away that $500 prize!
From your staff of the Pioneer, Happy Homecoming and good luck Pioneers!

The C.W. Post Pioneers will not extend their season past this weekend. Post will not be involved in a PSAC Championship game. There will be no playoffs. And while the Pioneers outscored the Cheyney Wolves last week, the team may have proven why it won’t be in the postseason.
Cheyney is one of the worst teams in Division II. The team hasn’t had a winning season since 1979. Going back to 1995, the Wolves have a cumulative record of 8-161-1. Out of 151 Division II teams, the Wolves have the 134th offense. Any team should be able to stop their offense.
Go back to last week’s game. The Pioneers defeat the Wolves 63-28. Sure nine touchdowns on offense is a great stat but the defense gave up four. One of the problems with the Pioneers this year is the players’ demeanor on defense. There is no consistency from game to game. One week, the defense is all-world. The next, the squad surrenders points and puts the burden on the offense’s shoulders.
So many times this year, the Pioneers have given up easy yards. For the most part, they have been unable to stop their opponent’s rushing attack. This past week against one of the worst offenses in the nation, the Pioneers watched Cheyney run for 314 yards. Through 10 games, the Pioneers have given up 174 rushing yards per game.
Clearly that type of defense is not conducive of a playoff team. There have been so many instances this season where the defense should have or needed to come up big but fell short. As Coach Bryan Collins always points out to me, football has three phases. And while the offense has done well fighting through injuries, the special teams working through its own issues, the defense has not.
Regardless, there is room to grow for C.W. Post. The defense is full of young players. Donovan Edwards has started at cornerback as a true freshman. Sean Smith was having an excellent year before his knee injury and the vast majority of the starting defense will return next year.
But with one more game left against a solid slippery rock team, the Pioneers have an opportunity to reach seven wins and improve their record from last season. They’ll be in line to win as long as they can play a shutdown defense.

LIU Post was offered a special opportunity to display President Lincoln’s only surviving handwritten draft of the emancipation Proclamation in the Tilles Center of Performing Arts at the “First Step to Freedom: Abraham Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation” exhibit. The final version of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863, was destroyed in a fire in Chicago in 1871. The draft is the only remaining copy, which led to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom of slaves. The New York State Legislature purchased the draft in 1865 days after Lincoln passed away.
LIU Post is the only Long Island exhibitor of this rare document while it goes on a state-wide tour to mark the 150thanniversary of one of the nation’s greatest accomplishments. LIU Post and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts are pleased and honored to join with the New York State Education Department and SUNY College of Old Westbury in presenting these national treasures to the community,» said Dr. Paul Forestell. Along with Lincoln’s draft, a speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the centennial anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation is also on display next to the draft. 
Students who have seen the historical document expressed their admiration for it. “I think it’s great we we’re able to see a part of history in the Tilles Center,” says Mitch Mark, senior Psychology major. “It’s almost like reliving a part of history and it’s really special.” Matt Aronberg, an Information Studies graduate student says, “It’s amazing how a piece of paper was able to change so much of our history and to make our country the way it is now.”
At the opening ceremony held in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall during Common Hour, Dr. Forestell, Dr. Steinberg, Dr. John B. King, Jr., Andrew P. Jackson and Robert Tilles reminded visitors that freedom and equality hasn’t been reached yet. Robert Tilles explains to those in attendance the segregation on Long Island. “We have pockets of poverty. We drove along the road between the high and low performing [school] districts, and you see people across the street here look at people across the street there saying, ‘how come they get the best education and how come we get the worst education?’”
Both historical documents were on display for the public with free admission on October 15 and 16 from1 pm to 9 pm. The exhibit was offered in partnership with LIU Post, LIU Votes and the Tilles Center of Performing Arts.

As The Pioneer reported on Sept. 30, the LIU Post equestrian team set out to complete a daunting mission—raise enough money to rescue a slaughter- bound miniature horse, and make him the team mascot. The team held a bake sale during common hour in Hillwood Commons, posted flyers throughout campus seeking donations, and even created a web page on gofundme.com so that others could donate money to pay for the purchase and future expenses of the miniature horse.
After a lot of hard work and dedication, the girls were finally financially able to travel to the horse auction located in New Holland, Pennsylvania and choose which lucky horse would be coming home with them for another chance at life as their team mascot.
The mission took place on Oct. 13. Hope, a sweet palomino mare, caught the riders’ attention right away. Two of the three team captains, Cristina Bakos, a senior Speech Pathology/Pre-Med major, and Alex Diez, a junior Biology major, as well as one of the fundraisers, Christina Cepeda, a junior Psychology major, brought the mini horse to her new home in Bakos’ backyard barn in Nesconset, where she will have a much more exciting life with the other mini horses—and a donkey—already living there.
All of the money raised by the team will be put towards the many expenses needed to properly care for any horse, including veterinary and farrier appointments (hoof trimming), board, feed, wormer, shavings, and clothing. Hope had a warm welcome to the LIU Post equestrian team when she made her mascot debut at the annual Homecoming Football Game on Saturday, Oct. 18. For such a tiny equine, Hope handled the loud, crazy football game quite well. She tried her best to not get too overwhelmed.
“She was calm at homecoming, but would sometimes get startled with sudden, loud noises like popping balloons or the loud music, but eventually she got accustomed to the all the noise,” said team member Colleen Dreyer, a senior Public Relations major and the team’s Treasurer.
The day at homecoming was a success, which even included raising more money to care for Hope in the future. The equestrian team raised $1,110 through their “Go Fund Me” account, which is linked on the team’s Facebook page. To donate money to help Hope, you can go to www.gofundme.com/save- a-pony, or email christina.kotarski@my.liu.edu or christina.cepeda@my.liu.edu.
The next on-campus horse show at the North Shore Equestrian Center will be on Nov. 9, at 8 a.m. Hope, the mini mascot, will be there to show support. The event is open to the public.

To the Editors of the Pioneer:
On Wednesday, I posted a response to the excellent letter Editor Caroline Ryan published in the Pioneer. In my post, I expressed admiration for the clarity of her argument, and sadness that a student newspaper faces such deplorable conditions in trying to report campus news. This stance of complete message control on the part of the administration is antithetical to the concept of academic freedom and freedom of the press. It is demoralizing to the student journalists and heartbreaking for faculty members who work with them. It also makes our journalism program a hard sell to potential students who want the experience of working on a vital and relevant paper, not a University Public Relations mouthpiece, and discover that cannot happen here.
I am writing this letter as an addendum to my brief Facebook post (which seems to have disappeared) after learning that copies of this week’s Pioneer seem to have been removed from the campus before visitors to Homecoming and the Admissions Open House could grab them. This has happened before. It also happens at the Brooklyn Campus. It is shocking to see this go on in a campus community. I am appalled that our administration thinks this approach is somehow beneficial to our university, when in fact it does damage to all of us.

Two of the five deans of the schools and colleges on campus are interim, acting deans. One was appointed earlier this year and the other was appointed last week. Only one of the five deans has been in place for more than a year.
On Oct. 6, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane, sent a campus-wide email stating Dr. Albert Inserra, the former president of Dowling College, has been appointed dean of the college of education, information and technology. Inserra replaces Louisa Kramer-Vida, who was the acting dean of the college of education, information and technology.
Vida-Kramer is the chairperson of the department of special education as well as an assistant professor in the department. She was approached to take the position of acting dean in mid-June 2016, and began the position on Jul. 1. Kramer replaced Dr. Barbara Garii, the former dean of the college of education, information and technology, who became the vice president for academic affairs of St. Joseph’s College on Jul. 18.
As the Pioneer reported in its Oct. 5 issue, Jeffrey Belnap, the dean of LIU Global, has been appointed the acting dean of the college of liberal arts, succeeding chemistry Professor Nicholas Ramer, who was the acting dean of the college from June 2015 to August 2016. Ramer replaced former Dean Katherine Hill-Miller, who stepped down from the position in 2015 and returned to her position as a professor in the English department.
Art therapy professor, Christine Kerr, became the acting dean of the college of art, communications and design on Sept. 1, succeeding Noel Zahler, who left the University in August.
Stacey Gopack, who was the acting dean of the School of Health Professions last year, is the newly appointed permanent dean of that school.
Only Robert Valli, the dean of the College of Management, has been in his position since 2015.
Some students have expressed confusion and frustration about the coming and going of the deans. Senior economics major Marvin Johnson has had positive experiences with going to deans for help throughout his academic career. Johnson feels that with many of the deans stepping down and the administration constantly needing to find new replacements, many students may begin to feel lost. “Some students have a unique bond with certain deans and by them switching up and resigning, it just makes the students feel not wanted,” Johnson said. “It’s like a puppy with a new owner.”

What does it mean to be a woman? Where and when did the concept of womanhood come to life? The answers to these questions can be found on the stage in PTC’s production, “Age of Elizabeth.”
Follow modern Elizabeth and her mother’s story of betrayal and her journey through a timeline of mother-daughter relationships in past generations of her family, and the lessons that were passed down by each; discover how the trials women had faced in the past impact the future and define womanhood.
Written and directed by Logan DeWitt, the idea for “Age of Elizabeth” arose from a topic of discussion on nature vs. nurture within DeWitt’s household, where she is the only biological child of seven. DeWitt started to question learned behavior to search for the reasoning behind womanhood.
“I started writing it about a year ago,” DeWitt said. The script is still changing and transforming as the actors go through the workshop and rehearsal process.
The cast consists primarily of women: five Elizabeths, following the usually male tradition of passing down a name, and one man who plays every male character within the show.
DeWitt wanted to center the focus on the women of the play, as opposed to the men, an attempt to pass the Bechdel test. The test identifies the roles of female characters within a play or film based on three questions: whether they are named, interact with other female characters, and talk about anything other than a male character. In the entertainment industry today, many films fail that test. This pushed DeWitt to have a female-driven show.
“It’s really interesting being in this specific show,” said Cayla Michael, sophomore musical theatre major playing as modern Elizabeth. “There are a lot of things that she (Elizabeth) goes through that is personal to me and other people in my life.”
An overbearing and involved mother pressures Elizabeth, an issue that Michael sees reflected in some of her friends. “It gives me a sense of what they must have gone through,” she said.
With all of the focus on content and meaning throughout the play, the set itself is made to be simplistic in a fair contrast. Containing a single chair, three hanging frames to serve as time dividers, and walls on the sides covered in photos, the set establishes a place in time without drawing too much attention from the messages of the story.
What DeWitt wants is for the audience to examine the relationships they have in their own lives and what messages they are sending to one another through their interactions, especially for women. “Are we building one another up,” DeWitt asked, “Or are we subliminally tearing one another down?”
“Age of Elizabeth” will be showing at the Rifle Range Theater on Oct. 28-29 at 8 p.m. and Oct. 30 at 3 p.m.

In honor of Dr. Gerald Lachter, chairperson of the psychology department and a professor of psychology for more than 40 years at LIU Post, who passed away suddenly on Oct. 12, the ELIJA Foundation has started a scholarship fund in Lachter’s name.
The ELIJA Foundation is a nonprofit organization that helps families with autism and other behavioral disabilities. Lachter was involved with the organization.  “Gerry was excited for the advancement and promotion of behavior analysis on Long Island and was always the first to sign up to all the events we held,” according to ELIJA’s website. “Gerry never missed an ELIJA event. He was a dear friend and a wonderful colleague. He will be terribly missed.”
The Gerald Lachter Scholarship Fund will award one grant every year at the Long Island Behavior Analysis Conference in early December to an LIU Post or Queens College masters level or doctoral level student enrolled in a behavior analysis program, to help further his or her education in behavior analysis. The inaugural winner will be announced in December 2017 at the Annual Long Island Behavioral Analysis Conference. Individuals can fill out applications to apply for the fund starting on October 1, 2017.
Donations to the fund are tax-deductible. More information about ELIJA can be found at www.elija.org, info@elija.org or 516-216-5270.

On Friday, Oct. 13, the day before Homecoming, students were surprised to find 25 new yellow bicycles spread out across the campus, with multiple bikes chained to bike racks in front of Post Hall, Brookville Hall, the library, and between Nassau and Suffolk Halls.
Students received an email from President Kimberly Cline later that day, explaining that the new bikes had many uses, “whether it is rushing to your next class or squeezing in a quick workout.”
Students were expected to follow an “honor code,” according to the president’s email. Students were given the code “1954,” to unlock bike chains and to use the bikes at their own pleasure on campus, free of charge. Unfortunately, within days of their introduction to the campus, bikes were missing or damaged. Some bikes were hidden around campus, or taken into buildings and rooms to keep other students from being able to ride them. Another instance that occurred included the use of a personal lock to chain the campus bike.
Scott Carlin, the director of Center for Sustainability, is delighted that the administration offered on-campus bicycles to students.
Several years ago, students in the department of Earth and environmental science explored several alternative bicycle options for the campus. “Student research included working with third-party companies that manage and maintain the bicycles, [create] bicycle paths on the campus, and working to make sure that bicycles, pedestrians, and cars can share the campus safely,” Carlin said.
Carlin went on to say that it is not unusual for new bike programs to experience growing pains, and posed the same questions many students are asking. Should students be able to borrow bicycles anonymously or should they need an ID to borrow them? What happens with at tires and other maintenance issues? Who will be responsible?
Campus Life did not comment on the misconduct with bikes on campus. “We are excited to hear the initial feedback about the bike program. Students have been riding bikes around campus and we are happy that the program has been such a success,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said in an email. His email goes on to state, “As with any new program, we are constantly evaluating to determine future improvements and enhancements.
Students who have feedback regarding the program are encouraged to contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299-2800.”

In “Smite,” we are introduced to Ullr: The Glorious One. In the game, Ullr is designed in heavy robes and a hood, he also wears a bow and arrow and his twin axes. As a hunter god that lives in the frigid north, this design could not be more fitting.

There are many gods in Norse mythology, but few are as highly regarded as Ullr, “The Hunter God of Glory.” In both mythology and in “Smite,” Ullr doesn’t represent the boastfulness or shameful satisfaction one gets from seeing others fall. He is honorable and pays respect to true glory in all its forms.
For Ullr, glory is in the silence of snow fall, the perfect curve of a bow firing an arrow, the honorable victory earned in single combat and the moment of life’s rebirth. In Norse mythology, “The Hunter God of Glory” is an enigma ever keeping to himself. In “Smite,” Ullr is secretive and knows that true glory lies in remote hideaways, untouched by the hands of time, and it is in these very hideaways the shrines to Ullr can be found.
Ullr is highly respected even among the gods, for it his him and not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the all father is away. While other gods would abuse the power the throne brings, Ullr knows that his rule is an extension of Odin’s will.
The mythology states that Ullr is a skilled archer and an expert in close combat; this is no different in “Smite.” In the game, Ullr’s attacks and abilities revolve around his skills as a hunter. His passive ability is called weapons master; this allows Ullr to switch between fighting with his bow and his axes, and it is here that we see Ullr’s true skills. With his bow, Ullr’s abilities allow him to attack multiple
enemies at once while his axe-based abilities are for single combat.
Ullr’s second ability is called expose weakness. This allows Ullr to land critical hits easily. Just as his mythology counterpart finds glory in a bow firing an arrow true, Smite’s Ullr is able to find the perfect shot without hesitation.
Ullr’s ultimate is called Wield Axes; with this Ullr gains additional physical strength and lifesteal which allows him to deal more damage to a single enemy. This ties in to his mythology as it tells how Ullr finds honor in single combat and pays respect to his fallen foe.
While not much is known about Ullr, “Smite” does a good job of paying respect to his mythology and gives us a character that is both accurate and fun to play with.

Sammy Bell, junior psychology major, is a forward on the field hockey team, as well as the team’s leading scorer. During her time playing as a Shark for the fall 2019 season, Bell scored nine goals and 20 points throughout the 14 games the team played. 
Bell hails from Scotland and started playing field hockey there when she was seven years old. After playing field hockey in high school, Bell decided to attend college in America and chose LIU after Head Coach Raenee Savin got in contact with her. “Coach Savin reached out to me and I had never been to America before so I was very excited,” she said.
Bell played the previous two seasons with the Post Pioneers. As a freshman in 2017, she co-lead the team in assists, and along with 11 goals, she finished third on the team’s scoring list with 35 points. In 2018, Bell was second in all three categories with 16 goals, seven assists, and 39 points. 
Bell had a slow start to this season, but between Sunday, Oct. 13 and Friday, Oct. 25, she scored six goals in four games, including an overtime goal against Sacred Heart University, her second that day. Bell said the reason for her recent success is due to her team. “They have been hyping me up and playing better to win and want me to do well,” she said. Bell has also taken 62 out of the team’s 155 shots this season. She thanks senior midfielder and team captain Taylor Brodsky for that statistics. “Taylor is the reason I have many shots, as she is able to set me up for good scoring opportunities,” she said.  
Brodsky predicts Bell will have a big impact in the upcoming games. “She’s a big part of our team and we rely on her a lot,” she said. Bell is a great player with a humble attitude, but she needs pushing from her captain, according to Brodsky. “She needs to be pushed a lot but she is a very humble player and it’s been an honor to play with such a good field hockey player, and especially to be the person that pushes her every day,” she said.     
Junior goalkeeper Rachel Vellis is one of Bell’s close friends and said that she loves to see her score. “She is my best friend and gets me really hyped up. It gets me excited when I hear the echo from the other side of the field,” Vellis said. She also said that Bell is a strong presence on the field and brings a lot of energy.  
Coach Savin has coached Bell for three years and said she has seen her develop from a freshman who wasn’t prepared for the amount of conditioning collegiate field hockey requires, to one of the team’s most valuable players. “The summer after her freshman year, she made a huge adjustment, which helped prepare her for the great season that she had last year,” Savin said. “Sammy has been a huge asset for our team and we need her to keep putting the ball in the back of the net because very often we come out on top when she’s scoring.”  
Going forward, Bell and the field hockey team play their last games of the regular season on Friday, Nov. 1, against Fairfield University and on Sunday, Nov. 3, against Temple University. The Sharks will then prepare for the NEC Tournament since the team secured a spot in the playoffs with a 1-0 win over Bryant University on Sunday Oct. 27. They are the first Shark team of the new Division I program to claim a playoff berth. The NEC championship tournament is being hosted in Staten Island at Wagner University on Friday, Nov. 8 and Sunday, Nov. 10.

With the ongoing issue of Covid-19, everything from sports programs to theatre groups have had to make adjustments in order to ensure students’ safety. One such group is the Wind Ensemble, who have faced special challenges in resuming their rehearsals as students have returned to campus. 
The students and faculty of Wind Ensemble are no strangers to needing to adapt when it comes to the coronavirus, after dealing extensively with this issue last spring when campus was shut down. “Due to Zoom’s latency, it is impossible to play in time with each other” explained instrument performance music major (clarinet), Jacklyn Smith. “Instead, we spent the rest of the spring semester working on special projects,” said Smith. 
Professor McRoy, director of Wind Ensemble ensured the group was still able to make the most out of virtual learning. “We did a variety of different things,” said McRoy, “at the time we were working with a lot of music by composer Brian Balmages – preparing for our annual Band Festival when he would have been with us. In March-April, we did a deep dive on some of that music and did some analysis and other exploration.” 
In spite of their successful handling of the remote spring semester, students and faculty alike were grateful to be returning to in-person rehearsals. “After not having in-person rehearsals since early March, coming back to that environment is something I’ve really been looking forward to throughout these past few months” said Smith. This semester however, rehearsals will function differently than they ever have before, in order to ensure the group’s safety.
“We rehearse all spread out, six-plus feet apart…Percussionists wear gloves….Everyone has to use their own music stand. I wear a headset wireless mic broadcast through a speaker so everyone can hear me through my mask,” explained McRoy. 
Wind Ensemble has also had to deal with the added challenge of having woodwind and brass players, whose instruments require air flow in order to be played. Smith spoke about how these instrumentalists have found ways to play their instruments in a safe manner: “We made masks with a slit (so the mouthpiece fits through), and bell covers to further decrease the risk of contamination.”
 Even with masks, social distancing, gloves, and coverings on their instruments, Wind Ensemble has taken additional precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in their rehearsal space. “We rehearse for a period of time, then take a break for the air in our rehearsal hall to clean and change, then we return to continue to rehearse…There was a lot of scientific research done over the summer at the University of Colorado that we learned from on how to continue to make music in this environment,” explained McRoy, “It’s different, but it’s working.”
Now, the group is looking forward to what lays ahead for the remainder of the semester, including some virtual performances and events. “Right now, my plan is to record a performance in our rehearsal hall toward the middle of November – before Thanksgiving. We will then broadcast that via Zoom at a later date along with some interviews of students and perhaps some of the composers whose music we are preparing” said McRoy. This foresight and hardwork Professor McRoy has been putting into the group has not gone unappreciated by the students in the ensemble “[He] has worked extremely hard to ensure we have a wonderful and safe semester” said Smith.
With a successful method of holding safe rehearsals in place and some virtual events on the horizon, Wind Ensemble is excited for the rest of their semester of making music together, even if it’s done from six feet apart. “In rehearsal we talk openly about how great it is to be together doing what we love, and we also share openly what a challenge it is to do that in this environment. The key is to embrace it and not fight it. Turn every challenge into an opportunity to learn and grow” said McRoy.

Colder weather on campus means that items like blankets are a must. The Long Island University Field Hockey team is selling blankets available for purchase. The blankets are $60 each and found  on their Instagram page @liufieldhockey. 
Field Hockey Head Coach Raenee Savin says that she got the inspiration for the blankets from a recruiting trip a few years ago. “I was recruiting at a high school field hockey playoff game in late November, and as I stood there freezing, all the fans in the stands were wrapped in their warm blankets, all matching and supporting their team,” she said. “Right after that, I placed our first order! It was perfect timing, as our field hockey team played into December for the NCAA finals.” 
This is not the first year the blankets have been for sale and the blankets have evolved with the school. “We started selling these blankets in the C.W. Post Pioneers generation of LIU. Sales continued as we kept the green and gold,” Coach Savin said. 
Coach Savin is confident the tradition of these blanket sales throughout the colder months of the year have been a success. “Still now, as we transitioned to the blue and gold, LIU Sharks blankets are keeping fans warm in the stands,”she said. “Eight years later, we continue to sell,and get excited with each sale, knowing that our customers are always happy with their purchase!”
While @liufieldhockey recently posted about the blankets, Savin says that anyone can buy the blankets at any time. “There is no end date. We just had a surge in blanket sales and placed another order, but we always have them available for purchase,” she said. 
Additionally, anyone can buy these blankets with shipping or pickup.“For a small additional fee, we are able to ship your blanket.  We also provide contactless pickup on campus,” Savin said. 
Savin encourages everyone to buy a blanket for their practicality and ties to campus. “These blankets are meant for everyone, not just sports fanatics! I keep one on my car and one on my couch. I use it when I travel,” she said  “These blankets wash easily, are super comfortable and are a great way to show off your Shark spirit, great for incoming freshmen or graduating seniors, a blanket in the dorm or even for an alum as a reminder of your years at LIU,”
You can email raenee.savin@liu.edu or brittany.robertson@liu.edu to purchase.

Letter to the readers,
Not only is the season changing, there ís a new air on campus.  It’s not that fresh cool breeze that slips through your window screens at night either.  Students are a little rambunctious and more energetic than usual this week.  You might have even seen some familiar faces- former students or faculty (cough, cough alumni.)  The athletic teams, especially the football team, have more adrenaline pumping through their veins because this is just any weekend for Post.  It’s Homecoming weekend!!
This is the one weekend that current and past Postonians take the most pride in. Essentially it’s the one time of the year when the entire school really comes together.  Students gather at the pep rally on Friday night.  The residence halls compete for the best and most creative skit, athletic teams are introduced for the seasons, a DJ provides the music and suddenly you are caught up with the crowd that’s singing some song you don’t even know.  But you sure as hell are having a fun time!  Then Saturday comes and everyone watches the football game on Hickox field.  There’s tailgating in the Pratt parking lot, families of students come from all over the states, alumni return to play in athletic games or just to come and enjoy the day with their alma mater!
If you’re a freshmen, than you have to experience this for yourself.  Trust us, this is not an event to miss at Post.  But before we get too carried away, lets introduce the sixth edition of our student newspaper.  Many interesting articles this week; one focuses on the increase of tuition, while one of our editors discusses the two primary candidates for New York governor.  In sports, both the boys and girls cross-country teams traveled to sunny Florida and came back with a few record-breaking times.
As for our arts and entertainment section of Loomings, we are still looking for anyone interested in writing book, movie or game reviews.  Please email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.comÖdonít forget, we are still looking for that 50th email to give away that $500 prize!
From your staff of the Pioneer, Happy Homecoming and good luck Pioneers!

1. It would be cool if you guys can take pictures ofr random students around campus. I know  I would feel good seeing myself in the paperhave a good feeling to see myself in a paper. It creates some sort of a celeb/student status – . kinda like  make an on campus gossip section. I don’t know, it’s just an idea. The 1st edition was great, like all the rest and near future printed papers. Real professional!

2. Hi Pioneer staff,
If I could change things I’d have articles based more on world news, not just issues that effect the average frat boy. Many students aren’t aware of activities on campus, so doing articles on those clubs might be a good idea at the beginning of the year. However, more detailed articles on our government and current events would be great. Also, while I feel like it’s important that the arts section be expanded and worked upon, the combination of Loomings and the paper is a poor choice. The magazine was beautiful and the picture quality suffers when artwork is printed on newsprint. There is also even less attention on the arts on campus now that there is no publication. It’s too bad that Loomings is understaffed.
Thanks.
Sincerely,
E. Amaral

5. To “The Pioneer”,
Hello. Recently I read the first the first issue of The Pioneer and saw the ad in the back about “what you’d like to see”; so here I go! I am a currently enrolled Art student at the C.W. Post campus. I would love to do a comic strip per issue of the newspaper on campus life, commuter life and general college life. I think readers would really enjoy “seeing” this in their campus paper. I plan on making it some-what humorous and personal to the school. Please let me know if this is a possibility and I will send some comic strip ideas. Also, if there is ever any need for illustrations or photographs I would love to get involved with that too. 
Thank you for your time!

however, i had a change to be interviewed during the chuseok story.
It was the first time to be in an article and i was so happy with my friends hahaha and we all laughed at my picture.
As an international student, it is easier to read the Pioneer because it is easy to relate to in comparison to the new york times.
In addition, if the Pioneer will add articles about the International students, a lot of them will pay attention! at least I hope so!

The C.W. Post Pioneers will not extend their season past this weekend. Post will not be involved in a PSAC Championship game. There will be no playoffs. And while the Pioneers outscored the Cheyney Wolves last week, the team may have proven why it won’t be in the postseason.
Cheyney is one of the worst teams in Division II. The team hasn’t had a winning season since 1979. Going back to 1995, the Wolves have a cumulative record of 8-161-1. Out of 151 Division II teams, the Wolves have the 134th offense. Any team should be able to stop their offense.
Go back to last week’s game. The Pioneers defeat the Wolves 63-28. Sure nine touchdowns on offense is a great stat but the defense gave up four. One of the problems with the Pioneers this year is the players’ demeanor on defense. There is no consistency from game to game. One week, the defense is all-world. The next, the squad surrenders points and puts the burden on the offense’s shoulders.
So many times this year, the Pioneers have given up easy yards. For the most part, they have been unable to stop their opponent’s rushing attack. This past week against one of the worst offenses in the nation, the Pioneers watched Cheyney run for 314 yards. Through 10 games, the Pioneers have given up 174 rushing yards per game.
Clearly that type of defense is not conducive of a playoff team. There have been so many instances this season where the defense should have or needed to come up big but fell short. As Coach Bryan Collins always points out to me, football has three phases. And while the offense has done well fighting through injuries, the special teams working through its own issues, the defense has not.
Regardless, there is room to grow for C.W. Post. The defense is full of young players. Donovan Edwards has started at cornerback as a true freshman. Sean Smith was having an excellent year before his knee injury and the vast majority of the starting defense will return next year.
But with one more game left against a solid slippery rock team, the Pioneers have an opportunity to reach seven wins and improve their record from last season. They’ll be in line to win as long as they can play a shutdown defense.

C.W. Post students were able to express their Post pride with a Pep Rally on Friday, October 21st, at 7 p.m. in the gym of the Pratt Recreation Center. Sponsored by The Association for Campus Planning (ACP), the Pep Rally had a number of events for students to enjoy.
The night included the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners of the talent show giving an encore of their winning performances. Homecoming banners were proudly displayed, clubs were acknowledged, and the Student Dance Association and Pioneerettes dazzled the crowd with their own performances. And, last but not least, students showed their Post pride to the football team before the big homecoming game. What’s not to love about pep rally?
In addition to the performances, there were also free food and drinks offered to the crowd, along with some green and gold pompoms and foam fingers to cheer with. And, ACP didn’t stop there. It also threw free C.W. Post t-shirts into the crowd and had a D.J. blasting music throughout the event to keep the students pumped up.
Sally-Ann Gaughan, a junior early childhood education major, was surprised by this year’s pep rally. “It was better than I thought it would be. It had more school spirit. It was just awesome.”
Anna Smith, a freshman with an undeclared major, also enjoyed pep rally, saying, “I liked it and thought it was really good. The music was also really good, too.”
This year’s Pep Rally did just what it set out to do: get students pumped up for the big Homecoming game, and allow them to let loose and have some fun.

LIU Post was offered a special opportunity to display President Lincoln’s only surviving handwritten draft of the emancipation Proclamation in the Tilles Center of Performing Arts at the “First Step to Freedom: Abraham Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation” exhibit. The final version of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863, was destroyed in a fire in Chicago in 1871. The draft is the only remaining copy, which led to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom of slaves. The New York State Legislature purchased the draft in 1865 days after Lincoln passed away.
LIU Post is the only Long Island exhibitor of this rare document while it goes on a state-wide tour to mark the 150thanniversary of one of the nation’s greatest accomplishments. LIU Post and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts are pleased and honored to join with the New York State Education Department and SUNY College of Old Westbury in presenting these national treasures to the community,» said Dr. Paul Forestell. Along with Lincoln’s draft, a speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the centennial anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation is also on display next to the draft. 
Students who have seen the historical document expressed their admiration for it. “I think it’s great we we’re able to see a part of history in the Tilles Center,” says Mitch Mark, senior Psychology major. “It’s almost like reliving a part of history and it’s really special.” Matt Aronberg, an Information Studies graduate student says, “It’s amazing how a piece of paper was able to change so much of our history and to make our country the way it is now.”
At the opening ceremony held in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall during Common Hour, Dr. Forestell, Dr. Steinberg, Dr. John B. King, Jr., Andrew P. Jackson and Robert Tilles reminded visitors that freedom and equality hasn’t been reached yet. Robert Tilles explains to those in attendance the segregation on Long Island. “We have pockets of poverty. We drove along the road between the high and low performing [school] districts, and you see people across the street here look at people across the street there saying, ‘how come they get the best education and how come we get the worst education?’”
Both historical documents were on display for the public with free admission on October 15 and 16 from1 pm to 9 pm. The exhibit was offered in partnership with LIU Post, LIU Votes and the Tilles Center of Performing Arts.

After 13 months of campaigning, rallying, and debating, Barack Obama will begin his second term in the White House. Although he beat former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in a landslide in electoral votes, he was not as popular amongst all Americans.
According to A CNN article published this month, “Obama takes key battlegrounds to win re-election” by Tom Cohen, Obama won all battleground states as well as Romney’s birthplace of Michigan and his governing state of Massachusetts, with 332 electoral votes. Romney won 206 electoral votes.  Obama needed only 270 electoral votes to win the election. But, Obama did not win the popular vote with such a wide margin. According to the BBC U.S. 2012 results, 50.5 percent of the country voted for Obama while 47.9 voted for Romney, leaving the nation divided.
In Chicago, Obama supporters roared and cheered once Obama’s victory was announced, while television networks showed coverage of Romney supporters somber and crying. Republicans still had hope since Fox News Analyst Karl Rove had reported that Romney might still have a chance in winning Ohio. Shortly after Obama won the battleground state. After Romney’s concession speech, one Romney supporter stated that the fact that Romney lost was “a tough pill to swallow.”
A new Romney appeared on stage, less aggressive and more somber than we’ve seen him in the past months. An hour after news networks projected Barack Obama as victor, in Boston, Romney, whose eyes appeared to be red and watery, conceded, “I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation. The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing. I believe in America, I believe in the people of America.”
In Barack Obama’s acceptance speech, he stated, “Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs – not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together…..We’ve got more work to do.”
Changes promised for students under Obama’s Presidency:
Student debt has reached $1 trillion for the fist time in history. Students will begin to see Obama’s Pay as You Earn program reiterated on certain websites where students can apply for loans. The Pay as You Earn program, which will be in effect in 2013-2014, caps monthly federal student loan repayment at 10 percent of one’s monthly income. This is so students have more money to spend and invest in the economy, according to Barackobama.com. Also, under this program, a student can choose the college they want to attend based on their career goals and not solely on the price of tuition. In addition, if one pays their federal loans on time and at least at 10 percent of your monthly income as a teacher, service person, or doctor, one will be forgiven of federal loans after 10 years. For all other professions, if loans are paid responsibly, one will be forgiven in 20 years.
The Know Before You Owe program is a form that includes loan interest rates while differentiating between grants and scholarships, showing students exactly what they will be paying, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the U.S. Department of Education. The form would also be introduced as a universal Financial Aid document that all colleges would be urged to adopt by the 2013-14 school year. This would allow students to see what they are being offered and how much they could possibly pay, before they accept the offer to attend that school. President Obama also insured that veterans and service members would be able to get a college education and find work when they return from service by implementing and expanded the post-9/11 G.I. Bill, according to BarackObama.com.
He also proposes to make higher education institutions more affordable, even though a written bill has yet to be written out and plans lack details, according to “With Obama’s Win, Colleges Anticipate 4 More Years of Reform,” by Michael Stratford in Chronicle.com this month. According to WhiteHouse.gov, the official website of the White House, Obama stated, “Higher education is not a luxury. Earning a postsecondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs.”
The President will be inaugurated for his second term on January 21, 2013 in Washington D.C.

LIU Post’s Association for Campus Programming (ACP) had students hyped and anxious for Saturday’s homecoming with a week full of exciting events. Homecoming is a week dedicated to welcoming back alumni and also a time for current students to have fun, socialize, and partake in school pride. The week is very important to Post students for many reasons, and this year’s homecoming proved to be a success.
Jeremiah Aviles, sophomore Childhood Education major, said, “Homecoming is the core of LIU Post because it’s the anticipation of a crazy weekend.”
Main Events
Some of the main events were the pep rally, the homecoming carnival, the homecoming party, and the biggest event of the week was the homecoming football game.
The pep rally was held in the Pratt Center on Friday, Oct. 18. It was an enjoyable time for students to demonstrate Post pride and kick off the weekend. The pep rally consisted of performances by the Post dance team, cheerleaders, residence halls, and DJ S. Whit. The rally was also used to introduce LIU’s soccer, volleyball, swim, and football teams.
There was free food and Post giveaways for all guests. The Pratt was packed and the atmosphere was electric.
Alfred Cabera, sophomore Business Management major, believes that homecoming is the most popular school event throughout the year. “It’s the biggest social event of the year. Everyone participates in homecoming, even people from other schools,” said Cabera. “It’s a chance to meet your peers in a different environment.”
The Homecoming Carnival was a magnificent experience for students, families, and guests. The carnival was held in the Pratt and at Hickox Field at noon on Saturday and continued until 4 p.m.
Admission for the carnival was $15 and included a ticket to the football game and a barbeque lunch. There were rides, games, and club tables with promotions and activities.
Student Thoughts
Jesus Cardenas, senior Business and Film major, has always been excited and anxious for homecoming. “Homecoming has always been a time to take a step back from work and have fun with new and old friends,” he said.
“I’m excited about this year because Post is in a remodeling stage and we can make this the biggest homecoming and start new traditions with a new name,” he added.
The Homecoming Party is an annual celebration held on Saturday night for all LIU Post students and their guests to enjoy. The party has usually been held in the basement of Winnick, but this year it was moved to the Pratt Recreation Center to allow room for a greater audience.
Admission to the party was $5 for students and $10 for guests. Student Life, ACP, and a combination of student clubs and organizations hosted the party. The festivities were well attended and the venue was decorated with LIU Post colors and flashing lights.
Teresa Lisbet Ndong, sophomore International Business major, believes that this year’s homecoming was better than last year’s. “There were more fun activities this year, people seem friendlier, and everyone was having a great time together.”
Football Victory
The most important event of all is the homecoming football game. It’s the most anticipated event of the week, and the most popular. The LIU Post football team the Pioneers brought their “A-game” with them as they shutout Pace University in a 58-0 victory.
“I knew we were going to win, we were focused and ready to demolish Pace,” said Matthew Ferere, a sophomore defensive back for the Pioneers.
Homecoming 2013 was a great weekend for Post students to relax, have fun, and take a break from schoolwork just for a little bit. Most students enjoyed themselves and the Pioneer’s victory helped boost everybody’s energy.

Over the past couple of semesters, more and more students have been attracted to Hicksville for off-campus housing, causing an everyday struggle for students to board the free shuttle, which has a 25 person occupancy limit, to school in the mornings. As a result, the Office of Campus Life and the Student Government Association have worked together to improve transportation—and more options are underway.
Students, faculty, and staff are taking advantage of the shuttle services, and the same hours seem to appeal to them all. “9.00 a.m. is by far the busiest time,” said Ian Jonson, a freshman undeclared major who lives in the Hicksville area. “I’ve been at the bus stop 20 minutes before the shuttle is supposed to leave, and you could tell straight away it wasn’t enough.”
The excessive demand for the crowded morning shuttle buses leaves students with two options: to go hard or to go home. “Lines have been non-exist[ent], and those getting a spot on the bus have usually been those with the sharpest elbows,” Jonson said. Instead of taking the risk, Jonson and his housemates have given up the extra hour of sleep, and are taking the 8 a.m. shuttle instead to make sure they don’t miss class.
Recently, the Office of Campus Life and SGA have studied the issue, and together worked on changes to the shuttles. “Along with the SGA, we constantly monitor the transportation needs of our students and make changes accordingly,” said Abagail Van Vlerah, Dean of Students.
“Van Vlerah and I actually rode [the shuttle] last week sometime in the afternoon, to get feedback from students,” Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, added.
The changes already in place have not increased the amount of rides to and from Hicksville; the latest round that used to leave campus at 9 p.m. has been taken away, and the shuttle is now going at 1 p.m. instead, breaking the previous almost six-hour break the shuttle used to have between 10:20 a.m. and 4 p.m.
“It is an expensive and year-round service, so we have tried to play around with the schedule before increasing any costs,” Berthel said. “SGA has allocated over $100,000 for the student shuttle service during the 2014-2015 academic year,” he added.
For those who dorm and don’t own a car, the off-campus shuttles to Hicksville and Pathmark in Greenvale have been the only free alternatives to leave the campus. “During weekdays, I try not to take the shuttle after its break in the afternoon because I know it will be completely full of commuters,” said Tine Markar Lolland, a junior Public Relations major. Lolland explained that the weekends are the only times she does not have any problems.
To facilitate leaving campus for on- campus students, the university will launch a new Zipcar program on Wednesday, Oct. 22, which will allow students to use an on-campus rental car all hours.
The Zipcar project is a global car- sharing network with operations at other college campuses throughout the U.S. Any student over 18, faculty over 21, or community member who has been a licensed driver for a minimum of one year (international licenses accepted) can apply. After registering online, and paying the annual membership fee ($25 for first year), students can reserve a car at any time of the day. Over the first month, students will be discounted for their first $35 driving dollars, according to William Achnitz, Campus Life Coordinator and Sustainability Coordinator. The rental will take place outside of Post Hall.
Jonson believes it is only fair to give the residents another option to leave campus; however, he wants to see some action taken on the free Hicksville shuttle, as well. “The shuttle is a service offered by the school, and you can’t offer services unless you can guarantee all those wishing to utilize it will be able to.”
Berthel stated that he understands where the frustration with the shuttle service comes from. “Students definitely have reasons to complain,” he said.
“The services are paid for by university and student funds, ultimately coming from student activity fees.”
SGA and Campus Life are considering further changes to the shuttle service that may affect the university wallet moving forward. “We are looking into a bigger bus,” Berthel said. “We are also thinking about moving the bus stop from the Chapel to the Humanities area where most departments are located; this way, students will get dropped off closer to the classrooms.”
However, Berthel warned students not to expect major changes any time soon. “Be patient. It is not going to happen overnight.”

People might think that Greek life is all about the parties, cliques, and frat houses, because movies portray them that way. However, this isn’t the movies, this is LIU Post. At this university, there are no fraternity houses or cliques, but Greek life is a “community of students who are initiated into one of our recognized fraternities or sororities,” said Katherine Wieme, Director of Greek Life & Student Involvement, a position in Campus Life.
Wieme explained that it offers students opportunities to bond, strengthen leadership qualities, and network with alumni. There are 11 fraternities and sororities on campus: Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Delta Zeta, Phi Sigma Kappa, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and Chi Nu Alpha.
“We currently have over 250 students in fraternities and sororities,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life. “We are proud to now be home to some of the largest national organizations in the world and are excited to add Sigma Delta Tau to our community in the spring
[2016].”These organizations are not all the same; they have different recruitment processes, structures, and types of councils. The three types of councils are the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Association, or the Multicultural Council. Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Phi Epsilon, and Delta Zeta are Panhellenic sororities. Tau Kappa Epsilon, Phi Sigma Kappa, Theta Chi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon are fraternities a part of the Interfraternity Council. Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Tau, and Chi Nu Alpha, are the fraternities and sororities that belong to the Multicultural Council.
“Being in a cultural organization differs from other organizations because we’re very passionate about our organization’s history and the meaning behind the letters; we take pride in the roots of where we come from,” said Richard Batista, President of Phi Iota Alpha, and a senior adolescence education major in mathematics. Batista also explains that one thing you learn is that you should “never forget who you are and where you come from.”
Each fraternity and sorority has a philanthropy that they partner with. “In DZ [Delta Zeta], we raise money and awareness for our philanthropy Speech and Hearing, to try to make a difference in other people’s lives,” said Nicole Cunningham, President of DZ and graduate literacy education major. Their philanthropy focuses on those that are affected by speech and hearing challenges.
“Engaging in community service projects and raising funds and awareness for various philanthropic organizations are fundamental components of being an active member of a Greek organization,” said Alexa Regina, President of Alpha Phi Epsilon, and a senior social work major. She mentions that AEPHI “values service, which has allowed me to give back to the community with the help of my
sisters.”It can be hard to find your place in college. Now that doesn’t mean your clique or “it” group, but a group of people that help you find yourself and enjoy your college and life experience. Greek life can help “students to find their home in a fraternity or sorority,” Wieme said.
“Joining Greek life is so important because when you join your org, you are also joining a community,” said Giovanna Domingo, Financial VP of Alpha Xi Delta, and sophomore accounting major. “Over the last year I have seen such a positive change in Greek life. Even if you don’t know a person and you’re wearing letters, you always have something to talk about because there is that common thread.” She explained that more people have joined, which has shown such a positive growth.
These organizations have made an impact on many students and the campus itself. “Joining Greek life has without a doubt been one of the best decisions I’ve made in college. It’s gotten me way more involved than I ever was before on campus and it’s equipped me with invaluable leadership opportunities,” said Jawaan Smith, VP of Phi Sigma Kappa, a senior arts management major. “Also, knowing you have 20 plus guys who always have your back and are there for you through your highs and lows is a great feeling. It’s definitely a rewarding experience.”
“We are proud that our Greek Life students are also active in student organizations, residence halls, athletic teams, and student run businesses,” Wieme said.
“Being in Greek life means being involved, but still the most important job is for you to be a student. The hardest part about Greek Life is time management,” according to Michael Aquilano, Programing Director of Phi Sigma Kappa and sophomore psychology major.
“When you join Greek Life, you become a part of something that is very active and you need to learn or already have time management skills. Especially if you want to hold and E-board or chair position,” he said.
Wieme explained that the Office of Campus Life serves as the primary advisor to Greek life, including all the governing councils, organizations, and individual members and that they support the growth of these organizations. Campus Life “maintains a Greek life expansion policy for any organization who is interested in becoming recognized on campus,” she said.
“All of our organizations are national with chapters across the country,” Wieme said. “Post students who join a fraternity or sorority will have the opportunity to attend conventions, network with alumni, and meet fellow members from other institutions.”
Berthel added that Campus Life, and the university fully support the fraternities and sororities. “Providing opportunities for students to take part in Greek life is very important to us and we will continue to look
for ways to grow and strengthen our current organizations and add new organizations,” he said. If you think Greek life is for you: go out and meet the different organizations during Greek week or Greek events, which are held every semester and maybe you’ll find your new home.

How many “selfies” does it take to settle on the “perfect” picture? How many times have you posted a “fire” picture onto social media, but your peers didn’t reciprocate (like the photo), so you deleted it? Although the players remain the same, the games and the rules of which the players play by, have changed ten-fold.
Once upon a time, well, really before all of these social media sites, we would look at each other on the Starbucks line, and make our judgments from there. However, “We now look at the person’s Instagram first, make our first judgment, and then we take it from there,” said senior history major, Kathy Rice. “I can name 1,000 times where some guy would like [my posts] on Instagram, I guess showing interest in
me, but then in person, no social contact, none whatsoever,” she added.
When Rice told me this story, I literally, “loled,” but this really is no laughing matter.
Let’s me ask you again, why does it take 200 pictures to get that one perfect selfie?! To be honest, folks, I think I have that answer. The mini photo shoot we partake in when we want to post a picture on social media is caused by something I would like to call, “Social Perfection,” a.k.a delusion.
I believe that social media is driving our youth to the brink of insanity as it causes them to feel the need to to “qualify” within their respective social groups. For example, Marcella Anteri, a Suffolk County High School physics teacher, recalled a story about one of her students and social media.
“One of my juniors, who will remain nameless, came to me at the end of class,” said Anteri. “That class, she did none of her physics homework, and totally bombed my quiz. She came to me, and before she could say anything, tears began pouring from her face.”
Anteri later revealed that her student’s disarray stemmed from her fear that she was being judged off of her social media posts. According to Anteri, her student told her, “I accidentally liked my friend’s ex-boyfriend’s picture, and they’ve been ignoring me all week.”
We all know being in high school can come with its times of social hardship to say the least, but if you think about it, social media just adds to that fire we deal with in our adolescent years. In the age of social media and texting, misinterpretation and cyberbullying have run rampant. It has led Mike Kurtz, a junior education major, across the street at NYIT to stop texting all together.
“You really wouldn’t believe how many fights [with friends] I’ve gotten into because I didn’t answer a text within three minutes, or reply ‘lol’ instead of replying ‘lmfao,’” Kurtz said. “I remember one time where a girl I was dating told me a joke, at which I replied [over text], ‘lol.’ She later texted saying, ‘I haven’t liked your attitude all day and that last text proves you’re giving me one right now.’”
“I never texted her back after that, because I knew where it was going to go,” said Kurtz. “If I have something to say, or want to talk to you then I’m just going to call you. I’m bringing back the phone call!”
Social media to me is a synthetic form of human interaction; a form of interaction, which in most cases that does us more harm than good. Yes, social media links us beyond the classroom and to each corner of the Earth; however, Instagram, Twitter, even Facebook, and Snapchat, have become portfolios, or as I’d like to call them, “baseball cards” to track our latest social undertakings, misleadingly presenting them to our peers.
Posting a picture of your lavish vacations, the new car, your selfie, taken from an angle that probably led you to sprain your wrist and shoulder, and not to mention your “following to followers ratio.” Social Media allows us to portray ourselves in our “best” light, and that’s great! What if social media just further enhances the saying “perception is reality,” in a world where everyone’s perception of each other is derived of social media. It makes me wonder if we are losing our authenticity, and that’s kind of scary. Well, too scary to me at least.

To the Editors of the Pioneer:
On Wednesday, I posted a response to the excellent letter Editor Caroline Ryan published in the Pioneer. In my post, I expressed admiration for the clarity of her argument, and sadness that a student newspaper faces such deplorable conditions in trying to report campus news. This stance of complete message control on the part of the administration is antithetical to the concept of academic freedom and freedom of the press. It is demoralizing to the student journalists and heartbreaking for faculty members who work with them. It also makes our journalism program a hard sell to potential students who want the experience of working on a vital and relevant paper, not a University Public Relations mouthpiece, and discover that cannot happen here.
I am writing this letter as an addendum to my brief Facebook post (which seems to have disappeared) after learning that copies of this week’s Pioneer seem to have been removed from the campus before visitors to Homecoming and the Admissions Open House could grab them. This has happened before. It also happens at the Brooklyn Campus. It is shocking to see this go on in a campus community. I am appalled that our administration thinks this approach is somehow beneficial to our university, when in fact it does damage to all of us.

Two of the five deans of the schools and colleges on campus are interim, acting deans. One was appointed earlier this year and the other was appointed last week. Only one of the five deans has been in place for more than a year.
On Oct. 6, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane, sent a campus-wide email stating Dr. Albert Inserra, the former president of Dowling College, has been appointed dean of the college of education, information and technology. Inserra replaces Louisa Kramer-Vida, who was the acting dean of the college of education, information and technology.
Vida-Kramer is the chairperson of the department of special education as well as an assistant professor in the department. She was approached to take the position of acting dean in mid-June 2016, and began the position on Jul. 1. Kramer replaced Dr. Barbara Garii, the former dean of the college of education, information and technology, who became the vice president for academic affairs of St. Joseph’s College on Jul. 18.
As the Pioneer reported in its Oct. 5 issue, Jeffrey Belnap, the dean of LIU Global, has been appointed the acting dean of the college of liberal arts, succeeding chemistry Professor Nicholas Ramer, who was the acting dean of the college from June 2015 to August 2016. Ramer replaced former Dean Katherine Hill-Miller, who stepped down from the position in 2015 and returned to her position as a professor in the English department.
Art therapy professor, Christine Kerr, became the acting dean of the college of art, communications and design on Sept. 1, succeeding Noel Zahler, who left the University in August.
Stacey Gopack, who was the acting dean of the School of Health Professions last year, is the newly appointed permanent dean of that school.
Only Robert Valli, the dean of the College of Management, has been in his position since 2015.
Some students have expressed confusion and frustration about the coming and going of the deans. Senior economics major Marvin Johnson has had positive experiences with going to deans for help throughout his academic career. Johnson feels that with many of the deans stepping down and the administration constantly needing to find new replacements, many students may begin to feel lost. “Some students have a unique bond with certain deans and by them switching up and resigning, it just makes the students feel not wanted,” Johnson said. “It’s like a puppy with a new owner.”

On Friday, Oct. 13, the day before Homecoming, students were surprised to find 25 new yellow bicycles spread out across the campus, with multiple bikes chained to bike racks in front of Post Hall, Brookville Hall, the library, and between Nassau and Suffolk Halls.
Students received an email from President Kimberly Cline later that day, explaining that the new bikes had many uses, “whether it is rushing to your next class or squeezing in a quick workout.”
Students were expected to follow an “honor code,” according to the president’s email. Students were given the code “1954,” to unlock bike chains and to use the bikes at their own pleasure on campus, free of charge. Unfortunately, within days of their introduction to the campus, bikes were missing or damaged. Some bikes were hidden around campus, or taken into buildings and rooms to keep other students from being able to ride them. Another instance that occurred included the use of a personal lock to chain the campus bike.
Scott Carlin, the director of Center for Sustainability, is delighted that the administration offered on-campus bicycles to students.
Several years ago, students in the department of Earth and environmental science explored several alternative bicycle options for the campus. “Student research included working with third-party companies that manage and maintain the bicycles, [create] bicycle paths on the campus, and working to make sure that bicycles, pedestrians, and cars can share the campus safely,” Carlin said.
Carlin went on to say that it is not unusual for new bike programs to experience growing pains, and posed the same questions many students are asking. Should students be able to borrow bicycles anonymously or should they need an ID to borrow them? What happens with at tires and other maintenance issues? Who will be responsible?
Campus Life did not comment on the misconduct with bikes on campus. “We are excited to hear the initial feedback about the bike program. Students have been riding bikes around campus and we are happy that the program has been such a success,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said in an email. His email goes on to state, “As with any new program, we are constantly evaluating to determine future improvements and enhancements.
Students who have feedback regarding the program are encouraged to contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299-2800.”

Despite the chaos in the world and reports of prejudice in the news, many minorities in the United States – blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and others – are excelling academically in college and thriving in life generally. Too often, we forget the contributions they make in our communities, socially and culturally. It is disappointing to see the rage that they experience when still being labeled as the minorities in our multicultural society. Students often feel stigmatized when labels are placed on them, often because of their socio-economic status. Many overcome the labels, however, soar through this issue and lead by example. Blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities in our communities should not feel like outcasts, because all lives matter.
Pablo Correa, the 2016 salutatorian of Hempstead High School, is a sophomore at Dartmouth College. Although he is undecided about his major, he is leaning towards anthropology, with global health and chemistry minors. He is also on the pre-med track. Before entering college, he was actively involved in his high school, serving as Vice President of the Hempstead High School class, Vice President of Club Truth, President and Refounder of Future Doctors of America, and more. Correa, who was born in Colombia, came to the United States when he was four years old. As high school came to an end, he became determined to face the next chapter of his academic career with determination and excellence. Yet, he felt like an outcast during the college application process. “I can’t say for sure that I have experienced racial profiling, but I have felt like an outsider in many different situations, most of them here at Dartmouth or when I was visiting other schools like Princeton or Cornell,” he said.
Correa has encountered moments when he felt uncomfortable sitting in class in college because he was the only racial/ethnic minority in the room. Yet, he has not allowed this to deter him from academic success. Correa continues to go to events on campus and he makes it apparent that he is a low-income, first generation college student. Correa became actively involved in Dartmouth’s First Year Student Enrichment Program. This program enables first-generation students to become used to the college environment. With the help of the director of the program, he became acquainted with the resources Dartmouth has to offer, which helped him in his transition into the new environment. Correa’s mother reminds him to ignore the connotations placed on him because of his race. He continues to give back to Hempstead High School students by returning to discuss Dartmouth and the college application process.
“While in college, it’s very important to focus on yourself and not where everyone else is at,” Correa said. “I know that’s a very difficult thing to do, but it is also important. The only person you should compare yourself to is your older self.”
Karen Lopez, the 2014 Valedictorian from Hempstead High School, is a senior at Columbia University, majoring in economics. She was born in El Salvador and came to the United States when she was eight years old. She is now happily living in the city. The transition from Salvador to the United States was difficult for her because English wasn’t her first language. As time passed, Lopez practiced English with the help of her third grade teacher. Fast forward to senior year, Lopez realized how challenging the college application was for her. She focused on Ivy League schools because of the need-based financial assistance. The competitiveness of applying to these schools drove her hunger to become intellectually challenged.
“Focusing on Ivy Leagues and coming from a school like Hempstead High School was hard in itself because I found people doubting me. I didn’t have too many people to look up to. I couldn’t speak to my parents about the stress of the process and I couldn’t look at anyone else in my family because I was the first one to consider going to college. This truly tested my perseverance as I questioned myself many times if I was good enough to go to a top college,” she said.
Lopez felt intimidated at first when she visited colleges and it was difficult for her to find her voice in a new environment. She saw that there weren’t many students with her racial background at the top Ivy League schools. This has driven her to work even harder in her school work to show that she can make it in life, regardless of where she comes from. Although it took her a year to embrace her culture at Columbia University, this was the time she needed. She decided to join Latinxs, a student organization on campus. This transformed her whole college experience.
“I realized that while I did like being exposed to different people, I also needed the space to spend time with people who looked like me and who were facing similar struggles. Through this organization, I met some of my closest friends and started to learn a lot from them about Latinidad and what it meant to be trailblazers in our communities,” she said.
Dondre Lemon, a junior journalism major at LIU Post who is black, was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts and moved to the Bronx when he was six months old. The transition from the city to Long Island was difficult for him when he arrived at Post.
“When I first arrived on campus, I did feel different from the other students because the majority of the students were from Long Island and I was a city kid that didn’t know certain topics students would talk about,” he said. Although this took a toll on him when he started at Post, his passion for unity of cultures drove him to become more interested in reporting and journalism. Lemon has demonstrated to professors and others that it depends on the individual, not the color of their skin. People would not have guessed that Lemon was a reporter in the Bronx while he was in high school. He demonstrated excellence by receiving an award for his reporting skills and by publishing two articles with the nor news. Lemon is a staff writer now for the LIU Post school newspaper and the creator of the new PTV- Pioneer news show. He is thankful for the support system that has helped him with his transition to the college environment.
“Almost every professor helped me in some way. A lot of them definitely made the transition easier for me and warmed me up to the campus. I definitely know my success coach helped a lot, making me feel comfortable, if I had any problems; I know I can go to her for anything. Having friends has also helped me, and what makes it better for me is that I am meeting new people of different cultures, which I feel everyone should have in their circle of friends,” he said.
Next year, Lemon will take an editorial position on the student newspaper. He continues to be an inspiration for students coming from low socio-economic backgrounds who may lack confidence in their abilities.
Lemon believes that the negative stereotyping and labeling needs to change. “The first thing I do is tell my friends of color not to classify any group. Don’t say all whites this, or Muslims that. Right now, we need to be together and be united, no matter the color of your skin,” he said.
As a reporter, Lemon wants to show others that they do not have to have a high socio-economic background or grow up in a wealthy community to make it in any career they desire. “If I can inspire one person that they can make it just the way they are, I will definitely feel like I have made a difference in the world,” he said.
Amoy Brown, 2016 graduate of Hempstead High School, is now a sophomore at the University of Albany, with
an English major and journalism minor. She was born in Jamaica and moved to America when she was five years old. Brown has also felt like an outcast in a college that’s predominately white. Growing up in Hempstead, people had expectations of how she is supposed to behave. However, she proves them wrong.
“My skin color is something that I have definitely became more conscious of,” she said. Also with the world today, it’s kind of hard to do anything without thinking about the barriers that race does cause.”
In Brown’s college environment, she has noticed instances in which she was the only black person in her class, but she didn’t let this hold her back. “Just because I’m more conscious of it now doesn’t mean it makes me any less confident in who I am or what I do,” she said
With this confidence, Brown has taken advantage of what the university offers. She noticed how UAlbany celebrates cultures. She found various organizations that help empower people of color like herself. She joined an organization called the Black Theater Production, which promotes the performing arts for people of color. In addition, Brown was awarded a journalism internship with the student affairs media team. She also joined an organization called “Her Campus,” an online magazine where she can express herself.
Tibian Ahmed, a senior at Stony Brook University, was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Ahmed, who is Muslim,
has encountered many instances when she has been racially profiled and has felt like an outcast, especially during her years of schooling.
“As early as elementary school all the way through my now final semester at college. It’s happened at work, my internships, even in personal settings meeting some of my non Muslim friends’ parents,” she said.
At times, in social settings at school, Ahmed has felt tested because of the comments made about her. She noticed how students would take pictures of her and make fun of her while she was sitting in the dining hall. People would also taunt with her hijab. Ahmed was the only girl who wore the hijab at her first school, SUNY Brockport. “People would purposely work in groups of three so that they wouldn’t work with me,” she said.
Ahmed has had uncomfortable situations with professors as well. During her freshman year at SUNY Brockport, students were assigned a 10 page research paper and the professor gave the topics to the students. The professors gave her, ‘Should the U.S Iraq war have started?” She was the only student assigned this topic. She had no choice but to comply with the professor’s request. In order to make this assignment unbiased, Ahmed made sure she asked other students if they thought the war should have started. Towards the end of her presentation, the professor stated her own biased opinion.
Ahmed has encountered other moments when professors would make thoughtless statements about Islamic terrorism or extremism and try to convince her that her hijab is an inconvenience. Also, professors at both colleges she attended have asked her how the process was for her family coming to the United States as refugees. Ahmed felt as if they were committed to setting a low standard for her by assuming she wasn’t American. Ahmed had to overcome these situations on her own because her parents didn’t have the same experiences. Because her siblings are significantly younger, they too didn’t understand what she has gone through. Ahmed also realized the significance of the date September 10, 2001, the day before 9/11. This was the day she placed her hijab on for the very first time, when she was six years old.
Although she has faced criticism, Ahmed used this to elevate herself in school instead. She began interning at CNN. She interned with white men who were middle aged and she noticed how they had a different tone with her as she stepped in to contribute.
“I get it, because they didn’t experience people like me. This is a pattern; this is how they have been taught to think, and it’s a bigger issue. It’s unfortunate, you are at a point where you can think for yourself but they chose not to, people chose not to challenge themselves because it’s more convenient for them,” she said.
Before transferring to Stony Brook, Ahmed became a speaker for the diversity conference at her first school, SUNY Brockport. She spoke out to faculty members and students about her life growing up post 9/11 and her experiences. Ahmed also founded the MSA (Muslim Student Association), which tries to bring a Muslim friendly environment to students, holding events about Islam awareness and reaching out to non-Muslim students on campus about their experiences growing up on post 9/11.
“It’s either I was going to do something to make myself feel like I belong there or just let it get to me,” Ahmed said.
At Stony Brook, Ahmed has become an executive producer for Newsbreak En Espanol and also an EOP success coach to mentor students on time management, critical thinking and writing skills.
“Don’t keep yourself in a bubble – what scares you the most is the most important thing to challenge yourself with,” she said. “You need to be respectful and make sure you are not a part of the problem.”
These students, like so many of their peers, have overcome prejudice and stereotyping by working hard and demonstrating excellence. The issue has not gone away and needs to be further addressed in our communities today.
Until then, let’s continue to work hard and demonstrate that we are all the same. It’s time to stand up and remember we are all dreamers. Let’s make the labeling stop and make America great again in this way.

Editor’s Note: In light of recent mass shootings in the U.S., the Pioneer is republishing the university’s guidelines and protocols issued in Feb. 2017 as a public service for the school community.
There have been 317 mass shootings in the United States, close to one every day, in 2017, according to the Gun Violence archive. The harsh reality of mass shootings is that they could occur at any place and anytime. Since 1999, there have been 31 mass school shootings in the United States, which have made worldwide headlines and devastated school communities. The massacres at Columbine High School, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and Virginia Tech University, among others, have led schools, including LIU Post, to strengthen their security protocols and strategize if it were to happen to them.
The LIU Post Department of Public Safety includes 22 full-time, New York State certified security officers. It is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors on LIU Post’s campus. The department works with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments, and the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management. The Public Safety Department created its own guidelines in early 2017, based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s “Active Shooter: How to Respond” booklet, which includes emergency phone numbers and tactics. The guidelines are on the university website at http://liu.edu/cwpost/Public-safety.
According to the university guidelines, “because active shooter situations are often over within ten-to- fteen minutes before law enforcement [or Public Safety] arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared both mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.” Within that time frame, the guidelines suggests to “take note of the two nearest exits,” “secure the door [in the room],” “if in a hallway, get into a room and secure the door,” and as a last resort, “attempt to take the shooter down.” If an active shooter is in your vicinity, the guidelines call to “escape if possible,” and “hideout where the shooter is less likely to find you while [remaining silent].” If you are the first person to call 911, the guidelines suggest to provide the phone operator with as many details possible, including location of the shooter, the number of shooters, if more than one, physical description of the shooter(s), number and type(s) of weapons, and number of potential victims at the location.
Michael Fevola, who became the Director of Public Safety in August 2017, said his team would rely on text messaging and emails during active shooter situations, although he has not experienced one on campus.
“In the event of an incident including an active shooter, Public Safety has protocols in place and the ability to immediately alert the entire campus community via a mass text/email blast with specific advisements and instructions,” Fevola said. “Those messages can also be used to continuously update the community, alert individuals what areas they should stay away from, and what to do, including the “Run/Hide/ Fight” protocols.” The Pioneer reported that the “Run/Hide/Fight” protocol was instituted in February 2017. “[It was] not in response to something happening, just to keep the campus safe,” Dr. John Lutz, English professor and chair of the faculty council, said in The Pioneer’s article, “Stop, Drop, Roll” published on Feb. 15, 2017. Lutz said, at the time, that faculty members had expressed an interest in learning more about campus procedures during an emergency, which led to a meeting for faculty on Feb. 1. At the meeting, Paul Rapess, the former director of Public Safety who retired last summer, discussed the new procedure, which implemented to keep up to date with happenings.
The Public Safety department routinely conducts joint training exercises with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments on campus. With this training in place, local police have a better feel for the campus during emergency situations.
According to LIU Post’s CampusFirearms & Weapons Policy, which is available on the LIU website under ‘University Policies,’ says “the possession of dangerous weapons, including any pistol, revolver, an incendiary bomb, switchblade, dagger or bludgeon, as well as harmless instruments designed to look like weapons are prohibited” on campus. “Other than police officers or military personnel on active duty, no person, including a licensee, may possess rearms anywhere on campus, whether in a building or on the grounds, without the prior written permission of the campus Provost and Director of Public Safety.” Violators of this policy will be subject to immediate disciplinary action and potential criminal prosecution. LIU Post strictly enforces its campus gun policy. As The Pioneer reported several years ago, on Nov. 17, 2011, a 72-year-old criminal justice adjunct professor accidentally shot himself in the groin and leg before his class. Although he was a retired Fire Marshall licensed to carry a weapon, the no weapons policy on campus was strictly enforced and he no longer teaches at LIU Post.
Katherine Hill-Miller, English professor and former dean of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences suggests every student and staff member should sign up for the Public Safety alerts, and said she would follow direction from Public Safety in an emergency.
“My first action would be to check for the text message and follow its directions,” Hill-Miller said. “If a message hadn’t come through, I’d assume that the incident hadn’t been reported, so I’d dial 911 first and then call campus security. Barring any information from anybody, I’d evaluate the situation—if the shooter was close, I’d gather students away from windows and doors in the classroom.”
Freshman education major Amanda Iovino agrees that the public safety alerts would come in handy in times of danger. “The texts are very useful in times of bad weather, and I think if [a school shooting] was to happen, the texts would be crucial.”
Fevola advises students and staff members to always be alert to their surroundings. While school shootings do not happen very often, he stressed that anything could happen, and one person reporting a suspicious person could potentially save lives.
“Stay vigilant and follow the old adage ‘see something, say something,’” Fevola said. “Any odd or unusual behavior should be reported to Public Safety, and we always protect [the] anonymity of the caller.”

Long Island University President Kimberly R. Cline’s contract was extended an additional six years, until Dec. 2023. The Board of Trustees announced the contract extension to the campus community by email on Thursday, Nov. 16. Eric Krasnoff, Chair of the Board of Trustees, wrote that President Cline’s contract was extended due to her “outstanding accomplishments” since her hire in July 2013.
As the 10th President of LIU, Cline has helped to improve the university “academically, financially, and in the involvement with the communities we serve,” Krasnoff wrote in the email. Since Cline’s start, the university’s endowment has reached $200 million, she has secured over $100 million in scholarships, and has implemented a number of programs to “move the university forward,” he added.
But just how did she do it?
“Success is derived from strategy,” Cline said in an interview with The Pioneer on Nov. 22, elaborating on the “Strategic Plan,” a collaborative plan focused on academic excellence, a secure and sustainable financial position, an expanded culture of community engagement, a vibrant and distinctive student experience, and recognition as a “best value” institution by 2020.
Several of these goals outlined in the Strategic Plan have already been met, Cline said. New programs such as international relations and diplomacy, sports management, and nursing complete with the new simulation lab, have been successful in the short time they have been implemented, she said. Students are able to experience a “robust student life” with events across the university, at Tilles Center for Performing Arts, and with the Global Institute that expand their perspectives and invite them to think on higher levels; and the university has secured a stable financial footing, she added.
Yet students and faculty have raised concerns.
The Faculty Council, composed of LIU faculty members, sent a four page letter to the New York State Education Department (NYSED) on June 28, which provided an overview of “violations of accreditation standards, shared governance, questionable financial operations, and mismanagement of student support services.” The Faculty Council followed up its initial letter four months later with a 284 page report detailing the charges against the administration and Board of Trustees. The larger document, created by Faculty Council President and English Professor John Lutz and several other members of the Faculty Council, was filled with supporting documentation for NYSED.
“These issues are a sign of a breakdown in the communication process,” Lutz said. Many faculty are feeling that the “shared governance,” which is a collaboration between faculty and the administration to best serve the education of students, within the university is beginning to crumble. “Faculty don’t feel like their collaboration is meaningful [to the administration] in a lot of areas,” he said. “Faculty interact with students every day, we have a point of view on what students need and it hasn’t been considered.”
Yet, Cline stated, “I am an over-communicator,” despite faculty complaints about a lack of transparency. “I want to make sure that people do feel that they know what is going on and that they feel comfortable with it.” At senior administration meetings, Cline has begun to include the new deans in the conversation, and the idea is that they in turn will communicate to the department chairs, and then the chairs to the faculty and so on.
“There are conversations going on all the time, yet conveying an adequate point of view is difficult,” Lutz said, expressing faculty frustration.
“Our faculty is deeply committed to providing students the transformative liberal arts education that [our] mission statement celebrates,” Willie Hiatt, associate professor of Latin American history, said.
“However, we continue to have deep concerns about university leadership and how it is affecting our financial and intellectual vitality.”
Among the many issues brought up within the document submitted by the faculty to the state education department, there have been several violations that jeopardize accreditation in key programs, according to Hiatt. Majors, programs, and support have been cut without consulting the faculty. Staffing deflects and a lack of institutional support in areas such as LIU Promise mean that the university is failing in its commitment to student success and degree completion, faculty members state.
President Cline did not respond about the allegations in the NYSED document specifically, yet on the topic of LIU Promise, and in light of the editorial written by the Pioneer’s Editor in Chief on Nov. 1 about her experience with her success coaches,“Switching to 120 Credits: My Nightmare,” Cline admitted that the LIU Promise office is in transition. “When I first brought this promise program, the first year I was very engaged in it. At some point it started to pivot from its birth.” Cline said she is beginning to work with Promise again, in order to return it to an area of continuous outreach and engagement. “We [would like] to have [coaches] individually tailored to the student,” she said. “It’s not always going to be perfect.”
In regard to the cutting of majors and programs, Cline said the programs that were eliminated were “undersubscribed” with “zero- to-two” students occasionally. “It’s unconscionable to try and teach someone by themselves in those programs,” she said.
Enrollments over the past four years have been “struggling,” according to both Lutz and Hiatt. “We’ve had declining enrollments,” Lutz said. “This fall, the incoming class enrollments went up [from 500 to 701], but transfers and graduation numbers went down.” Hiatt added, “The administration has failed to solve LIU’s enrollment crisis and has not sustained the level of fundraising necessary to provide students the scholarships and support services they deserve and desperately need.”
Cline disagrees. The university has secured over $100 million in scholarships, and that does not include the scholarships from various donors such as the Sanford scholarship or the Winnick scholarship, she said. She has also convinced the Board to keep tuition increases at 2 percent until 2020 to keep tuition affordable. “The goal is for 100 percent graduation rate – a little unusual, I know, but when you have students that are passionate about the university, and really want to be at LIU, we want to be there to see them through.”
Hiatt believes that the timing of Mr. Krasnoff’s decision to extend President Cline’s contract appeared “premature at best” since the board has yet to acknowledge, address, and hold the administration accountable for these failings or to do anything to fix these problems raised by faculty. Both Cline and Lutz have confirmed that an ad hoc committee of the board received the faculty document sent to NYSED a week and a half ago, and has agreed to meet with faculty and speak about the concerns addressed in the document once they complete a review. A meeting date has not yet been determined.
“There are many hardworking, talented faculty, administrators, and staff at Post, and we’re all dedicated to improving the experience of students and preparing them for flourishing personal and professional lives,” Lutz said. “Faculty and administration sometimes have differing points of view about how to do this, but students should trust that we will work out these differences to provide them with a meaningful education.”

“Beginning in the 2019-20 academic year, LIU will compete in all sports at the NCAA Division I level, with a unified athletics program that will join our campuses into One LIU,” university president Kimberly Cline wrote in an email announcement to the LIU community on Wednesday, Oct. 3, halfway into the fall 2018 season, and two weeks after the academic add/ drop period deadline on Sept. 18.
“The unification of the Division I and Division II athletic teams into a more robust Division I program will have long term benefits for LIU and the Northeast Conference from an athletic, academic and community standpoint,” NEC commissioner Noreen Morris said during an LIU press conference at the New York Athletic Club on Oct. 3.
Along with seven Post sports teams being elevated from Division II to Division I, the LIU Post basketball (men’s and women’s), women’s bowling, women’s fencing, softball, women’s swimming, track & field (men’s and women’s), and women’s volleyball teams will move to the Brooklyn campus, where a multipurpose athletic facility will begin construction in 2019. New women’s ice hockey and water polo teams will be added in Brooklyn.
The LIU Post football team will move to the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), the lower of the two Division I levels. Football players are excited about the change, as they will not be losing their positions. LIU Brooklyn has no football team, and their stadium will be renovated to meet Division I regulations.
The announcement, which emphasized the unity of the individual athletics programs into “One LIU,” has rocked student athletes on the Post campus. For many of the Pioneers, this is not exciting news.
All Post sports teams play under the NCAA Division II, as they have since their inception. The sudden announcement of the transition to Division I in the middle of the current season has caused distress and uncertainty among many Post athletes about their future athletic and academic careers. Post students will have to re-tryout for positions on the new Division I rosters, competing with current LIU Brooklyn students and freshmen recruits for those same spots next year.
Sports that are combining include basketball (men’s and women’s), soccer (men’s and women’s), baseball, softball and women’s lacrosse. The men’s lacrosse and men’s cross country will move to the Northeast Conference.
Ashley Melendez, a senior childhood and early education major, was one of the unhappy students on the softball team. “We could not believe the news. We were all heartbroken that this selfish decision was made without even speaking to any of the athletes,” she said. “We were completely blindsided and devastated that this selfish act is going to break our family apart.”
An FAQ page posted on Oct. 3 on the new one.liu.edu, or athletics.liu.edu website addresses questions about the change. The question of Post athletes being able to continue their positions in the Division I teams has student athletes most concerned. According to the site, the athletics department “will personally work with each individual student-athlete to review all potential opportunities athletically and academically within the new athletic department.”
Newsday reported on Wednesday, Oct. 3 that, “LIU teams will draw athletes from both campuses,” but, “the 2019- 20 rosters will be decided at the discretion of each team.”
Many Post athletes, who qualified for Division II sports, fear they will not make the new teams. “There’s a chance that we might get cut. We don’t know anything; we don’t know
if we are going to keep our coach. We literally have nothing,” Jillian Lomanto, a junior education major and member of the lacrosse team, said. Without further information, Lomanto believes nothing about their team will remain the same.
The method and timing of the announcement were questioned by students and faculty. Many athletes feel underappreciated. “When the president announced it, she didn’t take the athletes’ feelings into consideration. She literally just said this is fine, she’s getting paid for this. It’s the athletes who are getting hurt right now,” Lomanto said.
The students are also concerned about their coaches. “It’ll be very hard if my coach is not the same coach [for women’s lacrosse]. If she’s [Coach Megan McNamara] not the coach, none of us are going to be playing,” Katelyn Politi, a sophomore elementary education and special education major, said.
International student-athletes were especially concerned. Those who were recruited internationally were either signed into a contract to play in Division II, or can only play in Division II based on their semi-professional athletic careers in their home countries before enrolling at LIU Post. Multiple Post teams, such as the women’s and men’s soccer teams, have rosters comprised of mainly international players.
The unified sports teams will have an even bigger impact on campus. The school’s colors will change from the Pioneers green and gold and the Blackbirds blue and black, to a unified blue and gold. The cost of replacing and redesigning the signs and facilities, including the upgrade of both campus athletic facilities, the Bethpage Credit Union Stadium and new uniforms, apparel and signage on both campuses, could be high.
The Bethpage Credit Union Stadium will receive a makeover, with upgraded grandstands to improve sight lines for fans, and to meet Division I standards. “This project will make Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium among the most modern facilities of its size on the East Coast and provide an ideal game day environment for our student-athletes and supporters,” according to a statement on the athletics.liu.edu site.
Roy Fergus, the director of facilities services for both campuses, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the timing, execution and price of these projects.
Unifying the university athletic departments under Division I could help increase the profile of the school, as LIU’s administration stated in the statement announcing the change, however it will come with sacrifices, according to multiple students and faculty members.
“What’s stunning about the LIU announcement is the consolidation of sports from two autonomous campuses, one Division I and one Division II, with different colors and mascots, and telling roughly half the 1,600 student-athletes that they’ll no longer have an athletics future at LIU,” Willie Hiatt, associate professor of history, said. “We’re forcing them to compete against each other for roster spots. I can’t imagine that a ‘Hunger Games’ scenario like that happens very often.”
Hiatt believes there was an unspoken reason for the merger. “The timing of the announcement also was a slap in the face to athletes. The slick ‘One LIU’ branding didn’t happen overnight,” he said. “Why didn’t the administration make this announcement at least last spring or summer to give students the chance to find another school? With another small freshman class of 550 students or so, was this to avoid worsening our enrollment crisis? And why do this after the add/drop period? If we care about our students, we should allow them a full tuition refund if they choose to leave LIU right now. That’s the least we can do. If I were a parent, I’d be asking for that for my child,” Hiatt said.
Lacrosse player Politi agrees with Hiatt on the timing. “I don’t think [the administration] did it in the right way,” she said. “Especially for people recruited over the summer. They didn’t tell them and [the recruited students] make decisions [on where to go to school] and they had no idea that they were going from a D.2 to a D.1 program, which is a huge difference.”
Students and faculty believe that the change had been planned for some time. “If they knew about [this change] for years, they should’ve told us the summer of 2018 so people had time to digest this new information, instead of telling teams during and right
before their seasons,” Veronica Saager, a junior special education major and member of the women’s soccer team, said.
“If I was a freshman, I might look into transferring,” Lomanto said.
Student athletes are still debating their next steps. Students have created several protests on social media, including a petition that now has over three thousand signatures and a not.my.liu.post Instagram page that has over 400 followers.

“The School for Good and Evil” by Soman Chainani is the first book in a fantastic fantasy series. This first book tells the story of best friends Sophie and Agatha, living in the isolated town of Gavaldon. Every four years on November 11, according to legend, a School Master kidnaps two children from the village. One kidnapped child is always beautiful and kind, and the other is homely and odd. These children are taken to the School for Good and Evil, which exists somewhere beyond the woods surrounding Gavaldon. The children are never seen again, unless they appear in a fairy tale, one as a hero and the other as a villain.
Sophie, who is beautiful and focuses on her looks and good deeds, believes that she will be kidnapped for the School for Good. Meanwhile, Agatha, who is ugly and wears only black, doesn’t believe the School exists but seems like the perfect candidate for the School for Evil. They are the two kids who are kidnapped by the School Master that year. However, Agatha is brought to the School for Good, and Sophie to the School for Evil. What first appears to be a great mistake turns into an adventure that not only reveals the character’s truest selves, but also blurs the lines between the stereotypes of good and evil.
Along the way, Sophie and Agatha meet the other students, who are descendants of fairytale characters. The best friends from Gavaldon take classes at their mismatched schools while they try to solve a riddle the School Master gave them that will lead them home. However, the School Master is more than what he seems, and has a different ending in store for Sophie and Agatha.
“The School for Good and Evil” is a very entertaining book, but the plot doesn’t go far beyond the school. Although this series takes place in a much larger world, the first book takes place only in Gavaldon and the School. The world of fairy tales is supposedly endless, but readers don’t get to experience much of this world in the first book. One must read the rest of the series to see more of this magical world of Good and Evil.
In “The School for Good and Evil,” nothing is as simple as it seems. It is a great read for those who like dramatic twists and sneaky foreshadowing in their books.

In “Smite,” we are introduced to Ullr: The Glorious One. In the game, Ullr is designed in heavy robes and a hood, he also wears a bow and arrow and his twin axes. As a hunter god that lives in the frigid north, this design could not be more fitting.

There are many gods in Norse mythology, but few are as highly regarded as Ullr, “The Hunter God of Glory.” In both mythology and in “Smite,” Ullr doesn’t represent the boastfulness or shameful satisfaction one gets from seeing others fall. He is honorable and pays respect to true glory in all its forms.
For Ullr, glory is in the silence of snow fall, the perfect curve of a bow firing an arrow, the honorable victory earned in single combat and the moment of life’s rebirth. In Norse mythology, “The Hunter God of Glory” is an enigma ever keeping to himself. In “Smite,” Ullr is secretive and knows that true glory lies in remote hideaways, untouched by the hands of time, and it is in these very hideaways the shrines to Ullr can be found.
Ullr is highly respected even among the gods, for it his him and not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the all father is away. While other gods would abuse the power the throne brings, Ullr knows that his rule is an extension of Odin’s will.
The mythology states that Ullr is a skilled archer and an expert in close combat; this is no different in “Smite.” In the game, Ullr’s attacks and abilities revolve around his skills as a hunter. His passive ability is called weapons master; this allows Ullr to switch between fighting with his bow and his axes, and it is here that we see Ullr’s true skills. With his bow, Ullr’s abilities allow him to attack multiple
enemies at once while his axe-based abilities are for single combat.
Ullr’s second ability is called expose weakness. This allows Ullr to land critical hits easily. Just as his mythology counterpart finds glory in a bow firing an arrow true, Smite’s Ullr is able to find the perfect shot without hesitation.
Ullr’s ultimate is called Wield Axes; with this Ullr gains additional physical strength and lifesteal which allows him to deal more damage to a single enemy. This ties in to his mythology as it tells how Ullr finds honor in single combat and pays respect to his fallen foe.
While not much is known about Ullr, “Smite” does a good job of paying respect to his mythology and gives us a character that is both accurate and fun to play with.

The name Mia McLeod will go down in women’s ice hockey program history. On Tuesday, Oct. 8, the Sharks received their first player recognition in the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance as Mia McLeod was named “Rookie of the Week.”
The Canadian received the award after a well-deserved weekend of play. In the Sharks’ inaugural opening night against University of Connecticut, McLeod faced 53 shots and made 49 saves. This left the freshman goalie with a save percent-age of 93 percent after her first night of play. 
Head Coach Rob Morgan had been watching Mia in net since his days coaching at Yale University. He had first seen her play at the age of 14, and once Morgan was named the head coach at LIU, “it was a no brainer,” about bringing McLeod to come play for him, he said. 
McLeod began playing hockey at the age of eight, but didn’t become a goalie until she was 10. The first time she tried the goalie position, McLeod was hooked.L “You do rotations as a goalie and everyone gets a chance and it was my turn and I just kind of stuck with it. I liked it and I felt kind of good at it,” McLeod said. 
As a five-sport athlete in high school, Mia McLeod is no stranger to a highly competitive environment. She competed in cross country, volleyball, hockey, track, and ultimate Frisbee. 
“Ultimate Frisbee was really fun, I had never played it before and then I started in grade ten and it was just something to do on the side, and it was really fun,” McLeod said.    
With hockey at the top of McLeod’s list of favorites, track and field came as a close second of the sports she’s participated in. McLeod also competed as a pole vaulter for three years in high school. 
“It was something different to do than hockey but just learning how and flying in the air in pole vaulting was really fun,” she said. 
The Sharks have left their footprint in Division I Ice Hockey as they became the first ever program on the island. However, for McLeod and her squad, it hasn’t been an easy task. The Sharks’ biggest challenge for both coaches and players is having such a young team. With 23 team members, 21 are freshmen. The other two players are transfer students that came in as a sophomore and a junior. “Usually, it’s your seniors that will set the tone or raise the bar because it’s their last year to try and win. But right now, they have four years to win. We want to have that mindset that we are a team that can win our conference every year,” Coach Morgan said.
McLeod also feels the pressure of having a young team. However, she reminds herself that they are making history. She believes that she and her team can take their skills and strengths and win a conference championship. 
On Friday, Oct. 18, McLeod and her team will take on reigning National Women’s Ice Hockey Division I Champions against the University of Wisconsin Badgers at their home arena in Syosset, New York.

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic illness that affects millions of families each year. According to the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, PD is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. Modern medicine and neurologists have been developing stronger and more effective treatments for this disease every year. 
Dr. Gemma Moya-Galé is a professor at LIU Brooklyn  and speech-language pathologist who researches PD. Her expertise can be most notably witnessed in her recently published article “The effects of intensive speech treatment on intelligibility in Parkinson’s disease: A randomised controlled trial”, where she discusses the newfound breakthroughs in the use of intensive speech treatment to improve speech intelligibility for those with PD.
“Our study was the first one to examine conversational intelligibility gains in a randomized controlled trial for PD and we were able to provide evidence of treatment benefits to improve that aspect of their lives. The clinical implications for this are, therefore, huge,” Moya-Galé said. 
Moya-Galé’s goal is to improve the quality of life in her and her colleagues’ patients. Her study that was published by the Lancet took six years to complete, and contained documented and verified research supporting both Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD) effectiveness, as well the importance of physical activity. 
“Close to 90% of people with PD develop voice problems over the course of the disease. One of the most devastating consequences patients face in their quality of life is social isolation and withdrawal, given that they lose the ability to be understood, particularly in noisy environments. Once voice problems have appeared and worsened, many patients may decide not to partake in conversations anymore, out of frustration, for example.” 
In order to get a better understanding of the disease itself, Moya Galé elaborated on what exactly the nature of the disease entails.
 “The disease is progressive and it may start long before a diagnosis is made, loss of smell could actually be one of the first signs. Getting the right treatment is crucial, as many times modifications to medication have to be made based on patients’ reactions to it.” 
LSVT LOUD treatment, is the most well researched and understood kind of treatment used to treat individuals. The LOUD part of the treatment, refers to patients using their loud voice, and emphasizes use of sounds like “AH” at various pitch tones, in order to rehabilitate their speech. 
“[LSVT LOUD] is currently the gold standard in the treatment of hypophonia in PD. It also has decades of research behind it that show its benefits in improving not only voice, but also facial expressions, or even swallowing,” she said. 
Moya-Galé said that LSVT LOUD has significantly improved intelligibility and patients with PD’s ability to be understood. This is important because there is a gap between the communication levels of the patient with PD and their caregivers. Improving the communication between the patient and the caregivers will improve the overall mental well being and stability of those with PD because they will know that they can still speak clearly enough to be understood. 
Moya-Galé believes that exercise is also essential to improving the neuroplasticity in patients with PD. Neuroplasticity is the concept that the brain can still learn, improve and remain malleable even within the patient’s final years being alive.
 “Physical activity not only improves aspects like balance and walking, remember that people with PD are at a greater risk of falls, so addressing these problems is very important for overall safety, but it can also increase quality of life, for example, by fostering and prolonging the individual’s independence,” she said.
Moya-Galé urges those with PD to begin rehabilitation as soon as possible.
“Rehabilitation is key in PD, and the earlier someone starts receiving those services (including physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and such) the better. Rehabilitation services undoubtedly improve quality of life and we, as therapists, advocate for their early implementation,” said Moya-Galé. 
While she does hope there will be a cure in the traditional sense, she still noted that there are factors within our control that can prevent the disease interfering drastically with the patients lives. 
“As for habits or factors that could have a protective role; exercise is key. Physical activity has tremendous benefits …  not just for maintaining good physical function but also cognitive function.” 
Moya-Galé continues to study PD and work as a speech pathologist in order to foster independence in patients so that they can keep their voice for as long as possible.
Her work not only continues to impact the lives of not just her patients, and their families, but the scientific community, who research PD and attempt to learn how to effectively treat those who develop PD, at any stage of their life.
For more information about speech therapy treatments for PD, refer to Moya-Galé’s research on “The Lancet”.

All classes at Post were moved to remote instruction for a period of two weeks as of Oct. 15. University President Kimberly Cline sent out a mass email to the Post community stating that “Last weekend, a small number of positive cases were reported as a result of off-campus social gatherings that violated LIU’s Code of Conduct. Additional cases were reported over the past few days by students who were in contact with students at the gatherings. Most of these cases were contact traced back to these isolated events. Some students, who have not tested positive, have been asked to quarantine.”
    There were a number of students who were required to quarantine because they had been in contact with a student who had coronavirus or tested positive themselves. These students were notified about the matter and moved into Suffolk hall to carry out their isolation. 
“I didn’t prepare for quarantine,” senior psychology major Tiana Ono said. “We got the news last minute that we needed to get tested. One of our friends is an RA and she’s the one who told us that we were being put in quarantine that night so to start packing. I didn’t get a call until around 8 to 9 p.m. from someone at the school telling me to get out of the dorms. So I had a few hours to pack and grab food and stuff, everything moved very fast.” 
Similar sentiments were shared by senior sports management major Emily Poole. “We did not get much time to prepare. We were told pretty late about the quarantine in a different building so we just packed essentials quickly and moved in,” Poole said.
    Food is delivered to our door by resident assistants and Promise employees.
“The food is pretty basic but as an athlete it’s hard not being able to control what foods we eat,” Poole said. “We get plenty of food and snacks but the quality and healthiness is not the best but we don’t go without so that’s good.” 
    Both students shared that the quarantine has had a slightly positive effect on their studies. With plenty of free time and no distractions from peers or activities, they have had more time to study and do their school work. Ono has found solace in the contact and regularity that her classes offer. “Class throughout the week has been helpful since it gives me something to do,” she said. “Weekends feel very long. It also sucks that we can’t even go outside for a walk or something.”
Poole had a similar opinion of her time in quarantine. “One good thing about this quarantine is that it has been around midterms so plenty of time to study,” she said.
    Poole expressed the difficulty being in isolation. 
“Quarantine is a pretty big mood killer. As an international student this is not my first time doing this but it is so mentally and physically challenging,” she said. “Not having the comforts of your own room, the heat and wifi have not been working great, the air in the room gets stuffy and not getting any fresh air, a walk or exercise is so tough. My fellow quarentiners and I joke that the first few days go by slowly, a week goes by and you think ok that wasn’t too bad but by day 10 you are climbing the walls.”
Ono agreed that being alone all of the time is difficult. “My mood comes and goes. Sometimes I’m happy, sometimes I’m angry, and sometimes I want to jump out of my window. I also wish that they would let us go outside for an hour or something. It really sucks being locked up in a room for a long time.”  
Ono and Poole both tested negative for coronavirus, but were required to quarantine due to being in close contact with individuals who tested positive.

Colder weather on campus means that items like blankets are a must. The Long Island University Field Hockey team is selling blankets available for purchase. The blankets are $60 each and found  on their Instagram page @liufieldhockey. 
Field Hockey Head Coach Raenee Savin says that she got the inspiration for the blankets from a recruiting trip a few years ago. “I was recruiting at a high school field hockey playoff game in late November, and as I stood there freezing, all the fans in the stands were wrapped in their warm blankets, all matching and supporting their team,” she said. “Right after that, I placed our first order! It was perfect timing, as our field hockey team played into December for the NCAA finals.” 
This is not the first year the blankets have been for sale and the blankets have evolved with the school. “We started selling these blankets in the C.W. Post Pioneers generation of LIU. Sales continued as we kept the green and gold,” Coach Savin said. 
Coach Savin is confident the tradition of these blanket sales throughout the colder months of the year have been a success. “Still now, as we transitioned to the blue and gold, LIU Sharks blankets are keeping fans warm in the stands,”she said. “Eight years later, we continue to sell,and get excited with each sale, knowing that our customers are always happy with their purchase!”
While @liufieldhockey recently posted about the blankets, Savin says that anyone can buy the blankets at any time. “There is no end date. We just had a surge in blanket sales and placed another order, but we always have them available for purchase,” she said. 
Additionally, anyone can buy these blankets with shipping or pickup.“For a small additional fee, we are able to ship your blanket.  We also provide contactless pickup on campus,” Savin said. 
Savin encourages everyone to buy a blanket for their practicality and ties to campus. “These blankets are meant for everyone, not just sports fanatics! I keep one on my car and one on my couch. I use it when I travel,” she said  “These blankets wash easily, are super comfortable and are a great way to show off your Shark spirit, great for incoming freshmen or graduating seniors, a blanket in the dorm or even for an alum as a reminder of your years at LIU,”
You can email raenee.savin@liu.edu or brittany.robertson@liu.edu to purchase.

On Thursday, Sept. 30, the music department was given breaking news: the music education major is being frozen. This means that any incoming student at Post may not choose music education as a major, but the students who are already part of the program will be able to finish out their degree.
More news came for other arts students soon after. On Oct. 8, students in the department of theatre, dance and arts management received word that recruitment into the dance and arts management programs would freeze after this school year. 
With programs freezing, students are left wondering if they should stay at Post and what the future holds for their education.
“We got an email from Dr. McRoy who is the director of music education. He wasn’t beating around the bush at all. He just said ‘unfortunately the school has decided to freeze the music education major,’” sophomore music education major Ally Perticone said.
A large majority of the students found out this information while they were in chorus class.
“We were in chorus and everyone’s jaws dropped. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. After all the time and effort we put in,” senior music education major Kaitlyn Sottung said.
The music education majors and their faculty have worked hard to build their program.
“I want the administration to know that people are hurting. It’s not only us, it’s also the faculty. I feel very bad for everyone in my department, especially the faculty because I know how much hard work they put into this. I see the hard work that everyone puts in,” sophomore music education major Mike Shapiro said.
Students in the program thought that  all of their hard work and effort was paying off, especially seeing as the university advertises the music program on various media platforms.
“I think it’s just really unfair. The school portrays their music program and all the opportunities we have here as this great big deal, which it is,” Perticone said. “It’s a really good program we have here. But I hate that they portray it as something bigger than it is. If it’s so great, why are they getting rid of it?” 
There is even a banner on campus stating that Post was rated the best music school on Long Island.
“This program is so near and dear to me and to watch it be ripped away from future students is heartbreaking,” Sottung said.
Some students hope that others will join them in trying to fight for their program, while others think there’s no chance of restoration.
“When they took away the Fine Arts Center (FAC), we were able to advocate for ourselves and help restore the program by having the school put practice rooms in Hillwood. So, I think if we really get the word out and talk to higher administration to fight for our program, it might help,” Shapiro said.
“I personally think that fighting for it isn’t going to work. This is not something we can change their minds on. I don’t think it’s worth trying for,” Perticone said.
The next steps for the music program are unclear at this time, as students and faculty alike continue to grapple with this sudden change despite the decision that the school’s administration made. It’s clear the music community on campus is still strong, and will continue to focus on their craft as long as the school’s administration allows them to.
Students from the dance and arts and administration department are also fighting for their programs.
Junior dance major Abby Steinke recalls all of the opportunities she has received through Post’s dance program.
“We’ve had the opportunity to see companies and work with artists that are high calibre. We’ve been able to choreograph ourselves, like I’ve gotten to choreograph and make my own artistic voice show,” Steinke said.
Steinke says that the Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC) is like a family. She doesn’t think she would be the person she is today without it.
Steinke and the rest of PCDC found out Friday Oct. 8 that their program was to be frozen at the end of the year.
“I was shocked,” Steinke said. “The first thing I wanted to do was be like, okay what can we do to stop it? I’ve been emailing administration, and I messaged the theatre company to email them. I think strength in numbers really works. I think if everyone has something to say about it, then they should listen.”
Steinke has some ideas on how to get the campus’ attention, other than emailing.
“We’re thinking of doing some video things, maybe some flash mobs. The dance program has a big presence in the department, but we need to make that known to campus,” Steinke said.
Steinke believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on this decision. She says that last year the dance program was meant to bring in 13 new students, but ended up only bringing in three. 
“I think we need a chance to grow as a program through the pandemic and not getting a chance seems unfair,” Steinke said.
Steinke’s next steps are getting as much attention as possible from as many people as she can.
“Email your president, email Promise, email your dean, email our dean, email chairs; email anyone you can. These programs are important and they are bringing more people to this school. They are bringing culture to this school, arts to this school,” Steinke said.
Steinke urges the administration who is cutting these programs to listen to the students.
 “Please listen to the student body, please listen to what we have been sending you, please reconsider the freeze,” Steinke said.

Emotional support animals have become increasingly popular among college students in the last few years. The idea of having a pet as means of emotional support, and helping someone get through something, has become more common in recent years.
As of 2019, there were 200,000 emotional support animals in the United States, many of which are dogs. This number is up exponentially since 2014, when there were only 2,400. They are classified as service dogs, since they are used to assist people with their mental health.
When a puppy is trained to be an emotional support animal, the training can take anywhere from 14 to 24 months.
Certain emotional support animals, classified as psychiatric service dogs, can only be obtained by individuals who fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
However, any other person can obtain a regular pet that can double as their emotional support animal.
“An emotional support animal to me is a pet that comforts you through your trials and tribulations. Emotional support animals help with academic stress, as well as depression and anxiety that comes from coursework throughout the semester,” junior theatre arts major Gabriella Beckman said. 
Many college students feel anxiety and elevated stress throughout their semesters, and feel that emotional support animals could help.
Post currently allows students to have emotional support animals. According to liu.edu, “It is LIU’s policy to permit Service Animals, as defined below by the Americans with Disabilities Act, in all approved campus areas; and it may permit Emotional Support Animals (Support Animals), as a reasonable accommodation, in the residence halls for students with a documented disability.”
“They help with stress, anxiety, and just managing emotions,” sophomore nutrition and dietetics major Amanda Battista said.
Emotional support animals can be a tool for anyone who has a psychological disorder and needs an emotional companion, as well as just the average person looking to have a stress reliever in their life.
“I feel as though an emotional support animal could help me tremendously. Whether it be the support animal sensing an anxiety attack, or just taking a break from life to just be with your support animal, it would help,” Beckman said.
Beckman and others agree that emotional support animals should be allowed in college dorms because of the support and aid they can give students.
“I love them. I would say that they should be allowed as long as they are specifically trained to be an emotional support animal,” Batista said. “They would have to go through special training where they are taught to understand human emotions, as well as not bark and disrupt other students in the dorms. I think there should be a separate dorm section for them, and that some sort of doctor’s note should be used as well.”
In today’s age of mental health awareness, emotional support animals are being touted as a tool to help not only the depressed, but also the average person.
“Honestly, the campus should have emotional support animals for everyone. It’s proven that they help people control their emotions and just relax,” Battista said.
With the popularity of emotional support animals continuing to rise, many questions arise, such as how schools will react to and accommodate an influx of students bringing emotional support animals to college with them.
Many also wonder how other institutions will react to people having emotional support animals.
The U.S. Army does not allow emotional support animals on military bases because they are not classified as service animals. However, if a soldier lives in their own apartment, they can have any type of pet they want.
Many questions will arise in the following years about how accessible emotional support animals should be to the public, as well as where they should be allowed. It is up to institutions to decide how these animals should be accepted.

With the NHL just over a month into its season, there have been quite a few surprises, growing expectations for teams and potential new audiences growing in the league. 
One of the biggest standouts so far this season in the NHL is the Buffalo Sabres. Last season, the Sabres traded away their franchise player Jack Eichel to the Las Vegas Golden Knights after contract disputes and disagreements over his surgically repaired neck rehabilitation. 
After this trade, the Sabres turned their focus to a full-on youth movement. Highlighted by their young stars in Owen Power, Jack Quinn and Casey Mittelstadt, the Sabres are currently defying all expectations, as they currently sit seventh in the Eastern Division, just behind the powerhouse teams in the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers. 
In addition to the Buffalo Sabres, another team that has stood out after a month of play is the Philadelphia Flyers. Under new head coach John Tortorella, the Flyers have come out with new energy and have been playing at a high level versus tough competition. Right now, the Flyers are fourth in the very tough Metropolitan Division and have been getting great production from Defenseman Tony DeAngelo, as he has two goals and six assists in 12 games.
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell spoke about these early season surprises from the Sabres and Flyers. 
“I’m definitely surprised by the Sabres and Flyers so far. I thought that the Sabres had potential, but I did not think they would be this good this quickly,” Campbell said. “I expected the Flyers to be awful, but they’re playing well so far. I’m sure that they’ll fall off at some point.” 
Highlighting the two New York hockey teams, the Islanders and Rangers both are off to great starts this season. Right now, the Rangers are fifth in the Metropolitan Division with 15 points, and the Islanders second in the division with 18 points in only 14 games played. 
The Rangers and Islanders are being led by their elite starting goaltending. Reigning Vezina award winner Igor Shesterkin is currently 6-2 with 2.58 goals allowed per game average. On the other side, Ilya Sorokin is 6-3 with 2.20 goals allowed per game. 
In addition, these two teams have some of the most explosive offenses in the league. The Rangers currently have one of the NHL’s top three performers in the month of October with Artemi Panarin, while the Islanders are scoring the sixth most goals per game with 3.6.
Even though the Rangers have a top three star of the month, graduate speech pathology student Ryan Branigan wants his favorite team to add a mega-star into the mix. 
“A trade rumor that’s been popular has been for Patrick Kane. I don’t know if that is the best move given what it would take to get him, but that move would obviously be an exciting one,” said Branigan.
Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks has been rumored as a New York Rangers trade candidate as his time in Chicago is starting to become clouded with a youth movement and contract issues beginning to bubble. With or without Kane, Branigan went on to mention how important this season is for the fans and supporters of the Rangers. 
“The Rangers’ expectations are at least to make the Stanley Cup, if not win it. Anything less than another deep playoff run will be looked at as a disappointment,” Branigan implored. 
Brady Campbell, a fan of the Islanders, also has high expectations for his favorite team. 
“Obviously, there were some things that were out of their control last year, but they were also not good. Most of the core is still here, and I definitely think this team should be a playoff team,” Campbell explained. “They are built for the playoffs, so once they get there, I think they could make a run, but the first important thing is to get back to the dance.” 
Though the NHL season is just beginning, hockey fever is starting to sweep over New York once again, with Stanley Cup dreams in sight.

Letter to the readers,
Not only is the season changing, there ís a new air on campus.  It’s not that fresh cool breeze that slips through your window screens at night either.  Students are a little rambunctious and more energetic than usual this week.  You might have even seen some familiar faces- former students or faculty (cough, cough alumni.)  The athletic teams, especially the football team, have more adrenaline pumping through their veins because this is just any weekend for Post.  It’s Homecoming weekend!!
This is the one weekend that current and past Postonians take the most pride in. Essentially it’s the one time of the year when the entire school really comes together.  Students gather at the pep rally on Friday night.  The residence halls compete for the best and most creative skit, athletic teams are introduced for the seasons, a DJ provides the music and suddenly you are caught up with the crowd that’s singing some song you don’t even know.  But you sure as hell are having a fun time!  Then Saturday comes and everyone watches the football game on Hickox field.  There’s tailgating in the Pratt parking lot, families of students come from all over the states, alumni return to play in athletic games or just to come and enjoy the day with their alma mater!
If you’re a freshmen, than you have to experience this for yourself.  Trust us, this is not an event to miss at Post.  But before we get too carried away, lets introduce the sixth edition of our student newspaper.  Many interesting articles this week; one focuses on the increase of tuition, while one of our editors discusses the two primary candidates for New York governor.  In sports, both the boys and girls cross-country teams traveled to sunny Florida and came back with a few record-breaking times.
As for our arts and entertainment section of Loomings, we are still looking for anyone interested in writing book, movie or game reviews.  Please email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.comÖdonít forget, we are still looking for that 50th email to give away that $500 prize!
From your staff of the Pioneer, Happy Homecoming and good luck Pioneers!

1. It would be cool if you guys can take pictures ofr random students around campus. I know  I would feel good seeing myself in the paperhave a good feeling to see myself in a paper. It creates some sort of a celeb/student status – . kinda like  make an on campus gossip section. I don’t know, it’s just an idea. The 1st edition was great, like all the rest and near future printed papers. Real professional!
Peace

2. Hi Pioneer staff,
If I could change things I’d have articles based more on world news, not just issues that effect the average frat boy. Many students aren’t aware of activities on campus, so doing articles on those clubs might be a good idea at the beginning of the year. However, more detailed articles on our government and current events would be great. Also, while I feel like it’s important that the arts section be expanded and worked upon, the combination of Loomings and the paper is a poor choice. The magazine was beautiful and the picture quality suffers when artwork is printed on newsprint. There is also even less attention on the arts on campus now that there is no publication. It’s too bad that Loomings is understaffed.
Thanks.
Sincerely,
E. Amaral
3. Hello,
I would like to see recaps of professional sports teams in the newspaper. Something about the Jets, Giants, N baseball teams, basketball teams, etc. I think it would be a nice touch to the paper and would grab a bigger audience.
Ps: Tthis is Ppaul from broadcast 25 and I told you I would e-mail you!

5. To “The Pioneer”,
Hello. Recently I read the first the first issue of The Pioneer and saw the ad in the back about “what you’d like to see”; so here I go! I am a currently enrolled Art student at the C.W. Post campus. I would love to do a comic strip per issue of the newspaper on campus life, commuter life and general college life. I think readers would really enjoy “seeing” this in their campus paper. I plan on making it some-what humorous and personal to the school. Please let me know if this is a possibility and I will send some comic strip ideas. Also, if there is ever any need for illustrations or photographs I would love to get involved with that too. 
Thank you for your time!
P. Stewart
6. Im just worried that maybe im so late to send this email 😀
I like the Pioneer a lot. It gives me a lot of opportunities.
To be honest, I know the Pioneer recently because I am an international students and also I did not pay attention to what is going on to the school hahahaha
however, i had a change to be interviewed during the chuseok story.
It was the first time to be in an article and i was so happy with my friends hahaha and we all laughed at my picture.
As an international student, it is easier to read the Pioneer because it is easy to relate to in comparison to the new york times.
In addition, if the Pioneer will add articles about the International students, a lot of them will pay attention! at least I hope so!

Coming off a tough overtime loss to first place St. Thomas Aquinas College by a score of 2-1, the Pioneers came out focused and determined for their next games at Molloy College (3-11) and Mercy College (6-6-2).
C.W. Post won in a 4-1 rout against the last-place Molloy Lions. Later on in the week, the Pioneers faced off against Mercy College (6-6-2), but lost in an exciting double overtime match-up.
“We played well both games,” said forward Rumen Kerekov. “We scored five goals in total in those games and we created many chances. Against Molloy we won convincingly, but we lost in a very unfortunate way to Mercy.”
Right from the start of the game against Molloy, the Pioneers came out energized and ready to play. The Pioneers scored two goals in the first half; one scored by freshman back Joakim Ohlson, and the other by junior midfielder David Carlsson. After these quick two goals, neither team would put up a point on the scoreboard until Molloy’s Dan Brown beat C.W. Post goalie Marco Jorgensen to make the score 2-1 in favor of Post.
Just five minutes after Molloy finally found their offense and came within one goal of tying the game, Carlsson scored his second goal of the game, and his fourth goal of the season. Post continued to pour it on when senior forward Emanuel Messina found the back of the net off a pass from Carlsson to put the game out of reach at a score of 4-1.
On Saturday, the Pioneers traveled to face Mercy College in an East Coast Conference showdown. Post took the early lead on a goal from sophomore forward Betim Bajrami, with the assist coming from Carlsson. Midway through the second half, Mercy would even up the score off a goal from Alex Cruz.
Both teams could not end the game in regulation, so overtime was needed. Neither team could find a way to win at the conclusion of the first overtime, so yet another extra period was needed. In the 104th minute, Cruz managed to give Mercy the lead on his second goal of the game, as this proved to be the final score of a thrilling battle with the Pioneers on the losing end.
“It was a tough loss, but we can still qualify for the playoffs if we beat Queens next Saturday,’ said Kerekov. “So we will definitely be pumped up for that game.”
The Pioneers next game will be at home against Nyack College (5-5) on Thursday at 2 p.m. Saturday, will be their last regular season game, which will be at home against Queens College at 2:30 p.m.

The C.W. Post Pioneers will not extend their season past this weekend. Post will not be involved in a PSAC Championship game. There will be no playoffs. And while the Pioneers outscored the Cheyney Wolves last week, the team may have proven why it won’t be in the postseason.
Cheyney is one of the worst teams in Division II. The team hasn’t had a winning season since 1979. Going back to 1995, the Wolves have a cumulative record of 8-161-1. Out of 151 Division II teams, the Wolves have the 134th offense. Any team should be able to stop their offense.
Go back to last week’s game. The Pioneers defeat the Wolves 63-28. Sure nine touchdowns on offense is a great stat but the defense gave up four. One of the problems with the Pioneers this year is the players’ demeanor on defense. There is no consistency from game to game. One week, the defense is all-world. The next, the squad surrenders points and puts the burden on the offense’s shoulders.
So many times this year, the Pioneers have given up easy yards. For the most part, they have been unable to stop their opponent’s rushing attack. This past week against one of the worst offenses in the nation, the Pioneers watched Cheyney run for 314 yards. Through 10 games, the Pioneers have given up 174 rushing yards per game.
Clearly that type of defense is not conducive of a playoff team. There have been so many instances this season where the defense should have or needed to come up big but fell short. As Coach Bryan Collins always points out to me, football has three phases. And while the offense has done well fighting through injuries, the special teams working through its own issues, the defense has not.
Regardless, there is room to grow for C.W. Post. The defense is full of young players. Donovan Edwards has started at cornerback as a true freshman. Sean Smith was having an excellent year before his knee injury and the vast majority of the starting defense will return next year.
But with one more game left against a solid slippery rock team, the Pioneers have an opportunity to reach seven wins and improve their record from last season. They’ll be in line to win as long as they can play a shutdown defense.

MLB
Texas Rangers closer Neftali Feliz was named American League rookie of the Year. Feliz, who set a rookie record with 40 saves and ran up radar guns with his lively arm.
World Champion San Francisco Giants catcher Buster Posey took the National League Rookie of the Year Award with his impressive season. After being called up in late May, the 23 year-old Posey hit .305 with 18 home runs and 67 RBI in 108 games played.
NFL
The New York Giants took on their arch-rival Dallas Cowboys at home, falling to the desperate ‘boys 33-20. Under new head coach Jason Garrett, Dallas (2-7) displayed grit and determination against a flat Giants team. New York (6-3) looks to rebound next week in Philadelphia against the Eagles.
The New York Jets recorded their second consecutive week with an overtime win over the Cleveland Browns. The Jets escaped last week’s game against the Lions with a comeback in the final minutes of regulation and quick field goal in overtime. This week was quite similar, with Santonio Holmes making a deciding catch in overtime, however this week taking it in for the score. The Jets face off against the Houston Texans on Sunday at the Meadowlands.
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick and company trounced the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football 59-28. Vick, 20/28 for 333 yards also threw 4 touchdown passes while running for 80 yards and scoring two touchdowns. Former Eagle’s quarterback Donovan McNabb, current Redskin quarterback received a $78 million contract extension before kickoff completed 17/31 for 295 yards, connecting for two touchdowns and throwing three interceptions.
NHL
The New York Islanders (4-10-3) have fired head coach Scott Gordon. The team is currently enduring a 10-game losing streak that has left them at the bottom of the NHL standings. Jack Capuano, former head coach for the Islander’s AHL affilate Bridgeport Sound Tigers will replace Gordon on an interim basis according to general manager Garth Snow.
The New York Rangers (10-7-1) defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins Monday night 3-2 in overtime. Rangers’ winger Marian Gaborik returned to action after missing 12 games with a separated shoulder. The team did however lose number one goaltender Henrik Lundqvist to an lingering illness and defensemen Michal Rosival, who has a strained shoulder.

Have you ever considered where graduate students were living this semester? How about the number of graduate students actually dorming? Jennifer Fuoco, the director of residence life, has informed the Pioneer that there are currently 92 graduate students living on campus and that the total number of graduate students living on campus has changed over the years. Fuoco added that, “This number has changed from year to year and is currently up by six from last year at this time.”
Various factors can determine why most graduate students choose to live off-campus.  Sean Manning, a graduate student studying medical microbiology said that “since [he] lives near the school, he doesn’t see the point in living on campus.” Jessica Blumenthal, a graduate student studying social work, agreed with Manning. Blumenthal said that she doesn’t live on campus because she “lives 30 minutes from the school, so for me, it is not worth paying for housing on campus when I can live at home for free.” Although their reasons seem plausible, living on campus can also have its advantages.
Blumenthal went on to say,  “During my undergrad., I was in Maryland and paid for housing, both in dorms and in an apartment, so I already had the experience of living somewhere else.”
The director of residence life also provided a tentative explanation as to why graduate students choose to live on campus. Fuoco said, “living on campus seems to appeal most to graduate students who are enrolling in graduate coursework immediately after finishing their Bachelor’s degrees.  For students who have been out of the residence halls and away from campus life for a year or more, the idea of living in a residence hall, having a roommate, and sharing a community bathroom may no longer be something that works with their lifestyles or schedules.  Some graduate students are also completing their coursework while working full-time and may choose to live closer to their workplace.”
Though living off-campus may be suitable for someone seeking a different experience of being in another environment that is more private and confined, few graduate students agree that living on campus can be an advantage. A graduate student, who wished to remain anonymous, said that when “you live on campus, [you] meet a lot of people and don’t have to deal with all the traffic of commuting, and you get more involved with school related activities. And, living on campus also allows you to work.”
As you can see, there are many things that can influence a person’s choice in deciding whether to dorm or not.  One can agree that graduate students, although one may  think there are none on campus, do make up a significant percentage of the student population on campus. If you still unsure about whom the graduate students are, try networking through the residence halls; you bound to come across a graduate student more quickly than you would think.

C.W. Post students were able to express their Post pride with a Pep Rally on Friday, October 21st, at 7 p.m. in the gym of the Pratt Recreation Center. Sponsored by The Association for Campus Planning (ACP), the Pep Rally had a number of events for students to enjoy.
The night included the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners of the talent show giving an encore of their winning performances. Homecoming banners were proudly displayed, clubs were acknowledged, and the Student Dance Association and Pioneerettes dazzled the crowd with their own performances. And, last but not least, students showed their Post pride to the football team before the big homecoming game. What’s not to love about pep rally?
In addition to the performances, there were also free food and drinks offered to the crowd, along with some green and gold pompoms and foam fingers to cheer with. And, ACP didn’t stop there. It also threw free C.W. Post t-shirts into the crowd and had a D.J. blasting music throughout the event to keep the students pumped up.
Sally-Ann Gaughan, a junior early childhood education major, was surprised by this year’s pep rally. “It was better than I thought it would be. It had more school spirit. It was just awesome.”
Anna Smith, a freshman with an undeclared major, also enjoyed pep rally, saying, “I liked it and thought it was really good. The music was also really good, too.”
This year’s Pep Rally did just what it set out to do: get students pumped up for the big Homecoming game, and allow them to let loose and have some fun.

Conversations Helping and Teaching Stu¬dents, C.H.A.T.S., a program created in 2009, is in the process of becoming an official club at LIU Post. In C.H.A.T.S., an American student and an international student are paired as partners so the two can learn about each other’s cultures and become friends. This gives the internationals students the opportunity to improve and practice their English. 
The offices of International Student Services and Religious Life created C.H.A.T.S. in 2009 and act as co-sponsors for the organization. This semester, C.H.A.T.S. has begun the process of becoming an official club by creating an executive board and attending three Student Government Association meetings. The new executive board consists of five students: Alize Margulis, Rika Tatsukawa, Arti Jain, Terry Chang and Serena Oditt, who will attend the Student Government Association meetings to represent C.H.A.T.S. Father Ted, who is in charge of the Newman Catholic Club, and Jeanette Murray, who works at International Students Services, advise the students. Three coordinators oversee the organization Murray, as well as Trica Figuero and Dr. Leslie Bai. 
“Make another friend; you always need a friend,” said Figuero. C.H.A.T.S. was created to try to build up the connection between international and Americans students. It also serves to improve international students’ command of the English language, allow international students to learn more about American culture, and permit American students to learn about different cultures. This may lead to inviting their partner home for Thanksgiving, and even visiting their partner’s country, said Bai. “International students feel intimidated and lonely. If they find someone who knows American life, they can meet through C.H.A.T.S. first and then become friends later on their own,” said Bai. 
All the C.H.A.T.S. partners are the same gender and are partners for one year. The partners usually meet once a week for about an hour. When, where, what you do and for how long you meet are entirely up to you and your partner. There are also monthly group events for everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. One of the first events this semester was International Friendship Night, which was held on September 20 in the Chapel. The event consisted of games, dancing, food and international trivia. The next event is a presentation on exploring New York on October 11 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. There is an Inter¬national Education Week Dinner planned for November 12 at 7 in the Tilles Center and a farewell party on December 6 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. “The events are open to everyone. We are always encouraging and welcoming visitors and new members, if interested,” said Bai. 
There is an application form which helps with the pairing process. Students fill out their major, hobbies and if they have a preference of what type partner they would like, said Bai. She said last fall there were 50 pairs, last spring there were 39 pairs, and there are currently 27 pairs. However, students join throughout the semester. Students, faculty and staff are all members of C.H.A.T.S. The staff members who are involved in C.H.A.T.S. are Trica Figuero, Dr. Leslie Bai, Jeanette Murray and Nadia Hernandez, who all work at International Students Services. 
“The biggest headache now is there are always more international students then American students,” said Bai. Many international students are waiting for a partner. Bai said new international students are their first priority but returning international students are also waiting. There is a lack of male American students. Many American students are needed and males are needed the most right now, said Figuero. “We have included staff members, and some domestic students take two partners,” said Figuero, to try to solve the problem of not having enough American members. “We try to recruit students at (club) fairs, but it is always hard to get them to commit,” said Bai. 
Bai said many show interest in C.H.A.T.S. while they are recruiting but then they say they are too busy. “Some people are afraid of the commitment; time is an issue,” said Figuero. The coordinators say the group meeting and weekly partner meetings are not mandatory. The events are held so that everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. can get together and do some sort of activity. As long as you are spending individual time with your partner, you do not have to attend the events. C.H.A.T.S. is extremely flexible. “It’s not something to be fearful of or stress out about; just try it” said Figuero. They said they want more American students to learn from this experience. “You don’t have to do something extra; you can bring your partner to something you go to already,” said Bai. 
Being a member of C.H.A.T.S., and acquiring knowledge about another culture, will enhance your resume and work experience as well, said Figuero. Clubs can also pick up partners. Every club on campus has to do a certain amount of hours of community service and earn points for it. If you are on another club on campus and need to earn community service points, you can earn them by joining C.H.A.T.S. If there are a few partners per club, they will give you about half of the points needed. “Internationalization, we want more students to open up, even make our campus a little different,” said Figuero. 
Rika Tatsukawa, a senior Public Relations major from Japan, has been a member of C.H.A.T.S. since September 2011. Tatsukawa was partners with Arti Jain, a junior English Education major, last year. The partners are continuing to work together through C.H.A.T.S. this year as well. “At first, I didn’t expect her to be such a good friend and now I can’t image campus life without her,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she meets, texts and messages her partner often. “I meet Arti at her house a lot, her mother makes Indian food which I love,” said Tatsukawa. She said she went to her C.H.A.T.S. partner’s house for Thanksgiving, her birthday and Christmas. She also said she has met most of her family. “Now I don’t think of her as a partner; I just think of her as one of my friends,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she and Arti have similar feelings to be kind to others and common sense. 
Taksukawa said that C.H.A.T.S. has made her more compassionate to others, especially foreigners. “If I go back to Japan and see foreigners, I want to take care of them and help them because now I know how they feel. Taksukawa thinks that American and inter¬national students can learn a lot from each other. “I wish American students can learn from International students. In the future, it can help them with their work if they know that culture,” said Taksukawa. She said she taught her partner how to say hello in Japanese, “Konnichiwa,” and thank you, “Arigato.” 
Alize Margulis, a junior International Studies major has been part of C.H.A.T.S. since she was a freshman. “I joined C.H.A.T.S. because I thought it was the best way to learn about other cultures and customs,” said Margulis. Her first C.H.A.T.S. partner was Winny Wang, a graduate student from China studying Science Research. She said she found similarities between Wang’s culture and her own. “Winny almost always boils water and drinks the water as such; whereas I would boil water but I would drink it only if I had diffused a tea bag,” said Marguilis.
Last year, Marguilis and her former partner, Kotona Uzumaki, a Business major from Japan, were C.H.A.T.S ambassadors. “We spoke at various C.H.A.T.S. events and were nominated and received certification for Outstanding C.H.A.T.S. Partners of the Year 2012,” said Marguilis. She said her past two partners have become her really close friends. “Kotona, who was studying abroad in the U.S. for one year was in two of my classes , and once we became C.H.A.T.S. partners, we went to various club events on campus and explored off campus too,” said Marguilis. She said she feels she taught her partner how to be comfortable in her home when inviting her over for holidays and dinner. Marguilis said her two past partners taught her many phrases in Chinese and Japanese. She said she and Uzumaki would see shows in the city and at the Tilles Center as well as spend time in her neighborhood. Marguilis still keeps in contact both of her C.H.A.T.S. partners through Skype and e-mail. “I’m hoping to travel to Asia one day, so I know I will be able to explore their countries with them too!” she said.
This year Marguilis is partnered with a student from China named Shuai Shuai, but she has not met her yet. She said she wishes more American students joined C.H.A.T.S. “LIU Post provides this opportunity through the C.H.A.T.S. program, but I feel not enough domestic students are committed or interested in becoming a partner. I understand many students have busy agendas, but how complicated is it to take one hour per week out of your time to meet with some one?” said Marguilis.
She said she has truly enjoyed her experience as a member of C.H.A.T.S. “Inter¬national friends have certain values that we as Americans don’t. I am not bashing Americans, but we should embrace other cultures and be open to learning about them, especially in this globalized business world that we live in today,” said Marguilis.

LIU Post was offered a special opportunity to display President Lincoln’s only surviving handwritten draft of the emancipation Proclamation in the Tilles Center of Performing Arts at the “First Step to Freedom: Abraham Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation” exhibit. The final version of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863, was destroyed in a fire in Chicago in 1871. The draft is the only remaining copy, which led to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom of slaves. The New York State Legislature purchased the draft in 1865 days after Lincoln passed away.
LIU Post is the only Long Island exhibitor of this rare document while it goes on a state-wide tour to mark the 150thanniversary of one of the nation’s greatest accomplishments. LIU Post and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts are pleased and honored to join with the New York State Education Department and SUNY College of Old Westbury in presenting these national treasures to the community,» said Dr. Paul Forestell. Along with Lincoln’s draft, a speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the centennial anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation is also on display next to the draft. 
Students who have seen the historical document expressed their admiration for it. “I think it’s great we we’re able to see a part of history in the Tilles Center,” says Mitch Mark, senior Psychology major. “It’s almost like reliving a part of history and it’s really special.” Matt Aronberg, an Information Studies graduate student says, “It’s amazing how a piece of paper was able to change so much of our history and to make our country the way it is now.”
At the opening ceremony held in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall during Common Hour, Dr. Forestell, Dr. Steinberg, Dr. John B. King, Jr., Andrew P. Jackson and Robert Tilles reminded visitors that freedom and equality hasn’t been reached yet. Robert Tilles explains to those in attendance the segregation on Long Island. “We have pockets of poverty. We drove along the road between the high and low performing [school] districts, and you see people across the street here look at people across the street there saying, ‘how come they get the best education and how come we get the worst education?’”
Both historical documents were on display for the public with free admission on October 15 and 16 from1 pm to 9 pm. The exhibit was offered in partnership with LIU Post, LIU Votes and the Tilles Center of Performing Arts.

The LIU Post football team ended its four-game losing streak by defeating the Millersville Marauders (2-6) on Homecoming by a final score of 20-15. Sophomore quarterback Tyler Heuer started in place of injured sophomore quarterback Steven Laurino, and helped lead the team to a much needed win in front of a packed house at Hickox Field on Saturday, October 20.
The Pioneers (3-4) had no trouble putting up points through the first 30 minutes of play as the team led 20-6 at the half. The highlight of the day took place early in the first quarter when Heuer jump-started the offense with an 82-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Kamron Palmer. Following an interception by senior defensive back D.J. Young, Heuer and the offense were put in great starting field position to do some damage at the Millersville 29 yard line. Senior running back Thomas Beverly capped off the drive with a one-yard touchdown run for his second rushing touchdown of the season.
The Pioneers finally got off to a solid start like Coach Bryan Collins has preached all season long. However, on the first play of Millersville’s ensuing drive, junior running back Ian Sadon busted out a 75-yard touchdown run make the score 13-6 in favor of the Pioneers early in the second quarter.
The Pioneers once again capitalized on Millersville turnovers. Junior outside linebacker Tommy Williams intercepted a pass and nearly ran it the distance for a touchdown. The offense of the Pioneers needed only one play to take a two score advantage as junior linebacker Rob Bright barreled his way into the end zone for a touchdown. With that score, the Pioneers had a comfortable 20-6 lead at the break.
In the second half, Heuer and the offense did not show up as the team did not even threaten to score once during the final 30 minutes. The Pioneers’ defense came up clutch on Homecoming as it forced four turnovers and limited the Marauders to only 15 points all game. Sophomore defensive lineman Joseph Thompson was a game-changer as he led the Pioneers with two sacks, while senior linebacker Anton Rukaj had a team-high 10 tackles.
With the defense playing so well, the offense had to hold onto the ball to avoid the Pioneers losing the fifth straight game. Late in the fourth quarter after throwing his second interception of the quarter and third of the game, Heuer was pulled in favor of Laurino. For the game, Heuer was 11-20 for 113 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions through the air. However, Heuer was efficient on the ground rushing the ball 19 times for 137 yards. With less than four minutes left to play, Laurino entered the game with a broken left hand and a broken right thumb ready to close out a Pioneers win. And he did just that. Despite not throwing the ball once, Laurino had three rushes for 11 yards, protected the ball, and moved the chains to seal a Pioneers win on Homecoming.
The Pioneers have the team’s final home game this week on Saturday, October 27, at 1 p.m. when they square off against the 3-4 East Stroudsburg Warriors.

After 13 months of campaigning, rallying, and debating, Barack Obama will begin his second term in the White House. Although he beat former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in a landslide in electoral votes, he was not as popular amongst all Americans.
According to A CNN article published this month, “Obama takes key battlegrounds to win re-election” by Tom Cohen, Obama won all battleground states as well as Romney’s birthplace of Michigan and his governing state of Massachusetts, with 332 electoral votes. Romney won 206 electoral votes.  Obama needed only 270 electoral votes to win the election. But, Obama did not win the popular vote with such a wide margin. According to the BBC U.S. 2012 results, 50.5 percent of the country voted for Obama while 47.9 voted for Romney, leaving the nation divided.
In Chicago, Obama supporters roared and cheered once Obama’s victory was announced, while television networks showed coverage of Romney supporters somber and crying. Republicans still had hope since Fox News Analyst Karl Rove had reported that Romney might still have a chance in winning Ohio. Shortly after Obama won the battleground state. After Romney’s concession speech, one Romney supporter stated that the fact that Romney lost was “a tough pill to swallow.”
A new Romney appeared on stage, less aggressive and more somber than we’ve seen him in the past months. An hour after news networks projected Barack Obama as victor, in Boston, Romney, whose eyes appeared to be red and watery, conceded, “I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation. The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing. I believe in America, I believe in the people of America.”
In Barack Obama’s acceptance speech, he stated, “Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs – not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together…..We’ve got more work to do.”
Changes promised for students under Obama’s Presidency:
Student debt has reached $1 trillion for the fist time in history. Students will begin to see Obama’s Pay as You Earn program reiterated on certain websites where students can apply for loans. The Pay as You Earn program, which will be in effect in 2013-2014, caps monthly federal student loan repayment at 10 percent of one’s monthly income. This is so students have more money to spend and invest in the economy, according to Barackobama.com. Also, under this program, a student can choose the college they want to attend based on their career goals and not solely on the price of tuition. In addition, if one pays their federal loans on time and at least at 10 percent of your monthly income as a teacher, service person, or doctor, one will be forgiven of federal loans after 10 years. For all other professions, if loans are paid responsibly, one will be forgiven in 20 years.
The Know Before You Owe program is a form that includes loan interest rates while differentiating between grants and scholarships, showing students exactly what they will be paying, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the U.S. Department of Education. The form would also be introduced as a universal Financial Aid document that all colleges would be urged to adopt by the 2013-14 school year. This would allow students to see what they are being offered and how much they could possibly pay, before they accept the offer to attend that school. President Obama also insured that veterans and service members would be able to get a college education and find work when they return from service by implementing and expanded the post-9/11 G.I. Bill, according to BarackObama.com.
He also proposes to make higher education institutions more affordable, even though a written bill has yet to be written out and plans lack details, according to “With Obama’s Win, Colleges Anticipate 4 More Years of Reform,” by Michael Stratford in Chronicle.com this month. According to WhiteHouse.gov, the official website of the White House, Obama stated, “Higher education is not a luxury. Earning a postsecondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs.”
The President will be inaugurated for his second term on January 21, 2013 in Washington D.C.

	Hurricane Sandy and the nor’easter that followed caused LIU Post to close for a total of 11 days, including weekends. In order for students to complete their fall 2012 courses in full satisfaction with the New York State Education Department requirements, missed classes will have to be made up, according to Beth Carson, who works in Registrar. 
	New York State mandates a specific amount of contact (instruction) hours, explains Carson. For a three credit course, there must be 2,250 minutes of contact hours not including out of class work.
	The rest of the fall semester’s academic calendar has been revised as well. Make-up classes for the hurricane will be scheduled on Fridays, Saturdays and during common hour. It will be up to the professor to determine which days and times will be used. Wednesday, December 12, will be a mandatory make-up day for classes. 
	Classes that were cancelled due to the nor’easter will be made up as follows: evening classes cancelled Wednesday, November 7, will be made up on Saturday, December 15. Classes that were cancelled on Thursday, November 8 (2pm and later), will be made up on Thursday, December 13. Classes that were cancelled on Friday, November 9, will be made up on Friday, December 14. Faculty will be responsible to confirm all make-up sessions, times and locations with their students.  
	Final exams will now be held from Monday, December 17, until Friday, December 21. 
	The extra classes have been reported to add stress on some students. Jacob Maitland, junior business major, said, “I’ve had two rescheduled classes and one that really did me in.” Because of some scheduling issues, his parents are visiting him the week after Thanksgiving instead of during the break. His law class was rescheduled for a Saturday when his parents would be visiting. He said he reacted with “a lot of beeps, hash tags and stars.” The class is also expecting an exam that day. Maitland said that it was too personal to reveal his professor’s name; however, the professor allowed him to reschedule the exam for a later date so he could spend the extra time with his parents. 
	“Students should speak with faculty regarding any conflicts that they have with scheduled make-up classes,” Carson said. She added that if there are additional concerns made by the student that cannot be resolved by the faculty then they should speak with their chairperson or dean. 
Some students understand the need to make-up classes. “It was a whole entire week of classes, that’s a lot of days missed,” said Joe Nicastro, junior criminal justice major. He added that it’s better than extending the semester. 
	Natalie Post, freshman finance business major, said, “Mine didn’t bother me, but if I had a Friday class, I might be mad.” She normally works during common hour and did not mind missing one day of work but still referred to it as money coming out of her pocket. 
Softball players Kaci Hopkins and Nicole Hagenan, both criminal justice majors, were relieved that they did not have any rescheduled classes that interfered with practice. Their Earth Science class was rescheduled for common hour. “I’d rather have it at common hour because people have jobs and practices to go to,” Hopkins said.
Other universities fulfilled their missed days differently. St. Joseph’s College eliminated finals week to have more classes and Stony Brook University professors were just told to consolidate the course material and added no make-up days. 
“We can’t speak to how other colleges are choosing to fulfill their contact hour obligations. Additionally, not all Long Island colleges were closed for the same lengthy period that LIU Post was due to the consecutive storms,” said Carson.

If you ever meet stranger with light brown hair who smiles and greets you with a friendly “hello” on campus, it just may be Information Studies grad student Matthew Aronberg, who has one of the most important jobs here at LIU Post.
Matthew is captain of Post’s Emergency Medical Services. He has been working for the school EMS for the last four years and is a licensed EMT.  Being an EMT runs in the Aronberg family. His parents worked on ambulances and wanted Matthew to gain experience in the medical field, which led him to become an emergency medical technician. Luckily, the school offers full time students who are licensed EMTs a position on the EMS team and tuition remission for those who apply. Matthew started working for the school during his second year of his undergrad career as an Information Technology major in 2008. “Balancing my time was hard when I was an undergrad,” explained Matthew, “but now it’s not so bad since I am used to it.” His daily routine at the start of his shift involves checking the ambulance to make sure all supplies are in order and the equipment is functioning and going on calls. Matthew said that most of the calls that the school emergency services gets are medically related all over campus, with a few traumas every now and then. Due to the HIPPA Privacy Act, Matthew can not go into detail on what the emergencies entail.
When asked how he manages working the overnight shifts, he jokingly responded with his eyes closed and “lots of coffee.” But all joking aside, Matthew admitted that those late night calls are usually emergency calls. “Calls in the middle of the night are definitely the hardest,” Matthew said.
Matthew not only works for Post EMS, but he also works for other ambulatory agencies when school is not in session. “Working on campus is very different,” he said. “Patients at Post are my peers that I go to class and live with.” Even though his job is to make sure these students get to the hospital safely, he tries to make friends with his patients so the route to the hospital is more pleasant and less awkward for the patient. Matthew finds working for Post EMS is an “amazing opportunity” because it is a great way to network and meet new people. “People are always interested in what I do when they see me in uniform or when I’m driving the ambulance around campus,” Matthew explained. “Working off campus, you tend to deal with random people and you definitely get a larger amount of calls.”
Matthew is graduating in 2012 with a Master’s Degree in Information Studies. He explained that he would “probably recertify for another three years” to continue his E.M.T. career, but after those three years, chances are he “will be working on a career with computers.” Nancy Aronberg, Matthew’s mother, gushed: “I’m proud of Matthew and all that he’s accomplished with his EMT career, but I know that he would be happier behind a computer screen helping to educate other people on today’s technology.
For aspiring students who want to be a trained emergency medical technician, Matthew advises them to “study hard and pay attention to small details in class” and to volunteer with ambulatory agencies to get some experience before working for an agency or for the school.

LIU Post’s Association for Campus Programming (ACP) had students hyped and anxious for Saturday’s homecoming with a week full of exciting events. Homecoming is a week dedicated to welcoming back alumni and also a time for current students to have fun, socialize, and partake in school pride. The week is very important to Post students for many reasons, and this year’s homecoming proved to be a success.
Jeremiah Aviles, sophomore Childhood Education major, said, “Homecoming is the core of LIU Post because it’s the anticipation of a crazy weekend.”
Main Events
Some of the main events were the pep rally, the homecoming carnival, the homecoming party, and the biggest event of the week was the homecoming football game.
The pep rally was held in the Pratt Center on Friday, Oct. 18. It was an enjoyable time for students to demonstrate Post pride and kick off the weekend. The pep rally consisted of performances by the Post dance team, cheerleaders, residence halls, and DJ S. Whit. The rally was also used to introduce LIU’s soccer, volleyball, swim, and football teams.
There was free food and Post giveaways for all guests. The Pratt was packed and the atmosphere was electric.
Alfred Cabera, sophomore Business Management major, believes that homecoming is the most popular school event throughout the year. “It’s the biggest social event of the year. Everyone participates in homecoming, even people from other schools,” said Cabera. “It’s a chance to meet your peers in a different environment.”
The Homecoming Carnival was a magnificent experience for students, families, and guests. The carnival was held in the Pratt and at Hickox Field at noon on Saturday and continued until 4 p.m.
Admission for the carnival was $15 and included a ticket to the football game and a barbeque lunch. There were rides, games, and club tables with promotions and activities.
Student Thoughts
Jesus Cardenas, senior Business and Film major, has always been excited and anxious for homecoming. “Homecoming has always been a time to take a step back from work and have fun with new and old friends,” he said.
“I’m excited about this year because Post is in a remodeling stage and we can make this the biggest homecoming and start new traditions with a new name,” he added.
The Homecoming Party is an annual celebration held on Saturday night for all LIU Post students and their guests to enjoy. The party has usually been held in the basement of Winnick, but this year it was moved to the Pratt Recreation Center to allow room for a greater audience.
Admission to the party was $5 for students and $10 for guests. Student Life, ACP, and a combination of student clubs and organizations hosted the party. The festivities were well attended and the venue was decorated with LIU Post colors and flashing lights.
Teresa Lisbet Ndong, sophomore International Business major, believes that this year’s homecoming was better than last year’s. “There were more fun activities this year, people seem friendlier, and everyone was having a great time together.”
Football Victory
The most important event of all is the homecoming football game. It’s the most anticipated event of the week, and the most popular. The LIU Post football team the Pioneers brought their “A-game” with them as they shutout Pace University in a 58-0 victory.
“I knew we were going to win, we were focused and ready to demolish Pace,” said Matthew Ferere, a sophomore defensive back for the Pioneers.
Homecoming 2013 was a great weekend for Post students to relax, have fun, and take a break from schoolwork just for a little bit. Most students enjoyed themselves and the Pioneer’s victory helped boost everybody’s energy.

Throughout his monthlong show on the streets of New York, the famous graffiti artist known as Banksy has turned the city into a giant game of treasure hunt this October.
Unveiling a new art piece on a daily basis, Banksy communicates with the public through social media and his website, banksyny. com. Posting only a picture of his recent work, and the located area, he leaves it up to New Yorkers to find the exact location—and they do.
People are getting swept up in the hype that is Banksy, and rush to see his art work before it is defaced. The mysterious artist, who remains unidentified to public, calls his monthly exhibit “Better Out Than In,” meaning that art is better on the streets where it is free rather than in a museum.
Banksy challenged authorites with his first piece. On October 1, he painted a kid standing on another kid’s back, reaching for a spray can inside a sign reading: “Graffiti is illegal.”
LIU Post students are captivated by Banksy and his mischievous work. Broadcasting students Rob Hairston and Karoline Onsrud defines graffiti as a visual way of seeing people’s thoughts, thus being art and a way of expression. “Graffiti is more accepted these days,” said Onsrud. “It started as vandalism, but it has developed into an impressive art form which is much more accepted these days. Banksy sends political messages that concerns all of us look at how his work makes all these people flock together!” she added. The British street artist has gone from being a cultural icon in the graffiti community to the name on everyone’s lips.
He wins his audience over with political and social messages, as well as creativity. There is often a double meaning behind his work. However, regardless of Banksy’s increasing popularity, graffiti is still looked at as an illegal action. Or is it?
Banky’s work has forced a new debate about the definition of graffiti. What started out in the ‘70s, with young people tagging their names on buildings and such, has evolved into a form competition with each artist “out-doing” each other.
Banksy has become a living example of how graffiti has expanded its limits. CBS New York reports that his drawings are being protected by plexiglass, and in some cases even by security guards.
The whole meaning behind graffiti has transformed from something that used to be an illegal action into becoming a legal way to make big money.
While certain building owners jump with joy when finding Banksy’s valuable paintings on their property, the NYPD and Mayor Bloomberg are less than enthralled by the brazen acts of the artist, according to CNN. “Graffiti ruins people’s property and is a sign of decay and loss of control,” Bloomberg said.
Despite Banksy leaving his marks all over the city, the NYPD is having a hard time finding him. The search after the elusive artist is still ongoing by law enforcement.
Although not legalized by law, there’s no doubt that Banksy’s work has opened people’s eyes to see graffiti as something more than just vandalism.

LIU Post’s new boutique, located in the old gaming lounge in Hillwood, attracted faculty, staff, and students to its grand opening, Nov. 12.

The anticipation was high as guests waited for the special ribbon cutting, which symbolized the official debut of Post’s first student-run store. Contrary to what might be expected at a grand opening, no food or refreshments were served. However, that didn’t stop the boutique from filling quickly with intrigued students, faculty and professional photographers.
“This boutique is a great way for students to gain hands on experience, and to become entrepreneurs,” said Christina Principato, a senior Accounting major, who works at the boutique.
Nicole Balnis, a sophomore Social Work major, was excited when it came to revisiting the boutique in the near future. “I think it’s pretty nice, and I like that it has nice clothes, that I can definitely see people wearing,” Balnis expressed.
Tamir Dayya, manager and representative, spoke out about the interest, the boutique’s aim, and its progress from the earlier stages. “We had the boutique up and running, from the ground up in two weeks. Everyone from the facilities, to President Cline helped us out. It was true, genuine, teamwork,” said Dayya.
“The whole point is to get the students to run it, so they can learn about executive choices, and envelop themselves in management that can be fun, but also hard work,” Dayya said when asked about the boutique’s purpose on campus. “Thus far, we’ve gotten nothing but positive feedback, and we are very proud of the work we’ve done up to this point,” he added.
“I think it’s a good idea but I don’t know how many students it’s really going to bring in as customers,” said Stephanie Morales, a sophomore Art Therapy major. Morales had a notion that the boutique would definitely draw in various eyes from every direction, but she was unsure if the interest would stay alive.
“Everyone that I’ve spoken to about it, hasn’t shown any real excitement, or interest about it,” she added.

With rumors of major changes coming to LIU Post within the next six months, the semester’s first Town Hall meeting, held by the Student Government Association (SGA), was a necessity, both to dispel and clarify all the speculations.
The Town Hall meeting on Wednesday, Nov. 13, was an open forum, which allowed Dr. Jackie Nealon, the university’s new chief of Staff; Dr. Abby Van Vlerah, the new dean of Students; and Alerie Tirsch, the director of Student Life, to answer questions from attending students about a wide range of topics, such as campus life and the rumored changes.
There have already been some big changes since the new President, Dr. Kimberly R. Cline, took charge of LIU on July 1, including the opening of a new student run clothing store and the restructuring of certain administrative areas of the school, including Admissions and Academic Advisement.
On the subject of rumors, Nealon quickly squashed the question that a Shake Shack was coming to the campus.
There has also been an overwhelming worry around campus that tuition would be raised, which could mean added financial strain for many students. However, Nealon stated that Cline has promised no more than a two percent increase in tuition until 2020, compared to the average of over six percent.
The Apple Store that is rumored to be opening in Hillwood is not going to be an Apple store. However, it will be a tech store that is licensed to sell Apple products, a rare affiliation that only a few academic institutions can claim to have, stated Nealon.
This tech store is also going to have a tech support bar, something students can take advantage of if they are having any kind
of computer problems. The Student Art Gallery is will be possibly used as a shared space, perhaps with another student run business similar to the clothing store. The Center for Student Information (CSI) is going to be used for another purpose, possibly another student run business, but no plans are set in stone as yet, which means no more printing in CSI, something that could raise concern among commuter students who use CSI for their printing needs.
“I often use the printing facility in CSI as a quick option as I am passing through Hillwood on my way to class. I hope that there will be an alternative printing facility that is convenient,” said Andreas Olsen, a graduate Political Science major and commuter student, who attended the Town Hall meeting.
With the Gaming Room already moved to the upstairs study lounge, there was worry among students that
the Recreational room, also located upstairs in Hillwood, would be made into something else, therefore diminishing the amount of study space in Hillwood. However, Nealon assured students that there are plans to revamp the Recreational room, making it a better facility for students.
“There is already limited space for commuters to study during common hour; allocating space for this seems essential for a commuter school, ” said Kristina Renberg, a senior Public Relations major and commuter student.
An interesting discussion of proposed student run businesses for Hillwood was also held. One hundred percent of the profits from these businesses, according to Nealon, will go straight back to the students, with 50 percent going to scholarships and 50 percent to the school’s capital fund, which will be spent on other improvements for students.
For the students who live on campus, a hot topic at the Town Hall meeting was the Winnick Dining Hall, and the major question was, “Will the food change and get any better?” Van Vlerah said, “Paul Carroll, the director of operations for Aramark FoodSservices, is willing to work with students to cater to their needs. We encourage students to take to resources like the SGA food committee to help communicate what it is they want.”
Brianna Pisano, a freshman and member of SGA, who attended the meeting stated, “Dr. Nealon often reassured the students of their worries by explaining that they want to expand access to study resources and entertainment all around campus rather than just in Hillwood.”
The Town Hall meeting, which was held in the Cinema during common hour, didn’t have a large attendance. However, for students it was an interesting and necessary meeting that began to bring clarification on a range of topics.

A Mexican Christmas celebration called Los Posadas was celebrated on campus, on Wednesday, Dec. 5. In Spanish, Las Posadas means “the inns” or ”the lodgings” and represents the Biblical journey of Mary and Joseph as they searched for a shelter in Bethlehem before the birth of Jesus.

“This is the Catholic event on Christmas season,” said Father Ted Brown, the chaplain at LIU Post’s Interfaith Center. “From nine days before to the Christmas Eve, Latin American Catholics do this custom every night,” he stated.
Traditionally in Mexico, people gather in a neighborhood home to have a party each night from Dec. 16 to 24. Children get dressed as shepherds, angels, Mary, and Joseph. An angel leads the guests carrying candles to the house—in this case, a dorm. They sing a carol to ask for shelter, and then the host sings a reply regarding their request. After that, guests are welcome to have a party. They end the party with a pinata shaped like the Christmas star. The last day of Las Posadas is on Dec. 24, which is followed by midnight mass, the celebration of Jesus Christ.
People who took part in the custom gathered in the campus chapel, and then the journey began. Students played pilgrims who traveled from house to house searching until they reached a designated home where Las Posadas would be celebrated. First, they made rounds to each dorm, carrying candles with them. When a group of around 15 students reached each dorm, they sang a carol such as “Joy to the World.” After going around the dorms, they went to the Interfaith Center, which is regarded as the shelter, and decorated the chapel.
“I came to join this because it sounded fun,” said Aimee Biernacki, sophomore Healthcare Administration major. “It is a good way to come together with other students, so I want to come back again next year,” she added.
This was the fourth celebration for Matt Mason, senior Criminal Justice major. “As it gives me [a sense of] community, I came to this since I entered LIU Post,” he stated. Mason added that he would have wanted join this seasonal custom even if he weren’t a Catholic.
“Originally, Las Posadas is a Catholic custom, but it is not only for the Catholic on campus” said David Armas, junior Sociology major, who is the vice president of the Newman Club Catholic Community, LIU Post’s Catholic student organization. He continued, “Las Posadas this year was really successful. Many people stayed [until] around 11 p.m. to decorate the chapel.”
The Interfaith Center is currently decorated with a Christmas tree, along with green and red lights. The decoration was done by those who took part in Las Posadas.

This fall, there have been incessant complaints from students about the shortage of food at Winnick Dining Hall, as well as the low number of staff members working at Winnick, which, according to diners, is causing delays and difficulties when it comes to servicing students during meal times.
Students have reported that they have to wait in long lines with bad service, and that they aren’t provided healthy options, or even fresh food. “The only options there are [at Winnick] are hamburgers and pizza and the salad bar is usually stocked with lettuce that has been left out and is brown,” said Melissa Nosel, a junior English Library Science major.
Winnick’s hours have also caused some grumbling among students. Nosel says that Winnick doesn’t open until 7.30 a.m. However, like many students, Nosel has an 8 a.m. class. As a result, she is unable to get breakfast before her classes begin for the day.
“The one station that I love is the pasta station and it is closed half the time to keep open the pizza station because they don’t have enough staff to run all of the stations,” Nosel said. “There are six or seven stations, and most of the stations are closed because there is not enough staff to run them. The lines are out the door because they have one worker at each station trying to feed thousand[s of] students at [a] time, especially during common hour. I can’t count the amount of times that there were no utensils, no cereal, and the vending machines were broken.”
The lack of healthy options poses a problem for some students, especially those with medical conditions that make them unable to eat certain foods. Stacie Palacino, a senior Child Education major who underwent surgery to remove her gallbladder, has been forced to eliminate fats and gluten from her diet. Palacino claims that Winnick told her that they would accommodate her dietary needs, but there are still not a lot of healthy options and the salad bar is never stocked.
Ultimately, Palacino made the decision in Fall 2012 to become a commuter because of the lack of dietary options provided for her in the dining hall. “[Living on campus] just wasn’t working,” said Palacino. “I’m much happier now. I can make my food from home and I know that I’m eating healthy foods that I can eat, and not the greasy foods [that were provided for me at Winnick].”
Paul Carroll, Director of Operations of Aramark, the food service provider at LIU Post, states that there are no staff shortages at Winnick, and certainly no food shortages: “We currently have no [worker] shortages at Winnick Hall with the exception of some weekend coverage that is generally covered with student workers,” said Carroll. “We have 55 union members at Winnick Hall, and [many of them] are long-term union members who have served us well. We have no future plans of any change.”
Carroll also stated that the complaints of food shortages are unfounded. “We currently have the same amount of stations open as last semester,” Carroll said. “This includes pizza, pasta, street food, grill, home zone, dessert, salad bar, vegetarian-yogurt bar, deli, continental breakfast and cold food setup. There are no plans currently to change any food options, however we did introduce two new meal plans for commuter students.”
Resident students are used to using the magnetic stripe on the back of their student ID card in place of using cash to pay for food. LIU has instituted a brand new meal plan for commuter students that provide them the same food services as resident students. When a full-time commuter student uses their student ID card, they will automatically receive $50 to get them started. Commuter students will be able to choose from a 25 Block Plan, which provides 25 meals per semester and 50 dining dollars; a 50 Block Plan, which provides 50 meals per semester and 50 dining dollars; and the Commuter Dining Dollar Plan, which allows students to add more dollars to their plans at any time.
Despite this change, resident students believe that commuter students will only face the same problems that they do when it comes to the food selection and services.
“I’m cutting down my meal plan next semester,” said Nosel. “I have a meal plan for three meals a day, and yet I don’t use it most of the time because there is no food there a lot of the time and bad service.”
There are students who feel as though most of their dietary needs are being met with only little complaint or concern. “Overall, it could be worse,” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. “If I avoid the chicken then I’m usually very happy.”
The Pioneer was unable to receive a comment from Administration; Abagail Van Vlerah, the Dean of Students, referred Jackie Nealon, the Chief of Staff and Vice President of Enrollment, Campus Life, and Communications. Nealon chose not to comment on the matter, but referred to Aramark.

Over the past couple of semesters, more and more students have been attracted to Hicksville for off-campus housing, causing an everyday struggle for students to board the free shuttle, which has a 25 person occupancy limit, to school in the mornings. As a result, the Office of Campus Life and the Student Government Association have worked together to improve transportation—and more options are underway.
Students, faculty, and staff are taking advantage of the shuttle services, and the same hours seem to appeal to them all. “9.00 a.m. is by far the busiest time,” said Ian Jonson, a freshman undeclared major who lives in the Hicksville area. “I’ve been at the bus stop 20 minutes before the shuttle is supposed to leave, and you could tell straight away it wasn’t enough.”
The excessive demand for the crowded morning shuttle buses leaves students with two options: to go hard or to go home. “Lines have been non-exist[ent], and those getting a spot on the bus have usually been those with the sharpest elbows,” Jonson said. Instead of taking the risk, Jonson and his housemates have given up the extra hour of sleep, and are taking the 8 a.m. shuttle instead to make sure they don’t miss class.
Recently, the Office of Campus Life and SGA have studied the issue, and together worked on changes to the shuttles. “Along with the SGA, we constantly monitor the transportation needs of our students and make changes accordingly,” said Abagail Van Vlerah, Dean of Students.
“Van Vlerah and I actually rode [the shuttle] last week sometime in the afternoon, to get feedback from students,” Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, added.
The changes already in place have not increased the amount of rides to and from Hicksville; the latest round that used to leave campus at 9 p.m. has been taken away, and the shuttle is now going at 1 p.m. instead, breaking the previous almost six-hour break the shuttle used to have between 10:20 a.m. and 4 p.m.
“It is an expensive and year-round service, so we have tried to play around with the schedule before increasing any costs,” Berthel said. “SGA has allocated over $100,000 for the student shuttle service during the 2014-2015 academic year,” he added.
For those who dorm and don’t own a car, the off-campus shuttles to Hicksville and Pathmark in Greenvale have been the only free alternatives to leave the campus. “During weekdays, I try not to take the shuttle after its break in the afternoon because I know it will be completely full of commuters,” said Tine Markar Lolland, a junior Public Relations major. Lolland explained that the weekends are the only times she does not have any problems.
To facilitate leaving campus for on- campus students, the university will launch a new Zipcar program on Wednesday, Oct. 22, which will allow students to use an on-campus rental car all hours.
The Zipcar project is a global car- sharing network with operations at other college campuses throughout the U.S. Any student over 18, faculty over 21, or community member who has been a licensed driver for a minimum of one year (international licenses accepted) can apply. After registering online, and paying the annual membership fee ($25 for first year), students can reserve a car at any time of the day. Over the first month, students will be discounted for their first $35 driving dollars, according to William Achnitz, Campus Life Coordinator and Sustainability Coordinator. The rental will take place outside of Post Hall.
Jonson believes it is only fair to give the residents another option to leave campus; however, he wants to see some action taken on the free Hicksville shuttle, as well. “The shuttle is a service offered by the school, and you can’t offer services unless you can guarantee all those wishing to utilize it will be able to.”
Berthel stated that he understands where the frustration with the shuttle service comes from. “Students definitely have reasons to complain,” he said.
“The services are paid for by university and student funds, ultimately coming from student activity fees.”
SGA and Campus Life are considering further changes to the shuttle service that may affect the university wallet moving forward. “We are looking into a bigger bus,” Berthel said. “We are also thinking about moving the bus stop from the Chapel to the Humanities area where most departments are located; this way, students will get dropped off closer to the classrooms.”
However, Berthel warned students not to expect major changes any time soon. “Be patient. It is not going to happen overnight.”

As The Pioneer reported on Sept. 30, the LIU Post equestrian team set out to complete a daunting mission—raise enough money to rescue a slaughter- bound miniature horse, and make him the team mascot. The team held a bake sale during common hour in Hillwood Commons, posted flyers throughout campus seeking donations, and even created a web page on gofundme.com so that others could donate money to pay for the purchase and future expenses of the miniature horse.
After a lot of hard work and dedication, the girls were finally financially able to travel to the horse auction located in New Holland, Pennsylvania and choose which lucky horse would be coming home with them for another chance at life as their team mascot.
The mission took place on Oct. 13. Hope, a sweet palomino mare, caught the riders’ attention right away. Two of the three team captains, Cristina Bakos, a senior Speech Pathology/Pre-Med major, and Alex Diez, a junior Biology major, as well as one of the fundraisers, Christina Cepeda, a junior Psychology major, brought the mini horse to her new home in Bakos’ backyard barn in Nesconset, where she will have a much more exciting life with the other mini horses—and a donkey—already living there.
All of the money raised by the team will be put towards the many expenses needed to properly care for any horse, including veterinary and farrier appointments (hoof trimming), board, feed, wormer, shavings, and clothing. Hope had a warm welcome to the LIU Post equestrian team when she made her mascot debut at the annual Homecoming Football Game on Saturday, Oct. 18. For such a tiny equine, Hope handled the loud, crazy football game quite well. She tried her best to not get too overwhelmed.
“She was calm at homecoming, but would sometimes get startled with sudden, loud noises like popping balloons or the loud music, but eventually she got accustomed to the all the noise,” said team member Colleen Dreyer, a senior Public Relations major and the team’s Treasurer.
The day at homecoming was a success, which even included raising more money to care for Hope in the future. The equestrian team raised $1,110 through their “Go Fund Me” account, which is linked on the team’s Facebook page. To donate money to help Hope, you can go to www.gofundme.com/save- a-pony, or email christina.kotarski@my.liu.edu or christina.cepeda@my.liu.edu.
The next on-campus horse show at the North Shore Equestrian Center will be on Nov. 9, at 8 a.m. Hope, the mini mascot, will be there to show support. The event is open to the public.

Trailing 31-21 in the fourth quarter, the football team (7-3) scored 14 unanswered points on Saturday, Nov. 8, to storm back and defeat Bentley University (4-6) on Senior Day, 35-31, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
On their opening drive of the final quarter, LIU Post started at their own five-yard line. Bentley had complete control after scoring 24 unanswered points. However, red-shirt senior signal-caller Steven Laurino scrambled for five yards on the opening play from scrimmage, followed with 13- and 22-yard completions to red-shirt sophomore wideout Shane Hubbard and red-shirt senior wideout Kamron Palmer. The series resulted in a 16-yard touchdown pass up the seam from Laurino to junior tight end Sean Binckes, making it a 31-28 game.


Two possessions later, Laurino anchored another offensive assault. After starting at their own 47-yard line, Laurino completed four consecutive passes to set up shop at the Falcon seven-yard line. A few snaps later, the Boise native took a three-yard keeper into the end zone at the 2:41 mark to regain the lead for the hosts, 35-31.
With 2:34 remaining on the clock, Bentley looked to spoil the Pioneers’ rally. Graduate quarterback Danny Guadagnoli methodically drove his squad down to the LIU 25- yard line. Following back-to- back misfires through the air, Guadagnoli hooked up with Jet Kollie on a seven-yard strike to make it fourth-and-three. With only 16 seconds left and the game on the line, the Pioneers defense got one final stop as sophomore defensive lineman Kenny Scotland channeled his inner J.J. Watt and swatted away the fourth-down pass to secure the victory.
The Green and Gold got out to a hot start, as they scored on their opening series of the game. Laurino scrambled for a two-yard score at the 8:11 mark. In the early stages of the second quarter, the Pioneers capitalized off a Falcon turnover as Laurino hooked up with sophomore tailback David White on an 8-yard touchdown pass.
Heading into halftime, LIU Post held a 21-14 advantage. However, the third quarter belonged to the visitors as they gained their first lead after putting up 24 unanswered points.
That set the stage for another Pioneer comeback and Laurino’s late-game heroics. Laurino finished 34-of-48 for 363 yards and three touchdown passes. The fifth-year senior also ran for 74 yards and two touchdowns. Hubbard and Palmer each caught eight passes and accumulated over 90 yards receiving. Red-shirt senior wideout Chris McGrane had a stellar outing, catching seven balls for 92 yards. Binckes recorded five receptions for 45 yards and a pair of touchdowns.
The Pioneers defense saw red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti lead the defense with 13 tackles, while red-shirt senior defensive lineman Dan Belfiore had nine tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a forced fumble. Red-shirt sophomore defensive back Justin Ortiz chipped in with six stops and two pass break-ups.
The Pioneers earned the right to play for the NE-10 championship on Saturday, Nov. 15. LIU will make the trip up to Springfield, Massachusetts for a re-match with American International. In their regular season, the Green and Gold were defeated by the Yellow Jackets 27-24. The Pioneers will be searching for their first NE-10 title since 2006. Kickoff is set for 1p.m.

LIU Post has announced that it will introduce two new schools to campus for the 2015- 2016 academic year: The School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering, and the Honors College. Jeffrey Kane, Vice President of Academic Affairs, believes this reorganization will increase enrollment, and be beneficial to the overall academic environment on campus.
The School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering will be an independent academic unit that will join the School of Business and the School of Professional Accountancy within the College of Management. Prior to the reorganization, the College of Management consisted of the following departments and schools: the School of Professional Accountancy; the Department of Social Work; the Department of Public Administration; the Department of Criminal Justice; the Department of Management; the Department of Finance; and the Department of Marketing.
However, the administration began to notice that certain academic units, such as the Department of Social Work, the Department of Criminal Justice and the Department of Administration, didn’t seem to fit within the College of Management, according to Kane. “These very disparate group of units couldn’t be called the School of Business because you can’t include Social Work as a part of the School of Business. You can’t call Criminal Justice a part of the School of Business. As a result, they created an umbrella term called the College of Management. However, the problem with that is that it created a lot of confusion on the outside,” Kane said. One of the reasons for the creation of the School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management was to expand on areas of growth and development such as computer science, according to Kane. “One of the main objectives [of the reorganization] is for students to realize that we do have Computer Science at this university. If you look at the Department of Labor statistics and look at the area of growth in the job market where our students can get really good and professional careers started and developed, there’s a heavy emphasis on computers. There is a tremendous growth area in the job market for this new school will initially be small, but he stated that his goal for the school is for it to grow, and ensure that students have careers ahead of them that “will serve them well and make them happy and productive people.”
“I’m fine with the idea as long as it doesn’t interfere with my graduation date,” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. However, according to Kane, the new school will have no impact on individual students because it will not change the already pre-existing courses or the majors offered on campus. “If you’re in accountancy, then you’re still in accountancy. If you’re in business, then you’re still in business. If you’re in social work then you’re still in social work. None of this has an effect on the program that you are enrolled in,” Kane added.
Project Management, a new program that will be offered in the fall in the new school, is a graduate level program now at the approval stage. A degree in Project Management will give students the skills to oversee all aspects of a project, including planning, budget, project control, strategic issues, value management, human resource issues, and legal issues.
The establishment of the Honors College will give LIU more prominence, attract more students, and promote the academic environment on campus that is devoted to students and their academic needs. “I believe that we have one of the finest honors programs in the country,” Kane explained. “When it’s called a program, it seems to have a lesser status than, let’s say, the honors colleges at other universities. It gives the appearance, although a misguided appearance, that the program here is of lesser significance. We want to promote that program and raise recognition of the role that it plays at the university.”
“I feel very positive about this because [it] is a direction that many universities across the country are taking,” said Joan Digby, a Professor of English and the Director of the Honors Department. “It makes us more competitive to be a college rather than a program. I think that it will even encourage students that are already going to Post to apply to be in the honors program, knowing that their diploma will read that they graduated from an Honors College.” Digby continued, “My primary goal is to expand the number of students in the Honors College because that will permit us to offer more courses and advanced electives every single semester. I’d like to try to get an additional 100 or 150 people by next fall so that there [can be] more course offerings.”
Starting in the fall, when Honor students graduate from Post, their diploma will state that they graduated from an Honors College, according to Digby. Honors program students will automatically be moved into the Honors College next fall. The Honors College will keep the same reporting schedule, and will not be structurally different; however, students will have more opportunities being a part of an Honors College rather than an honors program. Digby predicts that as the Honors College at Post develops in connection with LIU Brooklyn’s new Honors College that Post and Brooklyn will have more programming together.
“It might mean that our Pre-Pharmacy students might want to take some courses at the Honors [College] at the Brooklyn campus, or other students from Brooklyn might want to come do a semester to concentrate on Theatre or Music at Post, where we are very strong,” Digby said. “The benefit of all of this, that as a director of a college, I’ll be able to work more directly with the deans of the other colleges so that I will have more input in terms of getting faculty to teach an honors course, and getting faculty to advise research for honors students.”
“If we can be more successful in letting people know what we have, then hopefully we can attract students from different regions, [and] not just the local area,” Kane said. “A dream of ours at the moment would be to open up an honors dorm.”
This fall, the Honors office was moved from Humanities building to room 202 in the Winnick Mansion. Kane believes the change of location of Honors from Humanities to the Winnick Mansion displays great symbolism for what it represents to the university. “Just look at the new location. It’s on the top of the hill in [the] beautiful Winnick Mansion. It promotes the message of, ‘Hey we’re proud of this thing.’ It’s not one program among many. It’s the gleaming top.”
As of now, a dean has yet to be appointed for the School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering, and there is currently no deanship for the Honors College. Dr. Digby will remain the director.
“You can think of these changes as a statement of our aspirations. The real impact is telling people what we aspire towards and what we aim to do in order to move the campus forward. It’s more a picture of where we want the campus to be rather than an administrative shuffling like it might appear to be,” Kane said.

Sean Brogan, who graduated from LIU Post with a B.F.A. in Film in 2011, has become a novelist. Brogan launched and self-published his first book on August 12, and is already hard at work on a sequel.
Brogan’s first book, ”The Shadow’s Relic,” a 400-page adventurous saga set in the late 1700s, was inspired by fantasy genres like the Harry Potter and Star Wars series, written with a cinematic imaginary for details. ”The Shadow’s Relic” is the first of a four to five book series, with number two—The Mechanic of Death—expected to be launched for the second half of 2015.
In the first novel, a killer who distrusts the idea of the recently united thirteen colonies uses his telekinetic abilities to steal a powerful weapon from the American government and build an army of dead. Kaie Ellinger, an assassin with origins unknown, and Curtis Reynolds, a former prisoner with superpowers, work together to protect the colonies from the awakened deadly creatures. But will they catch The Dark Warrior before he launches his final plot: to cull only the strong and worthy from his wake of death and destruction?
“I always loved film and still do, but I have such an active imagination that writing lets me go the places I can’t go in film right now,” Brogan said. “But I think studying film challenged me to think visually.” Brogan hopes to build an audience strong enough for the series to later become one for the movie theaters. ”While writing ”The Shadow’s Relic,” I was able to imagine it very colorfully in my head, and I could play the chapters in my mind like scenes in a movie,” he added.
The idea of storytelling came about during a screenwriting class with Professor Michael Atkinson in the Film Department at LIU Post. Brogan described being stacked with eight-page assignments every week as tough, but valuable, in his creative writing. ”It’s really nice to experience that freedom in taking a story wherever you want to go,” he said.
But Brogan’s first book did not start off in much of a red carpet setting. ”I worked full time at a Chipotle during the course of the book,” Brogan said. ”In order to stay on track, I’d have to clock out after every shift, take my computer into this back room we had, and just keep myself awake long enough to write a chapter—or even a paragraph.”
The writing process took him around nine months. But once he found the rhythm—and chapter one was over with—it remained pretty painless, according to Brogan. Editing was more challenging to get through, as he spent a year to review every little detail together with a hired freelance editor.
The decision of self-publishing ”The Shadow’s Relic” gave Brogan total freedom to attribute creativity in his writing. He uses a handful of characters. While they are all overshadowed with some sort of mystery or superpower, he reveals the source of actual people to be the most fundamental in his writing—including himself. ”I think you need to put a little of yourself into your characters,” Brogan said,  revealing that he wrote Sean Brogan, the series’ main hero,“a bit” after himself.
Self-publishing comes with more responsibility to control everything around the actual release. The traditional publishing market these days is competitive if one does not already have an audience, according to Brogan. He therefore relies on his website and social media accounts to grow support.
A free excerpt from the book, background information of the main characters, and contact information to the author can be found at www.shadowrelic.weebly.com. The book can be purchased in both hardcover as well as paperback version on www.lulu.com.

Now that summer is over and it is officially fall, it is time to put the shorts and flip-flops away. The change in weather means there is a change in the clothes we wear, the trends we see, and the drinks we find to be popular at Starbucks.
For those who try to stay fashion forward, it’s important to know what’s trendy this season. “Fall is the best time for fashion,” said Monica Peralta, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “It is just starting to cool down; you can layer, layer, and layer, without looking weather confused.”
“There are a lot of fun new trends this fall. Shift dresses, sock boots, pajama dressing, patchwork, and new Victorian pussy bows are the hottest trends right now,” said Stephanie Adelson Bray, a junior Fashion Merchandising major. “This season we are seeing a lot of fringe, a lot of burgundy, and a lot of suede,” Peralta added.
“The color I’ve seen everywhere and a color that I really like is olive green,” said Jawaan Smith, a senior Arts Management major. “From pants to jackets, it’s a great color.” While there are new trends every season, some trends are timeless. Fringe, military style, layering, neutrals, velvet, and bohemian are just a few of the trends that will be carried over from years before, this fall, according to Bray.
Fashion for men tends to be overlooked, however, both Bray and Peralta made sure to include trends that men can totally rock this fall. “They should focus on layering,” Bray said. “3⁄4 zip sweaters, a button down under with a skinny scarf and a vest.”
“We are also seeing a lot of Monochrome happening,” Peralta added. “Which is super easy to pull off.”
Fall, to some, is also known as the season of pumpkin spice everything. Starbucks officially has their famous pumpkin spice latte back for the season. “I have yet to fall under the magical spell this pumpkin spice has put every girl in the world under,” Peralta said.
“Pumpkin spice kind of unofficially announces the beginning of the fall season,” Smith said. Bray agreed, but added, “Pumpkin spice isn’t bad, but I think there’s too much hype. A classic chai latte and caramel macchiato will do the job just fine,” she said.
To help those who don’t understand fashion trends, Bray and Peralta both gave some of their “must haves” for the season. The boyfriend jean, over the knee boots, plaid scarves, black booties, turtle neck sweaters, and duster coats are some of Peralta’s recommendations for women this season. Bucket bags, velvet booties, and fringe skirts are a few of Bray’s must haves this season.
For men, Peralta suggests: joggers, khaki denim, light denim, wool topcoats, chukka boots, bomber jackets, and brown leather sneakers. “Everyone must get their hands on a pair of beige Nike Air Max Thea Leather Sneakers and Adidas classic superstar sneakers,” said Bray. Smith suggests that everyone should own a pair of black jeans, colored pants (burgundy, navy, olive), and brown boots.
“Every season is a great season for fashion. You make it the way you want it to be,” Bray said. “There are limitless amount of options to wear in the fall. Personally, it’s my favorite time of the year to dress up.”

People might think that Greek life is all about the parties, cliques, and frat houses, because movies portray them that way. However, this isn’t the movies, this is LIU Post. At this university, there are no fraternity houses or cliques, but Greek life is a “community of students who are initiated into one of our recognized fraternities or sororities,” said Katherine Wieme, Director of Greek Life & Student Involvement, a position in Campus Life.
Wieme explained that it offers students opportunities to bond, strengthen leadership qualities, and network with alumni. There are 11 fraternities and sororities on campus: Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Delta Zeta, Phi Sigma Kappa, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and Chi Nu Alpha.
“We currently have over 250 students in fraternities and sororities,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life. “We are proud to now be home to some of the largest national organizations in the world and are excited to add Sigma Delta Tau to our community in the spring
[2016].”These organizations are not all the same; they have different recruitment processes, structures, and types of councils. The three types of councils are the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Association, or the Multicultural Council. Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Phi Epsilon, and Delta Zeta are Panhellenic sororities. Tau Kappa Epsilon, Phi Sigma Kappa, Theta Chi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon are fraternities a part of the Interfraternity Council. Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Tau, and Chi Nu Alpha, are the fraternities and sororities that belong to the Multicultural Council.
“Being in a cultural organization differs from other organizations because we’re very passionate about our organization’s history and the meaning behind the letters; we take pride in the roots of where we come from,” said Richard Batista, President of Phi Iota Alpha, and a senior adolescence education major in mathematics. Batista also explains that one thing you learn is that you should “never forget who you are and where you come from.”
Each fraternity and sorority has a philanthropy that they partner with. “In DZ [Delta Zeta], we raise money and awareness for our philanthropy Speech and Hearing, to try to make a difference in other people’s lives,” said Nicole Cunningham, President of DZ and graduate literacy education major. Their philanthropy focuses on those that are affected by speech and hearing challenges.
“Engaging in community service projects and raising funds and awareness for various philanthropic organizations are fundamental components of being an active member of a Greek organization,” said Alexa Regina, President of Alpha Phi Epsilon, and a senior social work major. She mentions that AEPHI “values service, which has allowed me to give back to the community with the help of my
sisters.”It can be hard to find your place in college. Now that doesn’t mean your clique or “it” group, but a group of people that help you find yourself and enjoy your college and life experience. Greek life can help “students to find their home in a fraternity or sorority,” Wieme said.
“Joining Greek life is so important because when you join your org, you are also joining a community,” said Giovanna Domingo, Financial VP of Alpha Xi Delta, and sophomore accounting major. “Over the last year I have seen such a positive change in Greek life. Even if you don’t know a person and you’re wearing letters, you always have something to talk about because there is that common thread.” She explained that more people have joined, which has shown such a positive growth.
These organizations have made an impact on many students and the campus itself. “Joining Greek life has without a doubt been one of the best decisions I’ve made in college. It’s gotten me way more involved than I ever was before on campus and it’s equipped me with invaluable leadership opportunities,” said Jawaan Smith, VP of Phi Sigma Kappa, a senior arts management major. “Also, knowing you have 20 plus guys who always have your back and are there for you through your highs and lows is a great feeling. It’s definitely a rewarding experience.”
“We are proud that our Greek Life students are also active in student organizations, residence halls, athletic teams, and student run businesses,” Wieme said.
“Being in Greek life means being involved, but still the most important job is for you to be a student. The hardest part about Greek Life is time management,” according to Michael Aquilano, Programing Director of Phi Sigma Kappa and sophomore psychology major.
“When you join Greek Life, you become a part of something that is very active and you need to learn or already have time management skills. Especially if you want to hold and E-board or chair position,” he said.
Wieme explained that the Office of Campus Life serves as the primary advisor to Greek life, including all the governing councils, organizations, and individual members and that they support the growth of these organizations. Campus Life “maintains a Greek life expansion policy for any organization who is interested in becoming recognized on campus,” she said.
“All of our organizations are national with chapters across the country,” Wieme said. “Post students who join a fraternity or sorority will have the opportunity to attend conventions, network with alumni, and meet fellow members from other institutions.”
Berthel added that Campus Life, and the university fully support the fraternities and sororities. “Providing opportunities for students to take part in Greek life is very important to us and we will continue to look
for ways to grow and strengthen our current organizations and add new organizations,” he said. If you think Greek life is for you: go out and meet the different organizations during Greek week or Greek events, which are held every semester and maybe you’ll find your new home.

How many “selfies” does it take to settle on the “perfect” picture? How many times have you posted a “fire” picture onto social media, but your peers didn’t reciprocate (like the photo), so you deleted it? Although the players remain the same, the games and the rules of which the players play by, have changed ten-fold.
Once upon a time, well, really before all of these social media sites, we would look at each other on the Starbucks line, and make our judgments from there. However, “We now look at the person’s Instagram first, make our first judgment, and then we take it from there,” said senior history major, Kathy Rice. “I can name 1,000 times where some guy would like [my posts] on Instagram, I guess showing interest in
me, but then in person, no social contact, none whatsoever,” she added.
When Rice told me this story, I literally, “loled,” but this really is no laughing matter.
Let’s me ask you again, why does it take 200 pictures to get that one perfect selfie?! To be honest, folks, I think I have that answer. The mini photo shoot we partake in when we want to post a picture on social media is caused by something I would like to call, “Social Perfection,” a.k.a delusion.
I believe that social media is driving our youth to the brink of insanity as it causes them to feel the need to to “qualify” within their respective social groups. For example, Marcella Anteri, a Suffolk County High School physics teacher, recalled a story about one of her students and social media.
“One of my juniors, who will remain nameless, came to me at the end of class,” said Anteri. “That class, she did none of her physics homework, and totally bombed my quiz. She came to me, and before she could say anything, tears began pouring from her face.”
Anteri later revealed that her student’s disarray stemmed from her fear that she was being judged off of her social media posts. According to Anteri, her student told her, “I accidentally liked my friend’s ex-boyfriend’s picture, and they’ve been ignoring me all week.”
We all know being in high school can come with its times of social hardship to say the least, but if you think about it, social media just adds to that fire we deal with in our adolescent years. In the age of social media and texting, misinterpretation and cyberbullying have run rampant. It has led Mike Kurtz, a junior education major, across the street at NYIT to stop texting all together.
“You really wouldn’t believe how many fights [with friends] I’ve gotten into because I didn’t answer a text within three minutes, or reply ‘lol’ instead of replying ‘lmfao,’” Kurtz said. “I remember one time where a girl I was dating told me a joke, at which I replied [over text], ‘lol.’ She later texted saying, ‘I haven’t liked your attitude all day and that last text proves you’re giving me one right now.’”
“I never texted her back after that, because I knew where it was going to go,” said Kurtz. “If I have something to say, or want to talk to you then I’m just going to call you. I’m bringing back the phone call!”
Social media to me is a synthetic form of human interaction; a form of interaction, which in most cases that does us more harm than good. Yes, social media links us beyond the classroom and to each corner of the Earth; however, Instagram, Twitter, even Facebook, and Snapchat, have become portfolios, or as I’d like to call them, “baseball cards” to track our latest social undertakings, misleadingly presenting them to our peers.
Posting a picture of your lavish vacations, the new car, your selfie, taken from an angle that probably led you to sprain your wrist and shoulder, and not to mention your “following to followers ratio.” Social Media allows us to portray ourselves in our “best” light, and that’s great! What if social media just further enhances the saying “perception is reality,” in a world where everyone’s perception of each other is derived of social media. It makes me wonder if we are losing our authenticity, and that’s kind of scary. Well, too scary to me at least.

To the Editors of the Pioneer:
On Wednesday, I posted a response to the excellent letter Editor Caroline Ryan published in the Pioneer. In my post, I expressed admiration for the clarity of her argument, and sadness that a student newspaper faces such deplorable conditions in trying to report campus news. This stance of complete message control on the part of the administration is antithetical to the concept of academic freedom and freedom of the press. It is demoralizing to the student journalists and heartbreaking for faculty members who work with them. It also makes our journalism program a hard sell to potential students who want the experience of working on a vital and relevant paper, not a University Public Relations mouthpiece, and discover that cannot happen here.
I am writing this letter as an addendum to my brief Facebook post (which seems to have disappeared) after learning that copies of this week’s Pioneer seem to have been removed from the campus before visitors to Homecoming and the Admissions Open House could grab them. This has happened before. It also happens at the Brooklyn Campus. It is shocking to see this go on in a campus community. I am appalled that our administration thinks this approach is somehow beneficial to our university, when in fact it does damage to all of us.

Two of the five deans of the schools and colleges on campus are interim, acting deans. One was appointed earlier this year and the other was appointed last week. Only one of the five deans has been in place for more than a year.
On Oct. 6, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane, sent a campus-wide email stating Dr. Albert Inserra, the former president of Dowling College, has been appointed dean of the college of education, information and technology. Inserra replaces Louisa Kramer-Vida, who was the acting dean of the college of education, information and technology.
Vida-Kramer is the chairperson of the department of special education as well as an assistant professor in the department. She was approached to take the position of acting dean in mid-June 2016, and began the position on Jul. 1. Kramer replaced Dr. Barbara Garii, the former dean of the college of education, information and technology, who became the vice president for academic affairs of St. Joseph’s College on Jul. 18.
As the Pioneer reported in its Oct. 5 issue, Jeffrey Belnap, the dean of LIU Global, has been appointed the acting dean of the college of liberal arts, succeeding chemistry Professor Nicholas Ramer, who was the acting dean of the college from June 2015 to August 2016. Ramer replaced former Dean Katherine Hill-Miller, who stepped down from the position in 2015 and returned to her position as a professor in the English department.
Art therapy professor, Christine Kerr, became the acting dean of the college of art, communications and design on Sept. 1, succeeding Noel Zahler, who left the University in August.
Stacey Gopack, who was the acting dean of the School of Health Professions last year, is the newly appointed permanent dean of that school.
Only Robert Valli, the dean of the College of Management, has been in his position since 2015.
Some students have expressed confusion and frustration about the coming and going of the deans. Senior economics major Marvin Johnson has had positive experiences with going to deans for help throughout his academic career. Johnson feels that with many of the deans stepping down and the administration constantly needing to find new replacements, many students may begin to feel lost. “Some students have a unique bond with certain deans and by them switching up and resigning, it just makes the students feel not wanted,” Johnson said. “It’s like a puppy with a new owner.”

What does it mean to be a woman? Where and when did the concept of womanhood come to life? The answers to these questions can be found on the stage in PTC’s production, “Age of Elizabeth.”
Follow modern Elizabeth and her mother’s story of betrayal and her journey through a timeline of mother-daughter relationships in past generations of her family, and the lessons that were passed down by each; discover how the trials women had faced in the past impact the future and define womanhood.
Written and directed by Logan DeWitt, the idea for “Age of Elizabeth” arose from a topic of discussion on nature vs. nurture within DeWitt’s household, where she is the only biological child of seven. DeWitt started to question learned behavior to search for the reasoning behind womanhood.
“I started writing it about a year ago,” DeWitt said. The script is still changing and transforming as the actors go through the workshop and rehearsal process.
The cast consists primarily of women: five Elizabeths, following the usually male tradition of passing down a name, and one man who plays every male character within the show.
DeWitt wanted to center the focus on the women of the play, as opposed to the men, an attempt to pass the Bechdel test. The test identifies the roles of female characters within a play or film based on three questions: whether they are named, interact with other female characters, and talk about anything other than a male character. In the entertainment industry today, many films fail that test. This pushed DeWitt to have a female-driven show.
“It’s really interesting being in this specific show,” said Cayla Michael, sophomore musical theatre major playing as modern Elizabeth. “There are a lot of things that she (Elizabeth) goes through that is personal to me and other people in my life.”
An overbearing and involved mother pressures Elizabeth, an issue that Michael sees reflected in some of her friends. “It gives me a sense of what they must have gone through,” she said.
With all of the focus on content and meaning throughout the play, the set itself is made to be simplistic in a fair contrast. Containing a single chair, three hanging frames to serve as time dividers, and walls on the sides covered in photos, the set establishes a place in time without drawing too much attention from the messages of the story.
What DeWitt wants is for the audience to examine the relationships they have in their own lives and what messages they are sending to one another through their interactions, especially for women. “Are we building one another up,” DeWitt asked, “Or are we subliminally tearing one another down?”
“Age of Elizabeth” will be showing at the Rifle Range Theater on Oct. 28-29 at 8 p.m. and Oct. 30 at 3 p.m.

On Wednesday, Nov. 9 professors and students joined together to express their feelings about the presidential election by holding a sit-in during common hour in Hillwood Commons.
“The idea behind the sit in was to come together and find positivity and togetherness on a day that wasn’t so happy for most of us,” said Alexandra Mitchell, a senior musical theatre major. She didn’t want to call the event an anti-Trump campaign.
“It was a Pro-people sit-in where we wanted the students of Post to know that no matter who you are, what you identify as, and where you come from, you are important and your voice matters here.”
Taylor Bass, another senior musical theatre major, also partook in the sit-in. “It was a tough day. All of my classes were like funerals, both the students and teachers were in tears,” she recollected. “The majority of my peers are having their rights challenged by Trump’s presidency. It put my heart at ease to know that people were thinking the same thing as me and were just as scared as me.” Although the sit-in was peaceful, Public Safety and Dean of students Abagail Van Vlerah stopped by to make sure everything remained calm.
“I think the biggest part of this movement is that we do not emulate the behavior of our president-elect,” Bass explained.
“We will no longer tolerate those using his platform for violence. We will not be silenced by his presidency just because he isn’t fighting for us, we will fight for ourselves and for our rights as human beings in this country.”

After a five-year absence from the big screen, J.K. Rowling brings audiences back to the world of Harry Potter with her new movie, “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.”
Taking place in 1926 New York instead of modern-day England, the film is a prequel to the Harry Potter series and contains Rowling’s first screenplay. While she is the author of the Harry Potter books, Steve Kloves and Michael Goldenberg wrote the screenplays for the movies.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” was originally published as a book in 2001, Rowling used the name Newt Scamander, who is the main character of the movie because the book was published as the actual textbook used by Harry Potter in the novels. The movie is not based on the book like Harry Potter was, but is an original story crafted by Rowling.
This is the first of a five-film franchise planned by Rowling and Warner Bros. studios that will see the series stretch from 1926-1945 and will include pivotal characters such as Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore and dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” stars Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander; Katherine Waterston as Tina Goldstein; Dan Fogler as Jacob Kowalski; Alison Sudol as Queenie Goldstein and Colin Farrell as Graves. Ezra Miller and Jon Voight also play supporting roles.
Newt Scamander is a wizard who travels the world collecting different types of magical creatures and stops by New York on his way to Arizona. While in New York, his creatures are accidentally set loose and he must enlist the help of witches Tina and Queenie Goldstein, sisters who work at the Magical Congress of the United States (MACUSA), and non-wizard Jacob. Together they must return to find Newt’s creatures while avoiding the detection of Percival Graves, the Director of Magical Security at MACUSA.
A strength of the movie is the performances of the actors, particularly Eddie Redmayne and Dan Fogler. Redmayne easily takes the franchise reigns from Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe and anchors the Fantastic Beasts series behind his performance. He successfully portrays Newt’s insecurity around humans and is able to contrast that aspect of his personality with his more outgoing nature while spending time with his creatures.
Fogler is able to take what could have been a typical side character and elevate him to one of the core characters by the end of the movie. While Fogler’s performance originally starts out as comedic, he becomes more reserved and sympathetic as several emotional moments throughout the movie revolve around his character.
“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” also benefits from being written by J.K. Rowling instead of a screenwriter unfamiliar with the world she has created. Her imagination is so expansive that there is no shortage of interesting characters and creatures throughout the movie. Rowling even includes several references to the Harry Potter series and other material not in the books.
There are very few things holding this movie back from being perfect. While all of the main characters are fleshed out, some of the secondary characters are relegated to the sidelines, in particular, Jon Voight’s and Carmen Ejogo’s characters. The movie can also seem busy at some points with several plot threads occurring at once. While this should be expected from a first-time screenwriter, it is not a main issue as Rowling was able to successfully accomplish this while writing Harry Potter.
Since the last Harry Potter movie was released five years ago and the last novel nine years ago, it was possible that interest in Rowling’s work had dwindled and that “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” would underperform at the box office. However, backed by Redmayne’s leading man performance and Rowling’s unique storytelling, the movie has made its budget back at the box office and has successfully started a new franchise. The movie is now playing in theaters.

Nov. 14 was in many ways a Monday like no other. Still reeling from perhaps one of the most tumultuous, momentous and historic elections in the history of American politics, Post’s theatre majors began their weekly retreat back to the classroom.
However, most, if not all theatre majors attending the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building that day were shocked with inspiration when they saw what was waiting for them on the chalkboard in the west wing of the building.
An anonymous creator left a platform for theatre majors to put their dreams into writing, for all of campus to see. The creator has yet to claim responsibility for the mural.
“It’s a board where everyone can talk freely about anything,” said Sabrina Ali, a freshman theatre major, who also works as a receptionist in the department of theatre, dance & arts management. “It’s completely anonymous, it’s us being ourselves.”
With her hands folded, Ali gazed at the mural and said, “We want to be free, and this wall is our outlet.” According to Ali, the mural only began with the words ‘Before I Die, I want to…” and since then, this outlet has grown every day, consistently, by the hour, with each student and one dream at a time.
While Ali was speaking, three students passed by the mural and one contributed, writing what she wishes to accomplish before her time comes: “Make Mom and Dad Proud.”
The mural of motivation has no names, signatures, or any other form of identification. Regardless of whether it’s an image, quote, or simply just a word, this mural allows members of the student body to peacefully and properly display their thoughts, their emotions, and their perspective.
“We seem to learn a lot more about one another when we reveal ourselves to one another,” said Jacob Lackey, a freshman undeclared major. “I think the mural humanizes us, and in a digital world, we sometimes lose touch of that.”
With no plans to remove it, the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building mural currently remains untouched, located on the old chalkboard in the west wing of the building. Students who wish to view and/or contribute to the mural are welcome to do so as long as reverence is shown for classes that may be in attendance.

At 11:05 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 17, the office of Public Safety sent an announcement via email and text message notifying students and faculty that the library would be closed for two days. According to the notice, “the library will be closed effective immediately and will reopen Thursday, Oct. 19 at 12 noon. Efforts are being made to relocate the afternoon and evening classes that were scheduled in the library to other campus buildings. Class relocations will be posted at the library’s entrance. Updates will be emailed through LIU email.” The notification did not state the reason for the closing of the library.
In response to the Pioneer’s inquiries, Head of Public Safety Michael Fevola stated in an email that the library was closed because of wasp infestation. “LIU Post Facilities Staff and a contracted exterminator located a bee’s nest in the attic of the library and took immediate action to eradicate the nest and protect the health and safety of the public. The exterminator began professional treatment to remove the nest and treat the building. The treatment requires that the building is vacated for 48 hours.”
Faculty members with offices in the library were unexpectedly displaced due to the library’s unplanned closing. Classes were reassigned to rooms in different buildings. The Information Technology department was temporarily moved to the Browse store in Hillwood Commons. IT has “spread over what available space we have; they are utilizing the work room and the desk they already have for daily use. So far we’ve adjusted pretty nicely,” Albert Donor, a senior broadcasting major and Browse store associate, said.
Shaireen Rasheed, a professor of education, was the last professor to leave her office when she got word of the library’s wasp infestation. “I just took everything out of my office that I need for the next two days,” she said. “I’m trying to make a makeshift office wherever I can find wifi.” Rasheed has office hours set up for students to visit, she’s been holding meetings in Hillwood Commons. She had to post-pone a Skype meeting due to the lack of privacy available. Rasheed had just enough notice to remove her important belongings from the library so that her work has not been adversely affected by her removal from her office.
According to Fevola, rooms are reserved in Hillwood Commons for students to use as quiet study and computer space. Students who have questions regarding their classroom location may contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299- 2800.
Although the original notification informed students that the library would reopen at noon on Friday, Oct. 20, students did not receive a notice that the library had reopened until 2:13 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 20. The notice sent by Public Safety via the LIU Alert email system, stated that the library had reopened, thanked the community for its patience, and informed students and faculty that the library had resumed normal operating hours.
During this three and a half day library closure, students had to find other places to study, have internet access, and print out work. They were unable to take out books or use the library’s reference services, other than by email. Dean of Students Michael Berthel informed students by email that the library maintained virtual reference services to answer reference, catalog, and database questions via post-ref@liu.edu.
“The library faculty did a great job maintaining the online chat reference and email reference services,” Thomas Walker, associate dean of the college of education, information, and technology, and director of the Palmer school of library and information science, said. 


Students received no further notifications regarding the measures taken to remove the bees.

“Additional precautionary measures were put in place to ensure the continued safety of the community,” Berthel said.

On Friday, Oct. 13, the day before Homecoming, students were surprised to find 25 new yellow bicycles spread out across the campus, with multiple bikes chained to bike racks in front of Post Hall, Brookville Hall, the library, and between Nassau and Suffolk Halls.
Students received an email from President Kimberly Cline later that day, explaining that the new bikes had many uses, “whether it is rushing to your next class or squeezing in a quick workout.”
Students were expected to follow an “honor code,” according to the president’s email. Students were given the code “1954,” to unlock bike chains and to use the bikes at their own pleasure on campus, free of charge. Unfortunately, within days of their introduction to the campus, bikes were missing or damaged. Some bikes were hidden around campus, or taken into buildings and rooms to keep other students from being able to ride them. Another instance that occurred included the use of a personal lock to chain the campus bike.
Scott Carlin, the director of Center for Sustainability, is delighted that the administration offered on-campus bicycles to students.
Several years ago, students in the department of Earth and environmental science explored several alternative bicycle options for the campus. “Student research included working with third-party companies that manage and maintain the bicycles, [create] bicycle paths on the campus, and working to make sure that bicycles, pedestrians, and cars can share the campus safely,” Carlin said.
Carlin went on to say that it is not unusual for new bike programs to experience growing pains, and posed the same questions many students are asking. Should students be able to borrow bicycles anonymously or should they need an ID to borrow them? What happens with at tires and other maintenance issues? Who will be responsible?
Campus Life did not comment on the misconduct with bikes on campus. “We are excited to hear the initial feedback about the bike program. Students have been riding bikes around campus and we are happy that the program has been such a success,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said in an email. His email goes on to state, “As with any new program, we are constantly evaluating to determine future improvements and enhancements.
Students who have feedback regarding the program are encouraged to contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299-2800.”

At 6:57 a.m. on a rainy Monday morning, Oct. 30, an announcement was sent via email and text message to students and faculty notifying them that all Monday classes would be cancelled. According to the notice, “due to a power outage, all classes at LIU Post are cancelled for today, Monday, October 30. Faculty and administrative offices are closed. For Tilles Center call 516-299- 3100. Library closed.” Many parts of Long Island had lost power due to the heavy rains and winds throughout the night on Sunday.
The university sent a second email, an hour later, to inform students what services would be open on campus. “Public Safety, Facilities, Dining, and Campus Life staff are fully prepared to service the campus throughout the outage,” the email said. The shuttle bus service to Hicksville was operating on a regular schedule. However, the only available dining option for students was Winnick Student Center, which operated on an extended schedule from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Campus Life staff held activities to keep students occupied during the day, including bingo and Monday night football in the Winnick Student Center Gold Coast room. Members of the campus life staff and resident assistants were available in the residence hall lobbies throughout the day.
Michael Berthel, dean of students, confirmed the buildings affected by the power outage. “On Oct. 30, several buildings on the LIU Post campus were affected by a power outage due to an off-campus issue. As a result of the outage, most academic buildings, the Pratt Recreation Center, Library, and Hillwood Commons were operating on emergency power,” he wrote in an email responding to the Pioneer’s inquiries. “LIU Post Facilities coordinated with PSEG to address the issue and return power to the campus. Without being able to open essential buildings, the decision was made to cancel classes for the day,” he said.
Sam Scarito, a freshman early childhood education major, lives on campus. “The power outage was pretty inconvenient for me. Post Hall was out for the majority of the night, and people were in the hallways doing their homework.
I wasn’t able to set an alarm and I honestly wondered if I’d wakeup for class or not,” she said. Notification of the school closure was sent via text message and email at 6:57 a.m., when many commuter students and professors were already on their way to their 8 a.m. classes. Jamie Leigh, a senior forensic science major, was driving to her 8 a.m. class when she got the notification. “I usually do not check my phone while I am driving but I had my phone propped on my dashboard while using a navigation app. I feel like this happens all the time. The school should know a significant amount of students commute to school and should have taken into consideration how far some students commute. One hour before the first set of classes is not enough time to notify students,” Leigh said. Freshman accounting major Amanda Norton was an hour into her commute to school. “I think they should’ve sent that message earlier. It’s dumb to wait until 7 a.m. when there [are] commuters with early classes who are already on the road. I wasted my time and gas,” she said.
Michael Semler, a junior international business major also leaves early in the morning to get to classes on time but feels that this power outage could have been prevented. “[The university] should make sure that anything at risk, like equipment servers, [are] secured and contingencies should be in place when equipment fails,” he said.
The Pioneer has previously reported on hurricane preparedness. In “Storm Preparedness In the Wake of Hurricane Nate,” By Jada Butler in the Oct. 10 issue, the Pioneer reported that many buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the event of a power outage. “Several buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the case of a power outage, those being Pell, Hoxie, Roth and Kahn Halls, Humanities, the Winnick and McGrath Houses, Hillwood Commons, the Pratt Recreation Center, the Little Theater and Theater & Film building, the Tilles Center, the library, and all in-use residence halls,” according to the Oct. 10 article. “All other buildings, including the Chapel, the music and sculpture buildings, the Fine Arts Center, and Lorber Hall are equipped with backup emergency lighting.”
According to Berthel, the outage was not caused by an on-campus issue. PSEG, the electric provider for Long Island, was responsible for repairing the power lines to restore power to campus. Power was restored at approximately 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 30. Classes resumed on Tuesday, Oct. 31 on a regular Tuesday schedule. Students have not received any notification about whether the Monday classes will be made up.

Despite the chaos in the world and reports of prejudice in the news, many minorities in the United States – blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and others – are excelling academically in college and thriving in life generally. Too often, we forget the contributions they make in our communities, socially and culturally. It is disappointing to see the rage that they experience when still being labeled as the minorities in our multicultural society. Students often feel stigmatized when labels are placed on them, often because of their socio-economic status. Many overcome the labels, however, soar through this issue and lead by example. Blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities in our communities should not feel like outcasts, because all lives matter.
Pablo Correa, the 2016 salutatorian of Hempstead High School, is a sophomore at Dartmouth College. Although he is undecided about his major, he is leaning towards anthropology, with global health and chemistry minors. He is also on the pre-med track. Before entering college, he was actively involved in his high school, serving as Vice President of the Hempstead High School class, Vice President of Club Truth, President and Refounder of Future Doctors of America, and more. Correa, who was born in Colombia, came to the United States when he was four years old. As high school came to an end, he became determined to face the next chapter of his academic career with determination and excellence. Yet, he felt like an outcast during the college application process. “I can’t say for sure that I have experienced racial profiling, but I have felt like an outsider in many different situations, most of them here at Dartmouth or when I was visiting other schools like Princeton or Cornell,” he said.
Correa has encountered moments when he felt uncomfortable sitting in class in college because he was the only racial/ethnic minority in the room. Yet, he has not allowed this to deter him from academic success. Correa continues to go to events on campus and he makes it apparent that he is a low-income, first generation college student. Correa became actively involved in Dartmouth’s First Year Student Enrichment Program. This program enables first-generation students to become used to the college environment. With the help of the director of the program, he became acquainted with the resources Dartmouth has to offer, which helped him in his transition into the new environment. Correa’s mother reminds him to ignore the connotations placed on him because of his race. He continues to give back to Hempstead High School students by returning to discuss Dartmouth and the college application process.
“While in college, it’s very important to focus on yourself and not where everyone else is at,” Correa said. “I know that’s a very difficult thing to do, but it is also important. The only person you should compare yourself to is your older self.”
Karen Lopez, the 2014 Valedictorian from Hempstead High School, is a senior at Columbia University, majoring in economics. She was born in El Salvador and came to the United States when she was eight years old. She is now happily living in the city. The transition from Salvador to the United States was difficult for her because English wasn’t her first language. As time passed, Lopez practiced English with the help of her third grade teacher. Fast forward to senior year, Lopez realized how challenging the college application was for her. She focused on Ivy League schools because of the need-based financial assistance. The competitiveness of applying to these schools drove her hunger to become intellectually challenged.
“Focusing on Ivy Leagues and coming from a school like Hempstead High School was hard in itself because I found people doubting me. I didn’t have too many people to look up to. I couldn’t speak to my parents about the stress of the process and I couldn’t look at anyone else in my family because I was the first one to consider going to college. This truly tested my perseverance as I questioned myself many times if I was good enough to go to a top college,” she said.
Lopez felt intimidated at first when she visited colleges and it was difficult for her to find her voice in a new environment. She saw that there weren’t many students with her racial background at the top Ivy League schools. This has driven her to work even harder in her school work to show that she can make it in life, regardless of where she comes from. Although it took her a year to embrace her culture at Columbia University, this was the time she needed. She decided to join Latinxs, a student organization on campus. This transformed her whole college experience.
“I realized that while I did like being exposed to different people, I also needed the space to spend time with people who looked like me and who were facing similar struggles. Through this organization, I met some of my closest friends and started to learn a lot from them about Latinidad and what it meant to be trailblazers in our communities,” she said.
Dondre Lemon, a junior journalism major at LIU Post who is black, was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts and moved to the Bronx when he was six months old. The transition from the city to Long Island was difficult for him when he arrived at Post.
“When I first arrived on campus, I did feel different from the other students because the majority of the students were from Long Island and I was a city kid that didn’t know certain topics students would talk about,” he said. Although this took a toll on him when he started at Post, his passion for unity of cultures drove him to become more interested in reporting and journalism. Lemon has demonstrated to professors and others that it depends on the individual, not the color of their skin. People would not have guessed that Lemon was a reporter in the Bronx while he was in high school. He demonstrated excellence by receiving an award for his reporting skills and by publishing two articles with the nor news. Lemon is a staff writer now for the LIU Post school newspaper and the creator of the new PTV- Pioneer news show. He is thankful for the support system that has helped him with his transition to the college environment.
“Almost every professor helped me in some way. A lot of them definitely made the transition easier for me and warmed me up to the campus. I definitely know my success coach helped a lot, making me feel comfortable, if I had any problems; I know I can go to her for anything. Having friends has also helped me, and what makes it better for me is that I am meeting new people of different cultures, which I feel everyone should have in their circle of friends,” he said.
Next year, Lemon will take an editorial position on the student newspaper. He continues to be an inspiration for students coming from low socio-economic backgrounds who may lack confidence in their abilities.
Lemon believes that the negative stereotyping and labeling needs to change. “The first thing I do is tell my friends of color not to classify any group. Don’t say all whites this, or Muslims that. Right now, we need to be together and be united, no matter the color of your skin,” he said.
As a reporter, Lemon wants to show others that they do not have to have a high socio-economic background or grow up in a wealthy community to make it in any career they desire. “If I can inspire one person that they can make it just the way they are, I will definitely feel like I have made a difference in the world,” he said.
Amoy Brown, 2016 graduate of Hempstead High School, is now a sophomore at the University of Albany, with
an English major and journalism minor. She was born in Jamaica and moved to America when she was five years old. Brown has also felt like an outcast in a college that’s predominately white. Growing up in Hempstead, people had expectations of how she is supposed to behave. However, she proves them wrong.
“My skin color is something that I have definitely became more conscious of,” she said. Also with the world today, it’s kind of hard to do anything without thinking about the barriers that race does cause.”
In Brown’s college environment, she has noticed instances in which she was the only black person in her class, but she didn’t let this hold her back. “Just because I’m more conscious of it now doesn’t mean it makes me any less confident in who I am or what I do,” she said
With this confidence, Brown has taken advantage of what the university offers. She noticed how UAlbany celebrates cultures. She found various organizations that help empower people of color like herself. She joined an organization called the Black Theater Production, which promotes the performing arts for people of color. In addition, Brown was awarded a journalism internship with the student affairs media team. She also joined an organization called “Her Campus,” an online magazine where she can express herself.
Tibian Ahmed, a senior at Stony Brook University, was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Ahmed, who is Muslim,
has encountered many instances when she has been racially profiled and has felt like an outcast, especially during her years of schooling.
“As early as elementary school all the way through my now final semester at college. It’s happened at work, my internships, even in personal settings meeting some of my non Muslim friends’ parents,” she said.
At times, in social settings at school, Ahmed has felt tested because of the comments made about her. She noticed how students would take pictures of her and make fun of her while she was sitting in the dining hall. People would also taunt with her hijab. Ahmed was the only girl who wore the hijab at her first school, SUNY Brockport. “People would purposely work in groups of three so that they wouldn’t work with me,” she said.
Ahmed has had uncomfortable situations with professors as well. During her freshman year at SUNY Brockport, students were assigned a 10 page research paper and the professor gave the topics to the students. The professors gave her, ‘Should the U.S Iraq war have started?” She was the only student assigned this topic. She had no choice but to comply with the professor’s request. In order to make this assignment unbiased, Ahmed made sure she asked other students if they thought the war should have started. Towards the end of her presentation, the professor stated her own biased opinion.
Ahmed has encountered other moments when professors would make thoughtless statements about Islamic terrorism or extremism and try to convince her that her hijab is an inconvenience. Also, professors at both colleges she attended have asked her how the process was for her family coming to the United States as refugees. Ahmed felt as if they were committed to setting a low standard for her by assuming she wasn’t American. Ahmed had to overcome these situations on her own because her parents didn’t have the same experiences. Because her siblings are significantly younger, they too didn’t understand what she has gone through. Ahmed also realized the significance of the date September 10, 2001, the day before 9/11. This was the day she placed her hijab on for the very first time, when she was six years old.
Although she has faced criticism, Ahmed used this to elevate herself in school instead. She began interning at CNN. She interned with white men who were middle aged and she noticed how they had a different tone with her as she stepped in to contribute.
“I get it, because they didn’t experience people like me. This is a pattern; this is how they have been taught to think, and it’s a bigger issue. It’s unfortunate, you are at a point where you can think for yourself but they chose not to, people chose not to challenge themselves because it’s more convenient for them,” she said.
Before transferring to Stony Brook, Ahmed became a speaker for the diversity conference at her first school, SUNY Brockport. She spoke out to faculty members and students about her life growing up post 9/11 and her experiences. Ahmed also founded the MSA (Muslim Student Association), which tries to bring a Muslim friendly environment to students, holding events about Islam awareness and reaching out to non-Muslim students on campus about their experiences growing up on post 9/11.
“It’s either I was going to do something to make myself feel like I belong there or just let it get to me,” Ahmed said.
At Stony Brook, Ahmed has become an executive producer for Newsbreak En Espanol and also an EOP success coach to mentor students on time management, critical thinking and writing skills.
“Don’t keep yourself in a bubble – what scares you the most is the most important thing to challenge yourself with,” she said. “You need to be respectful and make sure you are not a part of the problem.”
These students, like so many of their peers, have overcome prejudice and stereotyping by working hard and demonstrating excellence. The issue has not gone away and needs to be further addressed in our communities today.
Until then, let’s continue to work hard and demonstrate that we are all the same. It’s time to stand up and remember we are all dreamers. Let’s make the labeling stop and make America great again in this way.

Editor’s Note: In light of recent mass shootings in the U.S., the Pioneer is republishing the university’s guidelines and protocols issued in Feb. 2017 as a public service for the school community.
There have been 317 mass shootings in the United States, close to one every day, in 2017, according to the Gun Violence archive. The harsh reality of mass shootings is that they could occur at any place and anytime. Since 1999, there have been 31 mass school shootings in the United States, which have made worldwide headlines and devastated school communities. The massacres at Columbine High School, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and Virginia Tech University, among others, have led schools, including LIU Post, to strengthen their security protocols and strategize if it were to happen to them.
The LIU Post Department of Public Safety includes 22 full-time, New York State certified security officers. It is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors on LIU Post’s campus. The department works with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments, and the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management. The Public Safety Department created its own guidelines in early 2017, based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s “Active Shooter: How to Respond” booklet, which includes emergency phone numbers and tactics. The guidelines are on the university website at http://liu.edu/cwpost/Public-safety.
According to the university guidelines, “because active shooter situations are often over within ten-to- fteen minutes before law enforcement [or Public Safety] arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared both mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.” Within that time frame, the guidelines suggests to “take note of the two nearest exits,” “secure the door [in the room],” “if in a hallway, get into a room and secure the door,” and as a last resort, “attempt to take the shooter down.” If an active shooter is in your vicinity, the guidelines call to “escape if possible,” and “hideout where the shooter is less likely to find you while [remaining silent].” If you are the first person to call 911, the guidelines suggest to provide the phone operator with as many details possible, including location of the shooter, the number of shooters, if more than one, physical description of the shooter(s), number and type(s) of weapons, and number of potential victims at the location.
Michael Fevola, who became the Director of Public Safety in August 2017, said his team would rely on text messaging and emails during active shooter situations, although he has not experienced one on campus.
“In the event of an incident including an active shooter, Public Safety has protocols in place and the ability to immediately alert the entire campus community via a mass text/email blast with specific advisements and instructions,” Fevola said. “Those messages can also be used to continuously update the community, alert individuals what areas they should stay away from, and what to do, including the “Run/Hide/ Fight” protocols.” The Pioneer reported that the “Run/Hide/Fight” protocol was instituted in February 2017. “[It was] not in response to something happening, just to keep the campus safe,” Dr. John Lutz, English professor and chair of the faculty council, said in The Pioneer’s article, “Stop, Drop, Roll” published on Feb. 15, 2017. Lutz said, at the time, that faculty members had expressed an interest in learning more about campus procedures during an emergency, which led to a meeting for faculty on Feb. 1. At the meeting, Paul Rapess, the former director of Public Safety who retired last summer, discussed the new procedure, which implemented to keep up to date with happenings.
The Public Safety department routinely conducts joint training exercises with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments on campus. With this training in place, local police have a better feel for the campus during emergency situations.
According to LIU Post’s CampusFirearms & Weapons Policy, which is available on the LIU website under ‘University Policies,’ says “the possession of dangerous weapons, including any pistol, revolver, an incendiary bomb, switchblade, dagger or bludgeon, as well as harmless instruments designed to look like weapons are prohibited” on campus. “Other than police officers or military personnel on active duty, no person, including a licensee, may possess rearms anywhere on campus, whether in a building or on the grounds, without the prior written permission of the campus Provost and Director of Public Safety.” Violators of this policy will be subject to immediate disciplinary action and potential criminal prosecution. LIU Post strictly enforces its campus gun policy. As The Pioneer reported several years ago, on Nov. 17, 2011, a 72-year-old criminal justice adjunct professor accidentally shot himself in the groin and leg before his class. Although he was a retired Fire Marshall licensed to carry a weapon, the no weapons policy on campus was strictly enforced and he no longer teaches at LIU Post.
Katherine Hill-Miller, English professor and former dean of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences suggests every student and staff member should sign up for the Public Safety alerts, and said she would follow direction from Public Safety in an emergency.
“My first action would be to check for the text message and follow its directions,” Hill-Miller said. “If a message hadn’t come through, I’d assume that the incident hadn’t been reported, so I’d dial 911 first and then call campus security. Barring any information from anybody, I’d evaluate the situation—if the shooter was close, I’d gather students away from windows and doors in the classroom.”
Freshman education major Amanda Iovino agrees that the public safety alerts would come in handy in times of danger. “The texts are very useful in times of bad weather, and I think if [a school shooting] was to happen, the texts would be crucial.”
Fevola advises students and staff members to always be alert to their surroundings. While school shootings do not happen very often, he stressed that anything could happen, and one person reporting a suspicious person could potentially save lives.
“Stay vigilant and follow the old adage ‘see something, say something,’” Fevola said. “Any odd or unusual behavior should be reported to Public Safety, and we always protect [the] anonymity of the caller.”

In “Smite,” we are introduced to Ullr: The Glorious One. In the game, Ullr is designed in heavy robes and a hood, he also wears a bow and arrow and his twin axes. As a hunter god that lives in the frigid north, this design could not be more fitting.

There are many gods in Norse mythology, but few are as highly regarded as Ullr, “The Hunter God of Glory.” In both mythology and in “Smite,” Ullr doesn’t represent the boastfulness or shameful satisfaction one gets from seeing others fall. He is honorable and pays respect to true glory in all its forms.
For Ullr, glory is in the silence of snow fall, the perfect curve of a bow firing an arrow, the honorable victory earned in single combat and the moment of life’s rebirth. In Norse mythology, “The Hunter God of Glory” is an enigma ever keeping to himself. In “Smite,” Ullr is secretive and knows that true glory lies in remote hideaways, untouched by the hands of time, and it is in these very hideaways the shrines to Ullr can be found.
Ullr is highly respected even among the gods, for it his him and not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the all father is away. While other gods would abuse the power the throne brings, Ullr knows that his rule is an extension of Odin’s will.
The mythology states that Ullr is a skilled archer and an expert in close combat; this is no different in “Smite.” In the game, Ullr’s attacks and abilities revolve around his skills as a hunter. His passive ability is called weapons master; this allows Ullr to switch between fighting with his bow and his axes, and it is here that we see Ullr’s true skills. With his bow, Ullr’s abilities allow him to attack multiple
enemies at once while his axe-based abilities are for single combat.
Ullr’s second ability is called expose weakness. This allows Ullr to land critical hits easily. Just as his mythology counterpart finds glory in a bow firing an arrow true, Smite’s Ullr is able to find the perfect shot without hesitation.
Ullr’s ultimate is called Wield Axes; with this Ullr gains additional physical strength and lifesteal which allows him to deal more damage to a single enemy. This ties in to his mythology as it tells how Ullr finds honor in single combat and pays respect to his fallen foe.
While not much is known about Ullr, “Smite” does a good job of paying respect to his mythology and gives us a character that is both accurate and fun to play with.

Overlord” was released in theaters on Nov. 9. The movie is set hours before D-Day (June 6, 1944) and follows the actions of five survivors as they ambush Nazi-occupied France for a crucial mission. With the apocalypse stirring, the surviving paratroopers face some rather unusual enemies. Actor Wyatt Russell plays a key role in the film, and has appeared in several movies, including “22 Jump Street” and “This is 40.” Compared to these, “Overlord” has a darker, gorier theme.

Russell plays Corporal Ford, a “hard-headed individual whose team is caught in a tricky predicament.” He spoke about his character and the challenges he faced in his role. “It was physically demanding,” he said.
“Maintaining high energy was hard for three and a half months,” Russell said. Along with the physical exhaustion, the cast worked with dangerous equipment. “None of the gun fire was CGI (computer-generated imagery),” he said. “That’s what made the movie fun.”
Russell worked with producer J.J.Abrams who is known for producing films including “Star Trek” and “Mission Impossible: Fallout.” “It was great, knowing that as you’re acting you are being graced by the hand of J.J. is very confidence-boosting,” he said. Most of a producer’s work appears after the bulk of filming is completed. “It’s always good news when a producer doesn’t come to set [often],” Russell said.
When the film opened, Rotten Tomatoes gave it an 81 percent positive reaction. Anthony Uly, senior international business major, saw the movie on its opening date. “If you ever wished that ‘Saving Private Ryan’ was a B-movie (low-budget movie) splatterfest, it [Overlord] totally is. I really enjoyed it,” Uly said. “The cinematography was pretty good, overall storyline was unexpectedly great, and I liked the female lead; she gave me a little Wonder Woman tease.”
Russell described the movie as a “popcorn movie,” something that people go to see in the theater. “I want it to be a movie [for the audience] to go with their friends and see something that people put a lot of effort into,” he said.
Many World War, apocalyptic films have appeared over the years, but “Overlord” takes to the imagery of the apocalypse even further through the use of pyrotechnics and lack of green screens. “The best World War II movie has already been made— ‘Saving Private Ryan’— that changed the way a generation saw that war,” Russell said. “You’re not reinventing the wheel; just [looking at] a different take.”

The 2019-2020 women’s ice hockey team is the first in program history, and it is also the first Division I ice hockey program on Long Island. Head Coach Rob Morgan put together a team he believes will continue to make history. “I recruited every kid and everyone was recruited here for a reason, not just to fill a jersey, but to be a part of something special,” he said. 
The Sharks opened their season with an exhibition match against a professional women’s ice hockey team, the Metropolitan Riveters. The Sharks lost in a 10-3 battle, however they saw it as a great game to prepare them for the regular season. “Getting that first look at the kind of talent, speed, and strength we will be up against this season was an awesome learning experience,” junior captain Morgan Schauer said.
The Sharks officially kicked off regular season play with two games against University of Connecticut. While the Sharks lost in back-to-back days to the UCONN Huskies, the games showed the determination and potential they have in games to come.
In the first game against UCONN, freshman goalie Mia McLeod stood out, making 49 saves on 53 shots. A week later, McLeod made history as the first LIU ice hockey player to win conference recognition, as she was named “Rookie of the Week.” In the second game against UCONN, freshman forward, Carrigan Umpherville scored the first goal of the regular season for the Sharks. 
The early season schedule is made up of some extremely challenging games, including reigning NCAA Division I champions University of Wisconsin. The team played University of Wisconsin on Friday, Oct. 18 and Saturday, Oct. 19. Before the game, Coach Morgan said he expected a tough game, but that nothing is decided beforehand. “I know how good they are and our team knows how good they are. But the outcome is determined after 60 minutes. So, we are gonna go out there and play our hardest and give them a good game,” he said.
The Sharks fought hard but fell in both games with the scores of 2-10 and 0-12. However, the team is taking these games as learning experiences, according to freshman captain, Matilda af Bjur. “Playing against the best is an indescribable feeling. We have a way to go to get there, but it is a journey me and the team are ready to do,” she said.
Junior captain, Morgan Schauer, also had a positive outlook on the loses to the Wisconsin Badgers with the belief that these games are “going to make us stronger and help us to build up our program.”
In addition to play against high ranked teams, one of the biggest challenges the team has faced is the youth across the team. Twenty-one out of their 23 team members are freshmen. “It’s a pack of puppies running around,” Coach Morgan said. 
Without seniors on the team, Morgan said the team lacks the looming sense of a “last ride” among seniors. They don’t have the mindset that this is their last year to win. “Usually, it’s your seniors that will set the tone or raise the bar because it is their last year to try and win. But right now, they have four years to win,” Morgan said. 
Up next for the Sharks is two games against Coach Morgan’s former team, Yale University. The games are being played on Friday, Oct. 25 and Saturday, Oct. 26.

Women’s rugby’s sophomore forward, Sydney Long plays an important role as one of the team’s top players. The team won their last game of the fall season, over Molloy College with 27-12, and Long led the team in tackles and scored a try. Long also scored tries in three other games throughout the season.
The rugby team finished their fall season with an overall record of 2-6. Long says it was a “growing season” for the team as it was the first time in program history they were able to play 15 vs. 15 competitions. She also mentioned the younger members of the team, as there are only six upperclassmen out of 18 players. Long said it took some time for the team to work through different concepts and to come together. 
However, Long is very proud of how the team united towards the end of the fall season. “At the end, we finally pulled it together and we worked really hard and we did really well our last three competitions,” she said. 
The LIU rugby team is not a member of the NCAA, rather they are a part of the NIRA, the National Intercollegiate Rugby Association. Because of this, when the university announced the merger be-tween NCAA Division I and Division II, it did not directly affect the rugby team. However, Long says their team has felt positive impacts of the university’s move to Division I. “We get the prospects of the upgraded athletic training room, obviously the money for scholarships, and the money for new gear,” she said. “So that was a really big help this year.”
Long, a Tennessee native, came to Long Island to work towards pursuing a career in the FBI. “I want to be in the FBI, and I thought that the biggest police hub, in my mind, was in New York. So, I knew I wanted to come up north and be as close to a big hub as possible,” she said. Long said that rugby brought her to LIU, but the FBI was the long-term goal she had in mind. 
Long started playing rugby late in life. Having played her first year of rugby as a junior in high school, she said it wasn’t until October of her senior year that she actually began to think about pursuing a collegiate rugby career. However, even with coming in very late in the recruiting process, Long said she “made it work.” 
Looking towards the spring rugby season, the game format will switch to 7 vs. 7, leaving eight of the fall’s previous starters on the bench. “Not everyone’s gonna get to start now. So, I think a big thing for us is just continuing being a family and not let that divide come between us,” Long said. 
Academically, Long is currently undergoing the process of obtaining a summer internship with the FBI at either a location close to her home in Tennessee or at their home base in Quantico, V.A.
Looking toward the future, Sydney Long has big goals. In the short-term future, those goals include a successful spring season with the rugby team and a call back from the FBI.

The coronavirus pandemic has changed what the world once knew as normal. In-person activities, such as going to school and work, have taken on a new version of normality via virtual experiences. With many classes being moved online, hands-on professions like nursing have declined educationally because of the quality universities are able to teach these fields online.
When the coronavirus began spreading to college communities back in March 2020, universities sent students home, regardless of their major or area they were studying. Nursing students began taking classes online. For many, senior clinicals were cancelled for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester. 
Senior clinicals are an important time and experience for those about to graduate and enter the nursing field because they are a chance for students to work one-on-one with a nurse in a specific field of nursing, get real on-the-job experiences, and work in a hospital.
First-year registered nurse Jenna Doherty’s clinicals were canceled and she is now unsure about starting her first job at Stony Brook University Hospital. “I believe I missed out on a huge opportunity to learn on the job experience when my senior clinical was canceled,” Doherty said. “Now that I am beginning my first job I am a little nervous that I have not been in a hospital or practicing nursing since March and that my nursing skills are going to be rusty.”
Doherty is not alone in this. Many universities across the nation cancelled their clinical programs for the spring semester, meaning Doherty is just one among many who lost this experience and are now applying for jobs as registered nurses. 
Currently, only a few universities have resumed their senior clinicals. Long Island University Post campus is one of these schools. However, even the in-person clinicals are very different from how they were pre-COVID. 
“Clinicals are still very educational, however not as educational as they would usually be,” senior nursing student Amanda Masullo said. “We aren’t allowed to do certain things. For example, inserting an NG tube or basically anything that has to do with the patient’s mouth, nose, bodily fluids, etc. It’s a shame because these are the times when you’re supposed to do things hands on and learn and we’re kind of deprived of that.”
Across the nation,  nursing majors have had to be flexible and work within the different universities regulations. For example, universities are encouraging online courses, lectures, and labs. Nursing classes or simulations that were always taught in the classroom before the pandemic are now primarily online. 
Doherty, a recent graduate from Post whose senior spring semester of nursing school was moved online, said that she was very lucky to have professors who were dedicated to helping the students learn. However, in her opinion, taking the more information-heavy classes required for sophomores and juniors would have been much more difficult to take online. 
Another big change to the nursing major is how the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) examination is now taken and passed. The NCLEX examination is a nationwide test used to administer the licensing of nurses in the United States, Canada, and Australia. The test is set up to have students apply and analyze questions and scenarios that should have been taught and understood while in nursing school. After graduating, nursing students must pass this exam before they are deemed a qualified registered nurse.
Many changes have been made to this exam due to the coronavirus pandemic. The exam time has been shortened from six hours to four hours and they have decreased the amount of correct questions from 75 to 60 in order to pass the test. The maximum amount of questions has also been decreased from 265 questions to 130 questions. They have also removed pre-test questions and research section questions. 
The coronavirus pandemic is not only affecting those who are currently in nursing school, but is also heavily affecting those who recently finished school and are looking for jobs in the nursing field. 
Healthcare companies have also implemented a hiring freeze in many hospitals due to the coronavirus and this is making it difficult for those who have recently graduated to find jobs. Once recent graduates can find jobs, they are being required to do more online learning and simulations as a form of orientation. 
Doherty was just recently hired by Stony Brook University Hospital as a Neurology ICU nurse. Instead of in-person training and orientation, she is being required to take an online two-week orientation course. After finishing nursing school online and then having to continue training online, this orientation makes Doherty concerned and uneasy. “Usually during orientation, you get to learn the ropes of the hospital and where everything is,” she said. “Also during orientation, they bring you to a sim lab to go over a crash course of nursing fundamentals which will now all be online as a simulation.”
The integration of online learning for nursing school and job orientation is an impacting factor that is creating uneasiness and worry through the nation’s young and learning nurses. These impacts of the coronavirus in the medical field will have a lasting effect within healthcare.

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic illness that affects millions of families each year. According to the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, PD is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. Modern medicine and neurologists have been developing stronger and more effective treatments for this disease every year. 
Dr. Gemma Moya-Galé is a professor at LIU Brooklyn  and speech-language pathologist who researches PD. Her expertise can be most notably witnessed in her recently published article “The effects of intensive speech treatment on intelligibility in Parkinson’s disease: A randomised controlled trial”, where she discusses the newfound breakthroughs in the use of intensive speech treatment to improve speech intelligibility for those with PD.
“Our study was the first one to examine conversational intelligibility gains in a randomized controlled trial for PD and we were able to provide evidence of treatment benefits to improve that aspect of their lives. The clinical implications for this are, therefore, huge,” Moya-Galé said. 
Moya-Galé’s goal is to improve the quality of life in her and her colleagues’ patients. Her study that was published by the Lancet took six years to complete, and contained documented and verified research supporting both Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD) effectiveness, as well the importance of physical activity. 
“Close to 90% of people with PD develop voice problems over the course of the disease. One of the most devastating consequences patients face in their quality of life is social isolation and withdrawal, given that they lose the ability to be understood, particularly in noisy environments. Once voice problems have appeared and worsened, many patients may decide not to partake in conversations anymore, out of frustration, for example.” 
In order to get a better understanding of the disease itself, Moya Galé elaborated on what exactly the nature of the disease entails.
 “The disease is progressive and it may start long before a diagnosis is made, loss of smell could actually be one of the first signs. Getting the right treatment is crucial, as many times modifications to medication have to be made based on patients’ reactions to it.” 
LSVT LOUD treatment, is the most well researched and understood kind of treatment used to treat individuals. The LOUD part of the treatment, refers to patients using their loud voice, and emphasizes use of sounds like “AH” at various pitch tones, in order to rehabilitate their speech. 
“[LSVT LOUD] is currently the gold standard in the treatment of hypophonia in PD. It also has decades of research behind it that show its benefits in improving not only voice, but also facial expressions, or even swallowing,” she said. 
Moya-Galé said that LSVT LOUD has significantly improved intelligibility and patients with PD’s ability to be understood. This is important because there is a gap between the communication levels of the patient with PD and their caregivers. Improving the communication between the patient and the caregivers will improve the overall mental well being and stability of those with PD because they will know that they can still speak clearly enough to be understood. 
Moya-Galé believes that exercise is also essential to improving the neuroplasticity in patients with PD. Neuroplasticity is the concept that the brain can still learn, improve and remain malleable even within the patient’s final years being alive.
 “Physical activity not only improves aspects like balance and walking, remember that people with PD are at a greater risk of falls, so addressing these problems is very important for overall safety, but it can also increase quality of life, for example, by fostering and prolonging the individual’s independence,” she said.
Moya-Galé urges those with PD to begin rehabilitation as soon as possible.
“Rehabilitation is key in PD, and the earlier someone starts receiving those services (including physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and such) the better. Rehabilitation services undoubtedly improve quality of life and we, as therapists, advocate for their early implementation,” said Moya-Galé. 
While she does hope there will be a cure in the traditional sense, she still noted that there are factors within our control that can prevent the disease interfering drastically with the patients lives. 
“As for habits or factors that could have a protective role; exercise is key. Physical activity has tremendous benefits …  not just for maintaining good physical function but also cognitive function.” 
Moya-Galé continues to study PD and work as a speech pathologist in order to foster independence in patients so that they can keep their voice for as long as possible.
Her work not only continues to impact the lives of not just her patients, and their families, but the scientific community, who research PD and attempt to learn how to effectively treat those who develop PD, at any stage of their life.
For more information about speech therapy treatments for PD, refer to Moya-Galé’s research on “The Lancet”.

All classes at Post were moved to remote instruction for a period of two weeks as of Oct. 15. University President Kimberly Cline sent out a mass email to the Post community stating that “Last weekend, a small number of positive cases were reported as a result of off-campus social gatherings that violated LIU’s Code of Conduct. Additional cases were reported over the past few days by students who were in contact with students at the gatherings. Most of these cases were contact traced back to these isolated events. Some students, who have not tested positive, have been asked to quarantine.”
    There were a number of students who were required to quarantine because they had been in contact with a student who had coronavirus or tested positive themselves. These students were notified about the matter and moved into Suffolk hall to carry out their isolation. 
“I didn’t prepare for quarantine,” senior psychology major Tiana Ono said. “We got the news last minute that we needed to get tested. One of our friends is an RA and she’s the one who told us that we were being put in quarantine that night so to start packing. I didn’t get a call until around 8 to 9 p.m. from someone at the school telling me to get out of the dorms. So I had a few hours to pack and grab food and stuff, everything moved very fast.” 
Similar sentiments were shared by senior sports management major Emily Poole. “We did not get much time to prepare. We were told pretty late about the quarantine in a different building so we just packed essentials quickly and moved in,” Poole said.
    Food is delivered to our door by resident assistants and Promise employees.
“The food is pretty basic but as an athlete it’s hard not being able to control what foods we eat,” Poole said. “We get plenty of food and snacks but the quality and healthiness is not the best but we don’t go without so that’s good.” 
    Both students shared that the quarantine has had a slightly positive effect on their studies. With plenty of free time and no distractions from peers or activities, they have had more time to study and do their school work. Ono has found solace in the contact and regularity that her classes offer. “Class throughout the week has been helpful since it gives me something to do,” she said. “Weekends feel very long. It also sucks that we can’t even go outside for a walk or something.”
Poole had a similar opinion of her time in quarantine. “One good thing about this quarantine is that it has been around midterms so plenty of time to study,” she said.
    Poole expressed the difficulty being in isolation. 
“Quarantine is a pretty big mood killer. As an international student this is not my first time doing this but it is so mentally and physically challenging,” she said. “Not having the comforts of your own room, the heat and wifi have not been working great, the air in the room gets stuffy and not getting any fresh air, a walk or exercise is so tough. My fellow quarentiners and I joke that the first few days go by slowly, a week goes by and you think ok that wasn’t too bad but by day 10 you are climbing the walls.”
Ono agreed that being alone all of the time is difficult. “My mood comes and goes. Sometimes I’m happy, sometimes I’m angry, and sometimes I want to jump out of my window. I also wish that they would let us go outside for an hour or something. It really sucks being locked up in a room for a long time.”  
Ono and Poole both tested negative for coronavirus, but were required to quarantine due to being in close contact with individuals who tested positive.

Over the past several months, life and everything it entails has abruptly forced us to evolve due to the coronavirus. Athletes at Long Island University have had to make significant seasonal lifestyle changes to safely progress during this ongoing pandemic.
Jamie Alvino, a senior on the women’s’ lacrosse team studying health sciences and nutrition/diabetics, claimed when everything was shut down, athletics had protocols to keep athletes in shape.“When COVID started, my teammates and I were emailed by our strength and conditioning coach specific workout plans. They were not mandatory to do but highly recommended. The workouts were emailed around the first week in April,” Alvino said.
The four-year member of the LIU Sharks women’s lacrosse team continued to keep up with the athletics staff’s measures. “Since then, and until the 2020 school year started, I have been following our team’s workout plan. It was mixed with cardio, HIIT, and strength training (bodyweight). When the LIU Post campus closed for two weeks in mid-October, we were emailed again with home workouts that I followed as well.”
Camden Orth, a sophomore broadcasting major and starting quarterback for the football team, shared that he has been making the most of the whole situation. “I’ve spent a majority of the semester at home working out and attending classes through zoom. I have a weight room set up in my garage,” he said. “I work out five days a week and do mobility work seven days a week.”
Since the start of the 2020 school year, teams have granted some allowances for their usual schedules. Although athletes are grateful for this opportunity, many would agree that the circumstances given are not the traditional wholehearted team vibes from the past. Athletes and coaches will attest that isolated and socially distanced practices and workout sessions have directly impacted their teams.
Alvino shared, “I’ve definitely noticed a direct impact on our team’s bond due to COVID safety protocols. Since we have to remain socially distancing when playing on the field, it was a difficult start,” she said. “We started in groups/pods of 5, so it was definitely hard to connect with people outside of our group. But as time went on, we were able to branch out of our groups/pods and play with different groups. My teammates and I are just doing everything we can to stay safe, have fun and focus on the sport we all love to hopefully be able to complete in the 2021 spring season.”
Jilian Hugh, a sophomore criminal justice major on the cheerleading team, claimed the athletic staff taught the team knew workouts to stay in shape throughout the pandemic. “Starting off the fall 2020 season, the coaches provided our program with an hour of assistance each week from LIU’s athletic trainer. We were taught many different exercises along with how to use the various types of weight-room equipment properly and efficiently. The workouts are intended to work every part of our bodies. Our routine begins with basic cardio, warm-ups, and stretching. After that, we begin the more intense, fast pace workouts that may include things like dumbbells, medicine balls, and cardio machines.”
In efforts to keep the entire LIU community safe during these worrisome times, the student-athletes have been extremely optimistic and understanding, given their current circumstances. Teams have even begun alternative ways to bond and stay in shape together.
Emma Cantwell, a junior early childhood education major on the women’s lacrosse team, shared that leadership has been vital in getting the team through these rough times.“Although COVID has impacted our fall season dramatically, our Coach has done an amazing job in finding new and innovative ways to keep us connected. As a result, we have experienced a great deal of events on zoom, such as team yoga.”
Alyssa Boll, a senior education major on the women’s lacrosse team, believes the team has become stronger together.
“This whole situation definitely made us closer as a team because we had to figure out how to have team chemistry while being socially distant. We all worked together to keep each other safe and healthy, so we’re able to compete together as a family.”
Jillian Hugh added that safety is of utmost priority. “While navigating through these new COVID regulations, we mainly all want to make sure we are comfortable, staying safe, and mainly healthy. Our new normals are focused around making sure that our health comes first, and we do our best to prevent the spread.”

From Friday, Sept. 30, to Sunday, Oct. 2, the Sharks women’s golf team competed among 16 universities in their third competition of the season at the Navy Fall Invitational. 
The Sharks finished fifth as a team. However, out of 88 total competitors, it was Sharks’ senior Emily Byrne who came out on top. Her 2-over-par score of 146 was three strokes ahead of the second-place finisher, Anna Ferreyra-Heit from Delaware State. 
This is Byrne’s first season at LIU after playing three years at Limestone University in South Carolina. 
Byrne was also the Sharks’ top performer over the first two events of the season. At the Delaware State Fall invitational on September 19-20, Byrne finished fifth individually, only one stroke away from tying for first with the other top four golfers. 
In the week leading up to the Navy Fall Invitational, Byrne finished first for the Sharks at the Boston College Intercollegiate. 
Byrne is from Liverpool, England, but knew for many years she had a goal of playing golf in the NCAA. 
“I’ve been playing golf for about 10 years now, and ever since I was about 14 or 15, I had friends who were coming over here and started playing college golf,” she said. “Then, when I got to about 15 and 16, I set my heart on playing golf and then getting to the collegiate level.”
With a combination of her athletic and academic plans in mind, Byrne had her heart set on coming to the Big Apple to finish her collegiate career. 
“I was down in South Carolina, and I decided I wanted to change and started looking in terms of location to be a business major,” she said. “I wanted to head up to New York, and then I started looking around this area and found LIU. I looked at the team, then started communicating with the coach and decided it was definitely the school for me.”
Bryne knew it was going to be important to make an impact early on in her playing time here at LIU, and she could not have wished for a better outcome. 
“It’s amazing, I’m just on cloud nine right now. Coming over here, I didn’t know where my golf was going to be. I had quite a big injury over the summer, and I was not sure if I was going to be able to play at the level I knew I could,” she said. “After I got here and had all the encouragement from the team and all the support I needed, to come and play really well is big for me.”
Despite the conditions of the long weekend, Byrne credits her performance, along with that of the team, to the perseverance they have shown so far this season.
“We had very bad weather the whole time. We had the back end of the hurricane, so we just wanted to get through and stay as dry as we could,” she said. “Just knowing I had to get through it and stay strong mentally helped it.”
Byrne was named a Northeast Conference (NEC) Prime Performer for the month of September. She could not have been more thrilled for the honor.
“I was really shocked and just couldn’t have expected this first month to go any better, so I’m excited to see the rest of the season and see how I do,” Bryne said.
Bryne looks to capitalize on her success early on at LIU and collectively carry it throughout the rest of the season.
“The goal is definitely to win the conference with the team we have and a great set of girls who have the ability to do it,” she said. “Personally, I just want to enjoy the last two years that I have of college golf with a great team.”

By Giancarlo Salazar, Staff Writer
On the first day of classes, your professor will often hand out a packet either physically or digitally titled “Syllabus.” The syllabus is a contract between the professor and the student outlining the student’s responsibilities, and what rights they have access to. Many students will often take a glance, review it with their professor during class, and shove it into their backpack for it to never be seen again. The other portion of students may read through it to better prepare for their class. 
Students can expect to find important information such as resources, deadlines, classroom policies, and contact information for office hours. In some instances, a student might find money. 
In an entrepreneurship course, one professor hid a message within two of his class’ syllabi. The text read, “There is one envelope in Dean Fusaro’s office with $40 in it. Just ask her and it’s yours. The first student from the class that finds it gets it.” 
Entrepreneurship professor and CEO of Sage Marketing, Daniel Klein, explained why it’s important for students to read the syllabus.
“I think it’s very important because it tells them how to do well in the class, so to me the syllabus is the instructions for how to do well,” Klein said. “I would hope that students would at least glance at it or look it over. Mine are very specific, I’ll give them all the rubrics for any midterm, any finals. I’ll tell them exactly what they need to do to pass the class — I want the students to do well, I’m going to show them how to do well, and all they have to do is read it.”
Out of everyone in Klein’s classes, only one student came forward to claim the prize. Freshman business administration major Talia Romito was the first— and only— student to secure the forty dollars hidden within the syllabus. 
“I definitely think you should read your syllabus. It helps me personally a lot just to get an idea of the classes you’re going into and just prepares you for your year to come,” Romito said. “I’ve always read my syllabus since high school and I plan to continue doing so throughout my four years here.”
Even after professors emphasize the importance of their syllabus, students still tend to ignore it or not look through it carefully. 
“I think students skip reading the syllabus because it can be long and overwhelming,” Klein said. “You need to know where to look. If I were a student I would definitely look at the rubrics if there are any in there. It’s a bit overwhelming because a typical syllabus is twelve or fourteen pages long.”
Reading the syllabus is often looked at as being responsible for knowing what’s going on in the class. 
“I feel like I went in [to class] like I could answer some questions based on the syllabus,” Romito said. “I kind of knew what my professor was talking about. — gives you an advantage going into the class, you’re not going in blind.”
Hiding money within the syllabus is not something professors typically do, but Klein found it to be an interesting way to see if his students were reading the material.
“I saw that a professor at another college did something like this and I just thought it would be fun to test out to see if anyone would find the money,” Klein said. 
“My initial reaction was confusion… Why did it say to pick up forty dollars in the dean’s office?” Romito said. “At first I thought it was a joke, I actually didn’t pick it up until four or five days after, because I thought it was just a joke and didn’t want to go and embarrass myself. So one day, I asked Professor Klein after the end of class, and he said no it’s not a joke and no one has picked it up so go pick it up you deserve it. Then, I realized it was real and it was pretty cool, I felt proud.” 
In the eyes of an entrepreneur, a couple of lessons can be learned from this experiment. 
“My classes teach entrepreneurship, one of the keys of entrepreneurship is knowing when to look out for opportunities that other people don’t see. So as an entrepreneur, if you find out or figure out an idea before other people, that can be your whole business. I want to teach them through experiential learning that there are opportunities everywhere, where you least expect it. That’s why I hid it inside the syllabus,” Klein said.
“I think that if you’re given the opportunity, take it,” Romito said. “I had the opportunity to win forty dollars and I was hesitant at first, if I didn’t go and see if it was real, I would have never won the money. So I say go with your gut and take the opportunities presented to you.” 
Seeing how this lesson was mostly entrepreneurial, how could a professor in another field of study take this type of experiment and apply it to their course?
“I would suggest that they could put something like this in some of their content where students would have to find the certain information and then the professor would know that they are not just reading information and taking a test, but they’re really understanding the content that they are doing,” Klein said.
In the future, Klein’s students may be more inclined to read their syllabi.

The 2022 Major League Baseball season has concluded. This immediately leads into the MLB offseason, which brings about all the free agent signings, trades and any other roster moves made by every major league club. 
The Yankees and Mets have both been at the forefront of much of the coverage surrounding offseason news. After breaking the American League home run record and being named AL MVP, Yankees superstar Aaron Judge became a free agent following his first six seasons in pinstripes. 
On Wednesday, Dec. 7, it was announced the Yankees and Aaron Judge agreed to a 9-year deal worth $360 million. 
This is the third largest contract in baseball history, only trailing extensions given to Mike Trout and Mookie Betts. It is also the largest deal ever for a free agent. 
Just one night prior, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Aaron Judge was headed to the San Francisco Giants, but immediately corrected himself after jumping the alert. 
After the announcement of Judge returning to the Bronx, it was confirmed Aaron Judge turned down a 10-year deal from the San Diego Padres worth $400 million. The Average annual value (AAV) from the two offers is the same at $40 million. However, Judge would have received an extra year had he accepted the Padres’ offer. 
Senior digital art & design major Anthony Hines confirms resigning Aaron Judge was the Yankees’ top need this off-season. 
“One of the Yankees’ top priorities, much like how it was of the utmost importance, was to re-sign Judge,” he said. “The face of your franchise and the AL MVP had to be back in the Bronx, especially after he hit 62 home runs and broke the American League home run record.”
Hines believes Judge should be named captain to secure his legacy as a career Yankee.
“I would expect the Yanks to give Judge the captaincy. They made the commitment, he’s a Yankee for life, now let’s give him that honor,” he said.
Hines is happy with the acquisitions the Yankees have made so far but would love a couple more pieces to be brought in. 
Besides Tommy Kahnle, the Yankees have brought back Anthony Rizzo and Judge. I wouldn’t be surprised if we land Carlos Rodon to pair him well with Gerrit Cole in our rotation,” he said. “I wanna say we’ll make a sneaky run at Dansby Swanson. I just have that feeling.”
On the other side of the Whitestone Bridge, the Mets have been making many acquisitions as the third offseason of Steve Cohen’s ownership continues to bring high hopes to fans. 
Despite two-time CY Award Winner Jacob Degrom leaving in free agency, signing a 5-year, $185 million contract with the Texas Rangers, the Mets quickly looked for other pitching options. 
The Mets locked up 17-year veteran and reigning AL CY Young Award winner Justin Verlander to a 2-year deal worth $86,666,666, with a vesting option worth $35 million in 2025, pending Verlander pitches 140 innings in 2024. 
This is similar to the 3-year, $130 million deal the Mets agreed to with Max Scherzer last offseason. Currently, the Mets have both Scherzer and Verlander for the next two years, each making $43,333,333. With Scherzer now 38 years old, and Verlander heading into his age 40 season, it is clear the Mets will try and get the final productive years out of the veteran starters. 
The Mets also signed Japanese phenom Kodai Senga to a 5-year, $75 million deal following his 11-year career in the Nippon Professional Baseball League. 
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell had high expectations for the Mets’ off-season. 
“My top priorities were retaining our guys, especially Edwin Diaz, Brandon Nimmo and DeGrom, while also looking for hitters and bullpen help,” he said. 
Following his incredible 2022 campaign, which featured 32 saves and a 1.31 ERA, the Mets brought back their closer Diaz to a 5-year, $102 million deal with a 6th-year club option. 
Campbell believes it was crucial for the Mets to make the signings to keep their pitching at a top-tier level. 
“It was huge to get Verlander and Senga. After DeGrom and Walker left, I wasn’t sure where we would pivot to, but Steve Cohen and Billy Eppler were able to go all out to win over some of the best pitchers on the market,” he said. “Verlander may be older, but he is still one of the premier pitchers in the game, and Senga has superstar potential. Those two moves were very important after losing DeGrom and Walker.”
The Mets also re-signed outfielder Brandon Nimmo to an 8-year, $162 million deal following his seven seasons in a Mets uniform. Campbell believes bringing back a home-grown talent was a great move. 
“Nimmo has always been an important player on this team. He may not be a superstar, but the type of way he plays is very unique. He is a very consistent and disciplined hitter, and he is always reliable in the outfield,” he said. “He’s always the hardest worker, and you can see how much he loves being a Met. He is a fan favorite, and I think he can play a crucial role in this team’s pursuit of a championship.”
Campbell has high hopes for the Mets’ future following their moves so far. 
“I am very happy with what has been done thus far. I still think they need another big bat or two and a few more bullpen arms, but overall I am pleased and very excited for the 2023 season and beyond,” he said.

This fall season the Student Health and Counseling Center is offering flu shots for all C.W. Post students 18 and over. The vaccinations have been available since October 1st and will continue for as long as supplies last. Students must fill out a release and proof of age to receive the 12 dollar shot.
“We’re charging what we pay. We don’t make any money,” explained Bill Milford, the Director of Student Health and Counseling. “Our objective is to make sure the students who want it can get it.”
The true flu season spans from November to February, but the Health Center is getting a jump on the illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people with health risks get the flu vaccine in October. All healthy citizens are urged to get it in November.
The Health Center will conduct a traveling flu shot clinic in early November. The clinic will visit the Winnick Student Center and Hillwood Commons during Common Hour to give the injections.
Students who are squeamish around needles are in luck. There is a variation of the syringe that pushes the vaccination through the skin using carbon dioxide. “It’s not like a booster shot where it hurts afterwards” said Nurse Sylvia Barton. She went on to add, “You’re going to feel something or there’s something wrong with your neurological system.” According to the waiver, the side effects to the flu shot are “tenderness at the site of injection, fever, chills, headaches or muscular aches.”
The Center will begin Flu Prevention week on October 25th. Later this month, the Center will have a depression screening on October 7th, Alcohol Awareness Day on the 12th and Domestic Violence Prevention Day on the 19th.
Along with the flu shot, the Health Center provides the C.W. Post community with primary medical care, a gynecologist, free counseling sessions, nutritional guidance and much more. Also offered is blood testing for all sexually transmitted diseases. “If you’re sexually active, you should know where you stand,” Barton said.
The Student Health and Counseling Center is located in room 154 of the Life Science Building and is open from 8am to 8pm during the semester.

Letter to the readers,
Not only is the season changing, there ís a new air on campus.  It’s not that fresh cool breeze that slips through your window screens at night either.  Students are a little rambunctious and more energetic than usual this week.  You might have even seen some familiar faces- former students or faculty (cough, cough alumni.)  The athletic teams, especially the football team, have more adrenaline pumping through their veins because this is just any weekend for Post.  It’s Homecoming weekend!!
This is the one weekend that current and past Postonians take the most pride in. Essentially it’s the one time of the year when the entire school really comes together.  Students gather at the pep rally on Friday night.  The residence halls compete for the best and most creative skit, athletic teams are introduced for the seasons, a DJ provides the music and suddenly you are caught up with the crowd that’s singing some song you don’t even know.  But you sure as hell are having a fun time!  Then Saturday comes and everyone watches the football game on Hickox field.  There’s tailgating in the Pratt parking lot, families of students come from all over the states, alumni return to play in athletic games or just to come and enjoy the day with their alma mater!
If you’re a freshmen, than you have to experience this for yourself.  Trust us, this is not an event to miss at Post.  But before we get too carried away, lets introduce the sixth edition of our student newspaper.  Many interesting articles this week; one focuses on the increase of tuition, while one of our editors discusses the two primary candidates for New York governor.  In sports, both the boys and girls cross-country teams traveled to sunny Florida and came back with a few record-breaking times.
As for our arts and entertainment section of Loomings, we are still looking for anyone interested in writing book, movie or game reviews.  Please email us at  HYPERLINK “mailto:cwpstpnr@gmail.com” cwpstpnr@gmail.comÖdonít forget, we are still looking for that 50th email to give away that $500 prize!
From your staff of the Pioneer, Happy Homecoming and good luck Pioneers!

1. It would be cool if you guys can take pictures ofr random students around campus. I know  I would feel good seeing myself in the paperhave a good feeling to see myself in a paper. It creates some sort of a celeb/student status – . kinda like  make an on campus gossip section. I don’t know, it’s just an idea. The 1st edition was great, like all the rest and near future printed papers. Real professional!
Peace

2. Hi Pioneer staff,
If I could change things I’d have articles based more on world news, not just issues that effect the average frat boy. Many students aren’t aware of activities on campus, so doing articles on those clubs might be a good idea at the beginning of the year. However, more detailed articles on our government and current events would be great. Also, while I feel like it’s important that the arts section be expanded and worked upon, the combination of Loomings and the paper is a poor choice. The magazine was beautiful and the picture quality suffers when artwork is printed on newsprint. There is also even less attention on the arts on campus now that there is no publication. It’s too bad that Loomings is understaffed.
Thanks.
Sincerely,
E. Amaral
3. Hello,
I would like to see recaps of professional sports teams in the newspaper. Something about the Jets, Giants, N baseball teams, basketball teams, etc. I think it would be a nice touch to the paper and would grab a bigger audience.
Ps: Tthis is Ppaul from broadcast 25 and I told you I would e-mail you!

5. To “The Pioneer”,
Hello. Recently I read the first the first issue of The Pioneer and saw the ad in the back about “what you’d like to see”; so here I go! I am a currently enrolled Art student at the C.W. Post campus. I would love to do a comic strip per issue of the newspaper on campus life, commuter life and general college life. I think readers would really enjoy “seeing” this in their campus paper. I plan on making it some-what humorous and personal to the school. Please let me know if this is a possibility and I will send some comic strip ideas. Also, if there is ever any need for illustrations or photographs I would love to get involved with that too. 
Thank you for your time!
P. Stewart
6. Im just worried that maybe im so late to send this email 😀
I like the Pioneer a lot. It gives me a lot of opportunities.
To be honest, I know the Pioneer recently because I am an international students and also I did not pay attention to what is going on to the school hahahaha
however, i had a change to be interviewed during the chuseok story.
It was the first time to be in an article and i was so happy with my friends hahaha and we all laughed at my picture.
As an international student, it is easier to read the Pioneer because it is easy to relate to in comparison to the new york times.
In addition, if the Pioneer will add articles about the International students, a lot of them will pay attention! at least I hope so!

Coming off a tough overtime loss to first place St. Thomas Aquinas College by a score of 2-1, the Pioneers came out focused and determined for their next games at Molloy College (3-11) and Mercy College (6-6-2).
C.W. Post won in a 4-1 rout against the last-place Molloy Lions. Later on in the week, the Pioneers faced off against Mercy College (6-6-2), but lost in an exciting double overtime match-up.
“We played well both games,” said forward Rumen Kerekov. “We scored five goals in total in those games and we created many chances. Against Molloy we won convincingly, but we lost in a very unfortunate way to Mercy.”
Right from the start of the game against Molloy, the Pioneers came out energized and ready to play. The Pioneers scored two goals in the first half; one scored by freshman back Joakim Ohlson, and the other by junior midfielder David Carlsson. After these quick two goals, neither team would put up a point on the scoreboard until Molloy’s Dan Brown beat C.W. Post goalie Marco Jorgensen to make the score 2-1 in favor of Post.
Just five minutes after Molloy finally found their offense and came within one goal of tying the game, Carlsson scored his second goal of the game, and his fourth goal of the season. Post continued to pour it on when senior forward Emanuel Messina found the back of the net off a pass from Carlsson to put the game out of reach at a score of 4-1.
On Saturday, the Pioneers traveled to face Mercy College in an East Coast Conference showdown. Post took the early lead on a goal from sophomore forward Betim Bajrami, with the assist coming from Carlsson. Midway through the second half, Mercy would even up the score off a goal from Alex Cruz.
Both teams could not end the game in regulation, so overtime was needed. Neither team could find a way to win at the conclusion of the first overtime, so yet another extra period was needed. In the 104th minute, Cruz managed to give Mercy the lead on his second goal of the game, as this proved to be the final score of a thrilling battle with the Pioneers on the losing end.
“It was a tough loss, but we can still qualify for the playoffs if we beat Queens next Saturday,’ said Kerekov. “So we will definitely be pumped up for that game.”
The Pioneers next game will be at home against Nyack College (5-5) on Thursday at 2 p.m. Saturday, will be their last regular season game, which will be at home against Queens College at 2:30 p.m.

The C.W. Post Pioneers will not extend their season past this weekend. Post will not be involved in a PSAC Championship game. There will be no playoffs. And while the Pioneers outscored the Cheyney Wolves last week, the team may have proven why it won’t be in the postseason.
Cheyney is one of the worst teams in Division II. The team hasn’t had a winning season since 1979. Going back to 1995, the Wolves have a cumulative record of 8-161-1. Out of 151 Division II teams, the Wolves have the 134th offense. Any team should be able to stop their offense.
Go back to last week’s game. The Pioneers defeat the Wolves 63-28. Sure nine touchdowns on offense is a great stat but the defense gave up four. One of the problems with the Pioneers this year is the players’ demeanor on defense. There is no consistency from game to game. One week, the defense is all-world. The next, the squad surrenders points and puts the burden on the offense’s shoulders.
So many times this year, the Pioneers have given up easy yards. For the most part, they have been unable to stop their opponent’s rushing attack. This past week against one of the worst offenses in the nation, the Pioneers watched Cheyney run for 314 yards. Through 10 games, the Pioneers have given up 174 rushing yards per game.
Clearly that type of defense is not conducive of a playoff team. There have been so many instances this season where the defense should have or needed to come up big but fell short. As Coach Bryan Collins always points out to me, football has three phases. And while the offense has done well fighting through injuries, the special teams working through its own issues, the defense has not.
Regardless, there is room to grow for C.W. Post. The defense is full of young players. Donovan Edwards has started at cornerback as a true freshman. Sean Smith was having an excellent year before his knee injury and the vast majority of the starting defense will return next year.
But with one more game left against a solid slippery rock team, the Pioneers have an opportunity to reach seven wins and improve their record from last season. They’ll be in line to win as long as they can play a shutdown defense.

NFL
The New York Giants took on their arch-rival Dallas Cowboys at home, falling to the desperate ‘boys 33-20. Under new head coach Jason Garrett, Dallas (2-7) displayed grit and determination against a flat Giants team. New York (6-3) looks to rebound next week in Philadelphia against the Eagles.
The New York Jets recorded their second consecutive week with an overtime win over the Cleveland Browns. The Jets escaped last week’s game against the Lions with a comeback in the final minutes of regulation and quick field goal in overtime. This week was quite similar, with Santonio Holmes making a deciding catch in overtime, however this week taking it in for the score. The Jets face off against the Houston Texans on Sunday at the Meadowlands.
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick and company trounced the Washington Redskins on Monday Night Football 59-28.

Have you ever considered where graduate students were living this semester? How about the number of graduate students actually dorming? Jennifer Fuoco, the director of residence life, has informed the Pioneer that there are currently 92 graduate students living on campus and that the total number of graduate students living on campus has changed over the years. Fuoco added that, “This number has changed from year to year and is currently up by six from last year at this time.”
Various factors can determine why most graduate students choose to live off-campus.  Sean Manning, a graduate student studying medical microbiology said that “since [he] lives near the school, he doesn’t see the point in living on campus.” Jessica Blumenthal, a graduate student studying social work, agreed with Manning. Blumenthal said that she doesn’t live on campus because she “lives 30 minutes from the school, so for me, it is not worth paying for housing on campus when I can live at home for free.” Although their reasons seem plausible, living on campus can also have its advantages.
Blumenthal went on to say,  “During my undergrad., I was in Maryland and paid for housing, both in dorms and in an apartment, so I already had the experience of living somewhere else.”
The director of residence life also provided a tentative explanation as to why graduate students choose to live on campus. Fuoco said, “living on campus seems to appeal most to graduate students who are enrolling in graduate coursework immediately after finishing their Bachelor’s degrees.  For students who have been out of the residence halls and away from campus life for a year or more, the idea of living in a residence hall, having a roommate, and sharing a community bathroom may no longer be something that works with their lifestyles or schedules.  Some graduate students are also completing their coursework while working full-time and may choose to live closer to their workplace.”
Though living off-campus may be suitable for someone seeking a different experience of being in another environment that is more private and confined, few graduate students agree that living on campus can be an advantage. A graduate student, who wished to remain anonymous, said that when “you live on campus, [you] meet a lot of people and don’t have to deal with all the traffic of commuting, and you get more involved with school related activities. And, living on campus also allows you to work.”
As you can see, there are many things that can influence a person’s choice in deciding whether to dorm or not.  One can agree that graduate students, although one may  think there are none on campus, do make up a significant percentage of the student population on campus. If you still unsure about whom the graduate students are, try networking through the residence halls; you bound to come across a graduate student more quickly than you would think.

C.W. Post students were able to express their Post pride with a Pep Rally on Friday, October 21st, at 7 p.m. in the gym of the Pratt Recreation Center. Sponsored by The Association for Campus Planning (ACP), the Pep Rally had a number of events for students to enjoy.
The night included the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place winners of the talent show giving an encore of their winning performances. Homecoming banners were proudly displayed, clubs were acknowledged, and the Student Dance Association and Pioneerettes dazzled the crowd with their own performances. And, last but not least, students showed their Post pride to the football team before the big homecoming game. What’s not to love about pep rally?
In addition to the performances, there were also free food and drinks offered to the crowd, along with some green and gold pompoms and foam fingers to cheer with. And, ACP didn’t stop there. It also threw free C.W. Post t-shirts into the crowd and had a D.J. blasting music throughout the event to keep the students pumped up.
Sally-Ann Gaughan, a junior early childhood education major, was surprised by this year’s pep rally. “It was better than I thought it would be. It had more school spirit. It was just awesome.”
Anna Smith, a freshman with an undeclared major, also enjoyed pep rally, saying, “I liked it and thought it was really good. The music was also really good, too.”
This year’s Pep Rally did just what it set out to do: get students pumped up for the big Homecoming game, and allow them to let loose and have some fun.

Conversations Helping and Teaching Stu¬dents, C.H.A.T.S., a program created in 2009, is in the process of becoming an official club at LIU Post. In C.H.A.T.S., an American student and an international student are paired as partners so the two can learn about each other’s cultures and become friends. This gives the internationals students the opportunity to improve and practice their English. 
The offices of International Student Services and Religious Life created C.H.A.T.S. in 2009 and act as co-sponsors for the organization. This semester, C.H.A.T.S. has begun the process of becoming an official club by creating an executive board and attending three Student Government Association meetings. The new executive board consists of five students: Alize Margulis, Rika Tatsukawa, Arti Jain, Terry Chang and Serena Oditt, who will attend the Student Government Association meetings to represent C.H.A.T.S. Father Ted, who is in charge of the Newman Catholic Club, and Jeanette Murray, who works at International Students Services, advise the students. Three coordinators oversee the organization Murray, as well as Trica Figuero and Dr. Leslie Bai. 
“Make another friend; you always need a friend,” said Figuero. C.H.A.T.S. was created to try to build up the connection between international and Americans students. It also serves to improve international students’ command of the English language, allow international students to learn more about American culture, and permit American students to learn about different cultures. This may lead to inviting their partner home for Thanksgiving, and even visiting their partner’s country, said Bai. “International students feel intimidated and lonely. If they find someone who knows American life, they can meet through C.H.A.T.S. first and then become friends later on their own,” said Bai. 
All the C.H.A.T.S. partners are the same gender and are partners for one year. The partners usually meet once a week for about an hour. When, where, what you do and for how long you meet are entirely up to you and your partner. There are also monthly group events for everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. One of the first events this semester was International Friendship Night, which was held on September 20 in the Chapel. The event consisted of games, dancing, food and international trivia. The next event is a presentation on exploring New York on October 11 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. There is an Inter¬national Education Week Dinner planned for November 12 at 7 in the Tilles Center and a farewell party on December 6 at 12:45 p.m. in the Chapel. “The events are open to everyone. We are always encouraging and welcoming visitors and new members, if interested,” said Bai. 
There is an application form which helps with the pairing process. Students fill out their major, hobbies and if they have a preference of what type partner they would like, said Bai. She said last fall there were 50 pairs, last spring there were 39 pairs, and there are currently 27 pairs. However, students join throughout the semester. Students, faculty and staff are all members of C.H.A.T.S. The staff members who are involved in C.H.A.T.S. are Trica Figuero, Dr. Leslie Bai, Jeanette Murray and Nadia Hernandez, who all work at International Students Services. 
“The biggest headache now is there are always more international students then American students,” said Bai. Many international students are waiting for a partner. Bai said new international students are their first priority but returning international students are also waiting. There is a lack of male American students. Many American students are needed and males are needed the most right now, said Figuero. “We have included staff members, and some domestic students take two partners,” said Figuero, to try to solve the problem of not having enough American members. “We try to recruit students at (club) fairs, but it is always hard to get them to commit,” said Bai. 
Bai said many show interest in C.H.A.T.S. while they are recruiting but then they say they are too busy. “Some people are afraid of the commitment; time is an issue,” said Figuero. The coordinators say the group meeting and weekly partner meetings are not mandatory. The events are held so that everyone who is involved in C.H.A.T.S. can get together and do some sort of activity. As long as you are spending individual time with your partner, you do not have to attend the events. C.H.A.T.S. is extremely flexible. “It’s not something to be fearful of or stress out about; just try it” said Figuero. They said they want more American students to learn from this experience. “You don’t have to do something extra; you can bring your partner to something you go to already,” said Bai. 
Being a member of C.H.A.T.S., and acquiring knowledge about another culture, will enhance your resume and work experience as well, said Figuero. Clubs can also pick up partners. Every club on campus has to do a certain amount of hours of community service and earn points for it. If you are on another club on campus and need to earn community service points, you can earn them by joining C.H.A.T.S. If there are a few partners per club, they will give you about half of the points needed. “Internationalization, we want more students to open up, even make our campus a little different,” said Figuero. 
Rika Tatsukawa, a senior Public Relations major from Japan, has been a member of C.H.A.T.S. since September 2011. Tatsukawa was partners with Arti Jain, a junior English Education major, last year. The partners are continuing to work together through C.H.A.T.S. this year as well. “At first, I didn’t expect her to be such a good friend and now I can’t image campus life without her,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she meets, texts and messages her partner often. “I meet Arti at her house a lot, her mother makes Indian food which I love,” said Tatsukawa. She said she went to her C.H.A.T.S. partner’s house for Thanksgiving, her birthday and Christmas. She also said she has met most of her family. “Now I don’t think of her as a partner; I just think of her as one of my friends,” said Tatsukawa. She said that she and Arti have similar feelings to be kind to others and common sense. 
Taksukawa said that C.H.A.T.S. has made her more compassionate to others, especially foreigners. “If I go back to Japan and see foreigners, I want to take care of them and help them because now I know how they feel. Taksukawa thinks that American and inter¬national students can learn a lot from each other. “I wish American students can learn from International students. In the future, it can help them with their work if they know that culture,” said Taksukawa. She said she taught her partner how to say hello in Japanese, “Konnichiwa,” and thank you, “Arigato.” 
Alize Margulis, a junior International Studies major has been part of C.H.A.T.S. since she was a freshman. “I joined C.H.A.T.S. because I thought it was the best way to learn about other cultures and customs,” said Margulis. Her first C.H.A.T.S. partner was Winny Wang, a graduate student from China studying Science Research. She said she found similarities between Wang’s culture and her own. “Winny almost always boils water and drinks the water as such; whereas I would boil water but I would drink it only if I had diffused a tea bag,” said Marguilis.
Last year, Marguilis and her former partner, Kotona Uzumaki, a Business major from Japan, were C.H.A.T.S ambassadors. “We spoke at various C.H.A.T.S. events and were nominated and received certification for Outstanding C.H.A.T.S. Partners of the Year 2012,” said Marguilis. She said her past two partners have become her really close friends. “Kotona, who was studying abroad in the U.S. for one year was in two of my classes , and once we became C.H.A.T.S. partners, we went to various club events on campus and explored off campus too,” said Marguilis. She said she feels she taught her partner how to be comfortable in her home when inviting her over for holidays and dinner. Marguilis said her two past partners taught her many phrases in Chinese and Japanese. She said she and Uzumaki would see shows in the city and at the Tilles Center as well as spend time in her neighborhood. Marguilis still keeps in contact both of her C.H.A.T.S. partners through Skype and e-mail. “I’m hoping to travel to Asia one day, so I know I will be able to explore their countries with them too!” she said.
This year Marguilis is partnered with a student from China named Shuai Shuai, but she has not met her yet. She said she wishes more American students joined C.H.A.T.S. “LIU Post provides this opportunity through the C.H.A.T.S. program, but I feel not enough domestic students are committed or interested in becoming a partner. I understand many students have busy agendas, but how complicated is it to take one hour per week out of your time to meet with some one?” said Marguilis.
She said she has truly enjoyed her experience as a member of C.H.A.T.S. “Inter¬national friends have certain values that we as Americans don’t. I am not bashing Americans, but we should embrace other cultures and be open to learning about them, especially in this globalized business world that we live in today,” said Marguilis.

LIU Post was offered a special opportunity to display President Lincoln’s only surviving handwritten draft of the emancipation Proclamation in the Tilles Center of Performing Arts at the “First Step to Freedom: Abraham Lincoln’s Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation” exhibit. The final version of the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect on January 1, 1863, was destroyed in a fire in Chicago in 1871. The draft is the only remaining copy, which led to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom of slaves. The New York State Legislature purchased the draft in 1865 days after Lincoln passed away.
LIU Post is the only Long Island exhibitor of this rare document while it goes on a state-wide tour to mark the 150thanniversary of one of the nation’s greatest accomplishments. LIU Post and the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts are pleased and honored to join with the New York State Education Department and SUNY College of Old Westbury in presenting these national treasures to the community,» said Dr. Paul Forestell. Along with Lincoln’s draft, a speech delivered by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the centennial anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation is also on display next to the draft. 
Students who have seen the historical document expressed their admiration for it. “I think it’s great we we’re able to see a part of history in the Tilles Center,” says Mitch Mark, senior Psychology major. “It’s almost like reliving a part of history and it’s really special.” Matt Aronberg, an Information Studies graduate student says, “It’s amazing how a piece of paper was able to change so much of our history and to make our country the way it is now.”
At the opening ceremony held in the Hillwood Commons Lecture Hall during Common Hour, Dr. Forestell, Dr. Steinberg, Dr. John B. King, Jr., Andrew P. Jackson and Robert Tilles reminded visitors that freedom and equality hasn’t been reached yet. Robert Tilles explains to those in attendance the segregation on Long Island. “We have pockets of poverty. We drove along the road between the high and low performing [school] districts, and you see people across the street here look at people across the street there saying, ‘how come they get the best education and how come we get the worst education?’”
Both historical documents were on display for the public with free admission on October 15 and 16 from1 pm to 9 pm. The exhibit was offered in partnership with LIU Post, LIU Votes and the Tilles Center of Performing Arts.

The LIU Post football team ended its four-game losing streak by defeating the Millersville Marauders (2-6) on Homecoming by a final score of 20-15. Sophomore quarterback Tyler Heuer started in place of injured sophomore quarterback Steven Laurino, and helped lead the team to a much needed win in front of a packed house at Hickox Field on Saturday, October 20.
The Pioneers (3-4) had no trouble putting up points through the first 30 minutes of play as the team led 20-6 at the half. The highlight of the day took place early in the first quarter when Heuer jump-started the offense with an 82-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Kamron Palmer. Following an interception by senior defensive back D.J. Young, Heuer and the offense were put in great starting field position to do some damage at the Millersville 29 yard line. Senior running back Thomas Beverly capped off the drive with a one-yard touchdown run for his second rushing touchdown of the season.
The Pioneers finally got off to a solid start like Coach Bryan Collins has preached all season long. However, on the first play of Millersville’s ensuing drive, junior running back Ian Sadon busted out a 75-yard touchdown run make the score 13-6 in favor of the Pioneers early in the second quarter.
The Pioneers once again capitalized on Millersville turnovers. Junior outside linebacker Tommy Williams intercepted a pass and nearly ran it the distance for a touchdown. The offense of the Pioneers needed only one play to take a two score advantage as junior linebacker Rob Bright barreled his way into the end zone for a touchdown. With that score, the Pioneers had a comfortable 20-6 lead at the break.
In the second half, Heuer and the offense did not show up as the team did not even threaten to score once during the final 30 minutes. The Pioneers’ defense came up clutch on Homecoming as it forced four turnovers and limited the Marauders to only 15 points all game. Sophomore defensive lineman Joseph Thompson was a game-changer as he led the Pioneers with two sacks, while senior linebacker Anton Rukaj had a team-high 10 tackles.
With the defense playing so well, the offense had to hold onto the ball to avoid the Pioneers losing the fifth straight game. Late in the fourth quarter after throwing his second interception of the quarter and third of the game, Heuer was pulled in favor of Laurino. For the game, Heuer was 11-20 for 113 yards, one touchdown, and three interceptions through the air. However, Heuer was efficient on the ground rushing the ball 19 times for 137 yards. With less than four minutes left to play, Laurino entered the game with a broken left hand and a broken right thumb ready to close out a Pioneers win. And he did just that. Despite not throwing the ball once, Laurino had three rushes for 11 yards, protected the ball, and moved the chains to seal a Pioneers win on Homecoming.
The Pioneers have the team’s final home game this week on Saturday, October 27, at 1 p.m. when they square off against the 3-4 East Stroudsburg Warriors.

After 13 months of campaigning, rallying, and debating, Barack Obama will begin his second term in the White House. Although he beat former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in a landslide in electoral votes, he was not as popular amongst all Americans.
According to A CNN article published this month, “Obama takes key battlegrounds to win re-election” by Tom Cohen, Obama won all battleground states as well as Romney’s birthplace of Michigan and his governing state of Massachusetts, with 332 electoral votes. Romney won 206 electoral votes.  Obama needed only 270 electoral votes to win the election. But, Obama did not win the popular vote with such a wide margin. According to the BBC U.S. 2012 results, 50.5 percent of the country voted for Obama while 47.9 voted for Romney, leaving the nation divided.
In Chicago, Obama supporters roared and cheered once Obama’s victory was announced, while television networks showed coverage of Romney supporters somber and crying. Republicans still had hope since Fox News Analyst Karl Rove had reported that Romney might still have a chance in winning Ohio. Shortly after Obama won the battleground state. After Romney’s concession speech, one Romney supporter stated that the fact that Romney lost was “a tough pill to swallow.”
A new Romney appeared on stage, less aggressive and more somber than we’ve seen him in the past months. An hour after news networks projected Barack Obama as victor, in Boston, Romney, whose eyes appeared to be red and watery, conceded, “I pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation. The nation, as you know, is at a critical point. At a time like this we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing. I believe in America, I believe in the people of America.”
In Barack Obama’s acceptance speech, he stated, “Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs – not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties to meet the challenges we can only solve together…..We’ve got more work to do.”
Changes promised for students under Obama’s Presidency:
Student debt has reached $1 trillion for the fist time in history. Students will begin to see Obama’s Pay as You Earn program reiterated on certain websites where students can apply for loans. The Pay as You Earn program, which will be in effect in 2013-2014, caps monthly federal student loan repayment at 10 percent of one’s monthly income. This is so students have more money to spend and invest in the economy, according to Barackobama.com. Also, under this program, a student can choose the college they want to attend based on their career goals and not solely on the price of tuition. In addition, if one pays their federal loans on time and at least at 10 percent of your monthly income as a teacher, service person, or doctor, one will be forgiven of federal loans after 10 years. For all other professions, if loans are paid responsibly, one will be forgiven in 20 years.
The Know Before You Owe program is a form that includes loan interest rates while differentiating between grants and scholarships, showing students exactly what they will be paying, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Board and the U.S. Department of Education. The form would also be introduced as a universal Financial Aid document that all colleges would be urged to adopt by the 2013-14 school year. This would allow students to see what they are being offered and how much they could possibly pay, before they accept the offer to attend that school. President Obama also insured that veterans and service members would be able to get a college education and find work when they return from service by implementing and expanded the post-9/11 G.I. Bill, according to BarackObama.com.
He also proposes to make higher education institutions more affordable, even though a written bill has yet to be written out and plans lack details, according to “With Obama’s Win, Colleges Anticipate 4 More Years of Reform,” by Michael Stratford in Chronicle.com this month. According to WhiteHouse.gov, the official website of the White House, Obama stated, “Higher education is not a luxury. Earning a postsecondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs.”
The President will be inaugurated for his second term on January 21, 2013 in Washington D.C.

	Hurricane Sandy and the nor’easter that followed caused LIU Post to close for a total of 11 days, including weekends. In order for students to complete their fall 2012 courses in full satisfaction with the New York State Education Department requirements, missed classes will have to be made up, according to Beth Carson, who works in Registrar. 
	New York State mandates a specific amount of contact (instruction) hours, explains Carson. For a three credit course, there must be 2,250 minutes of contact hours not including out of class work.
	The rest of the fall semester’s academic calendar has been revised as well. Make-up classes for the hurricane will be scheduled on Fridays, Saturdays and during common hour. It will be up to the professor to determine which days and times will be used. Wednesday, December 12, will be a mandatory make-up day for classes. 
	Classes that were cancelled due to the nor’easter will be made up as follows: evening classes cancelled Wednesday, November 7, will be made up on Saturday, December 15. Classes that were cancelled on Thursday, November 8 (2pm and later), will be made up on Thursday, December 13. Classes that were cancelled on Friday, November 9, will be made up on Friday, December 14. Faculty will be responsible to confirm all make-up sessions, times and locations with their students.  
	Final exams will now be held from Monday, December 17, until Friday, December 21. 
	The extra classes have been reported to add stress on some students. Jacob Maitland, junior business major, said, “I’ve had two rescheduled classes and one that really did me in.” Because of some scheduling issues, his parents are visiting him the week after Thanksgiving instead of during the break. His law class was rescheduled for a Saturday when his parents would be visiting. He said he reacted with “a lot of beeps, hash tags and stars.” The class is also expecting an exam that day. Maitland said that it was too personal to reveal his professor’s name; however, the professor allowed him to reschedule the exam for a later date so he could spend the extra time with his parents. 
	“Students should speak with faculty regarding any conflicts that they have with scheduled make-up classes,” Carson said. She added that if there are additional concerns made by the student that cannot be resolved by the faculty then they should speak with their chairperson or dean. 
Some students understand the need to make-up classes. “It was a whole entire week of classes, that’s a lot of days missed,” said Joe Nicastro, junior criminal justice major. He added that it’s better than extending the semester. 
	Natalie Post, freshman finance business major, said, “Mine didn’t bother me, but if I had a Friday class, I might be mad.” She normally works during common hour and did not mind missing one day of work but still referred to it as money coming out of her pocket. 
Softball players Kaci Hopkins and Nicole Hagenan, both criminal justice majors, were relieved that they did not have any rescheduled classes that interfered with practice. Their Earth Science class was rescheduled for common hour. “I’d rather have it at common hour because people have jobs and practices to go to,” Hopkins said.
Other universities fulfilled their missed days differently. St. Joseph’s College eliminated finals week to have more classes and Stony Brook University professors were just told to consolidate the course material and added no make-up days. 
“We can’t speak to how other colleges are choosing to fulfill their contact hour obligations. Additionally, not all Long Island colleges were closed for the same lengthy period that LIU Post was due to the consecutive storms,” said Carson.

In honor of Diabetes Awareness month, the Zeta Phi Beta sorority hosted a “Too Sweeeeet for Me” event on December 3. The event was created to raise awareness of diabetes and other health problems that might affect college students. It aimed to show students how to prevent getting and diabetes and the importance of staying healthy. This was their first event like this and around 15-20 people attended.
Ashley Noble, the sorority’s secretary and a senior Electronic Journalism major, started off by discussing her experience with diabetes. “I found out I had diabetes 10 years ago… I was back to school shopping with my mom when I fainted,” explained Noble after she presented a slideshow on the condition. “I’ve learned to deal with it. It’s easier now that I have an electronic insulin pump that I wear at all times.” 
Her presentation focused on acknowledging the four types of diabetes , which are: central diabetes that deals with damages to your pituitary gland, nephrogenic diabetes which deals with your kidneys, and dipsogenic diabetes that occurs from lack of fluids and gestational diabetes that affect women who are pregnant. The presentation also pointed out some of the symptoms students should look out for.
After going through the preconceived notions about diabetes written on a blue banner labeled “myth wall.” , one of the campus’ dietetic interns, Dana Fierstein, spoke. She explained that because Americans were not eating right or exercising regularly, more and more people are developing Type II diabetes. “8.3% of the American population has a form of diabetes but there are preventative measures you can take,” she said.  
She explained how blood sugar levels spike with too much food, illness, surgery, stress, or when necessary medicine is skipped. You can stay healthy, according to Fierstien, by eating breakfast, limiting late night snacks and alcohol, and increasing your fiber. 
“There are some crazy diets that completely cut out food groups, but they all work together to keep you healthy and your blood sugar stable,” added Fierstein.
Dietetic interns are the campus nutritionists located at the student health and counseling center and they are free to all students who have questions concerning health issues.
 “The event made me take a step back and be a little more careful about what I eat,” said Simone Medley a senior psychology major. “I’m not really a ‘sweet’ person but after the event I got my blood tested because I don’t really eat a lot during the school year. I am a lot more cautious now.”
            “I think the event was good but it could always be better,” said Noble. “I just wanted to speak about my experience with diabetes and keep people aware of… how to eat healthy in general.”

If you ever meet stranger with light brown hair who smiles and greets you with a friendly “hello” on campus, it just may be Information Studies grad student Matthew Aronberg, who has one of the most important jobs here at LIU Post.
Matthew is captain of Post’s Emergency Medical Services. He has been working for the school EMS for the last four years and is a licensed EMT.  Being an EMT runs in the Aronberg family. His parents worked on ambulances and wanted Matthew to gain experience in the medical field, which led him to become an emergency medical technician. Luckily, the school offers full time students who are licensed EMTs a position on the EMS team and tuition remission for those who apply. Matthew started working for the school during his second year of his undergrad career as an Information Technology major in 2008. “Balancing my time was hard when I was an undergrad,” explained Matthew, “but now it’s not so bad since I am used to it.” His daily routine at the start of his shift involves checking the ambulance to make sure all supplies are in order and the equipment is functioning and going on calls. Matthew said that most of the calls that the school emergency services gets are medically related all over campus, with a few traumas every now and then. Due to the HIPPA Privacy Act, Matthew can not go into detail on what the emergencies entail.
When asked how he manages working the overnight shifts, he jokingly responded with his eyes closed and “lots of coffee.” But all joking aside, Matthew admitted that those late night calls are usually emergency calls. “Calls in the middle of the night are definitely the hardest,” Matthew said.
Matthew not only works for Post EMS, but he also works for other ambulatory agencies when school is not in session. “Working on campus is very different,” he said. “Patients at Post are my peers that I go to class and live with.” Even though his job is to make sure these students get to the hospital safely, he tries to make friends with his patients so the route to the hospital is more pleasant and less awkward for the patient. Matthew finds working for Post EMS is an “amazing opportunity” because it is a great way to network and meet new people. “People are always interested in what I do when they see me in uniform or when I’m driving the ambulance around campus,” Matthew explained. “Working off campus, you tend to deal with random people and you definitely get a larger amount of calls.”
Matthew is graduating in 2012 with a Master’s Degree in Information Studies. He explained that he would “probably recertify for another three years” to continue his E.M.T. career, but after those three years, chances are he “will be working on a career with computers.” Nancy Aronberg, Matthew’s mother, gushed: “I’m proud of Matthew and all that he’s accomplished with his EMT career, but I know that he would be happier behind a computer screen helping to educate other people on today’s technology.
For aspiring students who want to be a trained emergency medical technician, Matthew advises them to “study hard and pay attention to small details in class” and to volunteer with ambulatory agencies to get some experience before working for an agency or for the school.

LIU Post’s Association for Campus Programming (ACP) had students hyped and anxious for Saturday’s homecoming with a week full of exciting events. Homecoming is a week dedicated to welcoming back alumni and also a time for current students to have fun, socialize, and partake in school pride. The week is very important to Post students for many reasons, and this year’s homecoming proved to be a success.
Jeremiah Aviles, sophomore Childhood Education major, said, “Homecoming is the core of LIU Post because it’s the anticipation of a crazy weekend.”
Main Events
Some of the main events were the pep rally, the homecoming carnival, the homecoming party, and the biggest event of the week was the homecoming football game.
The pep rally was held in the Pratt Center on Friday, Oct. 18. It was an enjoyable time for students to demonstrate Post pride and kick off the weekend. The pep rally consisted of performances by the Post dance team, cheerleaders, residence halls, and DJ S. Whit. The rally was also used to introduce LIU’s soccer, volleyball, swim, and football teams.
There was free food and Post giveaways for all guests. The Pratt was packed and the atmosphere was electric.
Alfred Cabera, sophomore Business Management major, believes that homecoming is the most popular school event throughout the year. “It’s the biggest social event of the year. Everyone participates in homecoming, even people from other schools,” said Cabera. “It’s a chance to meet your peers in a different environment.”
The Homecoming Carnival was a magnificent experience for students, families, and guests. The carnival was held in the Pratt and at Hickox Field at noon on Saturday and continued until 4 p.m.
Admission for the carnival was $15 and included a ticket to the football game and a barbeque lunch. There were rides, games, and club tables with promotions and activities.
Student Thoughts
Jesus Cardenas, senior Business and Film major, has always been excited and anxious for homecoming. “Homecoming has always been a time to take a step back from work and have fun with new and old friends,” he said.
“I’m excited about this year because Post is in a remodeling stage and we can make this the biggest homecoming and start new traditions with a new name,” he added.
The Homecoming Party is an annual celebration held on Saturday night for all LIU Post students and their guests to enjoy. The party has usually been held in the basement of Winnick, but this year it was moved to the Pratt Recreation Center to allow room for a greater audience.
Admission to the party was $5 for students and $10 for guests. Student Life, ACP, and a combination of student clubs and organizations hosted the party. The festivities were well attended and the venue was decorated with LIU Post colors and flashing lights.
Teresa Lisbet Ndong, sophomore International Business major, believes that this year’s homecoming was better than last year’s. “There were more fun activities this year, people seem friendlier, and everyone was having a great time together.”
Football Victory
The most important event of all is the homecoming football game. It’s the most anticipated event of the week, and the most popular. The LIU Post football team the Pioneers brought their “A-game” with them as they shutout Pace University in a 58-0 victory.
“I knew we were going to win, we were focused and ready to demolish Pace,” said Matthew Ferere, a sophomore defensive back for the Pioneers.
Homecoming 2013 was a great weekend for Post students to relax, have fun, and take a break from schoolwork just for a little bit. Most students enjoyed themselves and the Pioneer’s victory helped boost everybody’s energy.

Throughout his monthlong show on the streets of New York, the famous graffiti artist known as Banksy has turned the city into a giant game of treasure hunt this October.
Unveiling a new art piece on a daily basis, Banksy communicates with the public through social media and his website, banksyny. com. Posting only a picture of his recent work, and the located area, he leaves it up to New Yorkers to find the exact location—and they do.
People are getting swept up in the hype that is Banksy, and rush to see his art work before it is defaced. The mysterious artist, who remains unidentified to public, calls his monthly exhibit “Better Out Than In,” meaning that art is better on the streets where it is free rather than in a museum.
Banksy challenged authorites with his first piece. On October 1, he painted a kid standing on another kid’s back, reaching for a spray can inside a sign reading: “Graffiti is illegal.”
LIU Post students are captivated by Banksy and his mischievous work. Broadcasting students Rob Hairston and Karoline Onsrud defines graffiti as a visual way of seeing people’s thoughts, thus being art and a way of expression. “Graffiti is more accepted these days,” said Onsrud. “It started as vandalism, but it has developed into an impressive art form which is much more accepted these days. Banksy sends political messages that concerns all of us look at how his work makes all these people flock together!” she added. The British street artist has gone from being a cultural icon in the graffiti community to the name on everyone’s lips.
He wins his audience over with political and social messages, as well as creativity. There is often a double meaning behind his work. However, regardless of Banksy’s increasing popularity, graffiti is still looked at as an illegal action. Or is it?
Banky’s work has forced a new debate about the definition of graffiti. What started out in the ‘70s, with young people tagging their names on buildings and such, has evolved into a form competition with each artist “out-doing” each other.
Banksy has become a living example of how graffiti has expanded its limits. CBS New York reports that his drawings are being protected by plexiglass, and in some cases even by security guards.
The whole meaning behind graffiti has transformed from something that used to be an illegal action into becoming a legal way to make big money.
While certain building owners jump with joy when finding Banksy’s valuable paintings on their property, the NYPD and Mayor Bloomberg are less than enthralled by the brazen acts of the artist, according to CNN. “Graffiti ruins people’s property and is a sign of decay and loss of control,” Bloomberg said.
Despite Banksy leaving his marks all over the city, the NYPD is having a hard time finding him. The search after the elusive artist is still ongoing by law enforcement.
Although not legalized by law, there’s no doubt that Banksy’s work has opened people’s eyes to see graffiti as something more than just vandalism.

LIU Post’s new boutique, located in the old gaming lounge in Hillwood, attracted faculty, staff, and students to its grand opening, Nov. 12.

The anticipation was high as guests waited for the special ribbon cutting, which symbolized the official debut of Post’s first student-run store. Contrary to what might be expected at a grand opening, no food or refreshments were served. However, that didn’t stop the boutique from filling quickly with intrigued students, faculty and professional photographers.
“This boutique is a great way for students to gain hands on experience, and to become entrepreneurs,” said Christina Principato, a senior Accounting major, who works at the boutique.
Nicole Balnis, a sophomore Social Work major, was excited when it came to revisiting the boutique in the near future. “I think it’s pretty nice, and I like that it has nice clothes, that I can definitely see people wearing,” Balnis expressed.
Tamir Dayya, manager and representative, spoke out about the interest, the boutique’s aim, and its progress from the earlier stages. “We had the boutique up and running, from the ground up in two weeks. Everyone from the facilities, to President Cline helped us out. It was true, genuine, teamwork,” said Dayya.
“The whole point is to get the students to run it, so they can learn about executive choices, and envelop themselves in management that can be fun, but also hard work,” Dayya said when asked about the boutique’s purpose on campus. “Thus far, we’ve gotten nothing but positive feedback, and we are very proud of the work we’ve done up to this point,” he added.
“I think it’s a good idea but I don’t know how many students it’s really going to bring in as customers,” said Stephanie Morales, a sophomore Art Therapy major. Morales had a notion that the boutique would definitely draw in various eyes from every direction, but she was unsure if the interest would stay alive.
“Everyone that I’ve spoken to about it, hasn’t shown any real excitement, or interest about it,” she added.

With rumors of major changes coming to LIU Post within the next six months, the semester’s first Town Hall meeting, held by the Student Government Association (SGA), was a necessity, both to dispel and clarify all the speculations.
The Town Hall meeting on Wednesday, Nov. 13, was an open forum, which allowed Dr. Jackie Nealon, the university’s new chief of Staff; Dr. Abby Van Vlerah, the new dean of Students; and Alerie Tirsch, the director of Student Life, to answer questions from attending students about a wide range of topics, such as campus life and the rumored changes.
There have already been some big changes since the new President, Dr. Kimberly R. Cline, took charge of LIU on July 1, including the opening of a new student run clothing store and the restructuring of certain administrative areas of the school, including Admissions and Academic Advisement.
On the subject of rumors, Nealon quickly squashed the question that a Shake Shack was coming to the campus.
There has also been an overwhelming worry around campus that tuition would be raised, which could mean added financial strain for many students. However, Nealon stated that Cline has promised no more than a two percent increase in tuition until 2020, compared to the average of over six percent.
The Apple Store that is rumored to be opening in Hillwood is not going to be an Apple store. However, it will be a tech store that is licensed to sell Apple products, a rare affiliation that only a few academic institutions can claim to have, stated Nealon.
This tech store is also going to have a tech support bar, something students can take advantage of if they are having any kind
of computer problems. The Student Art Gallery is will be possibly used as a shared space, perhaps with another student run business similar to the clothing store. The Center for Student Information (CSI) is going to be used for another purpose, possibly another student run business, but no plans are set in stone as yet, which means no more printing in CSI, something that could raise concern among commuter students who use CSI for their printing needs.
“I often use the printing facility in CSI as a quick option as I am passing through Hillwood on my way to class. I hope that there will be an alternative printing facility that is convenient,” said Andreas Olsen, a graduate Political Science major and commuter student, who attended the Town Hall meeting.
With the Gaming Room already moved to the upstairs study lounge, there was worry among students that
the Recreational room, also located upstairs in Hillwood, would be made into something else, therefore diminishing the amount of study space in Hillwood. However, Nealon assured students that there are plans to revamp the Recreational room, making it a better facility for students.
“There is already limited space for commuters to study during common hour; allocating space for this seems essential for a commuter school, ” said Kristina Renberg, a senior Public Relations major and commuter student.
An interesting discussion of proposed student run businesses for Hillwood was also held. One hundred percent of the profits from these businesses, according to Nealon, will go straight back to the students, with 50 percent going to scholarships and 50 percent to the school’s capital fund, which will be spent on other improvements for students.
For the students who live on campus, a hot topic at the Town Hall meeting was the Winnick Dining Hall, and the major question was, “Will the food change and get any better?” Van Vlerah said, “Paul Carroll, the director of operations for Aramark FoodSservices, is willing to work with students to cater to their needs. We encourage students to take to resources like the SGA food committee to help communicate what it is they want.”
Brianna Pisano, a freshman and member of SGA, who attended the meeting stated, “Dr. Nealon often reassured the students of their worries by explaining that they want to expand access to study resources and entertainment all around campus rather than just in Hillwood.”
The Town Hall meeting, which was held in the Cinema during common hour, didn’t have a large attendance. However, for students it was an interesting and necessary meeting that began to bring clarification on a range of topics.

A Mexican Christmas celebration called Los Posadas was celebrated on campus, on Wednesday, Dec. 5. In Spanish, Las Posadas means “the inns” or ”the lodgings” and represents the Biblical journey of Mary and Joseph as they searched for a shelter in Bethlehem before the birth of Jesus.

“This is the Catholic event on Christmas season,” said Father Ted Brown, the chaplain at LIU Post’s Interfaith Center. “From nine days before to the Christmas Eve, Latin American Catholics do this custom every night,” he stated.
Traditionally in Mexico, people gather in a neighborhood home to have a party each night from Dec. 16 to 24. Children get dressed as shepherds, angels, Mary, and Joseph. An angel leads the guests carrying candles to the house—in this case, a dorm. They sing a carol to ask for shelter, and then the host sings a reply regarding their request. After that, guests are welcome to have a party. They end the party with a pinata shaped like the Christmas star. The last day of Las Posadas is on Dec. 24, which is followed by midnight mass, the celebration of Jesus Christ.
People who took part in the custom gathered in the campus chapel, and then the journey began. Students played pilgrims who traveled from house to house searching until they reached a designated home where Las Posadas would be celebrated. First, they made rounds to each dorm, carrying candles with them. When a group of around 15 students reached each dorm, they sang a carol such as “Joy to the World.” After going around the dorms, they went to the Interfaith Center, which is regarded as the shelter, and decorated the chapel.
“I came to join this because it sounded fun,” said Aimee Biernacki, sophomore Healthcare Administration major. “It is a good way to come together with other students, so I want to come back again next year,” she added.
This was the fourth celebration for Matt Mason, senior Criminal Justice major. “As it gives me [a sense of] community, I came to this since I entered LIU Post,” he stated. Mason added that he would have wanted join this seasonal custom even if he weren’t a Catholic.
“Originally, Las Posadas is a Catholic custom, but it is not only for the Catholic on campus” said David Armas, junior Sociology major, who is the vice president of the Newman Club Catholic Community, LIU Post’s Catholic student organization. He continued, “Las Posadas this year was really successful. Many people stayed [until] around 11 p.m. to decorate the chapel.”
The Interfaith Center is currently decorated with a Christmas tree, along with green and red lights. The decoration was done by those who took part in Las Posadas.

This fall, there have been incessant complaints from students about the shortage of food at Winnick Dining Hall, as well as the low number of staff members working at Winnick, which, according to diners, is causing delays and difficulties when it comes to servicing students during meal times.
Students have reported that they have to wait in long lines with bad service, and that they aren’t provided healthy options, or even fresh food. “The only options there are [at Winnick] are hamburgers and pizza and the salad bar is usually stocked with lettuce that has been left out and is brown,” said Melissa Nosel, a junior English Library Science major.
Winnick’s hours have also caused some grumbling among students. Nosel says that Winnick doesn’t open until 7.30 a.m. However, like many students, Nosel has an 8 a.m. class. As a result, she is unable to get breakfast before her classes begin for the day.
“The one station that I love is the pasta station and it is closed half the time to keep open the pizza station because they don’t have enough staff to run all of the stations,” Nosel said. “There are six or seven stations, and most of the stations are closed because there is not enough staff to run them. The lines are out the door because they have one worker at each station trying to feed thousand[s of] students at [a] time, especially during common hour. I can’t count the amount of times that there were no utensils, no cereal, and the vending machines were broken.”
The lack of healthy options poses a problem for some students, especially those with medical conditions that make them unable to eat certain foods. Stacie Palacino, a senior Child Education major who underwent surgery to remove her gallbladder, has been forced to eliminate fats and gluten from her diet. Palacino claims that Winnick told her that they would accommodate her dietary needs, but there are still not a lot of healthy options and the salad bar is never stocked.
Ultimately, Palacino made the decision in Fall 2012 to become a commuter because of the lack of dietary options provided for her in the dining hall. “[Living on campus] just wasn’t working,” said Palacino. “I’m much happier now. I can make my food from home and I know that I’m eating healthy foods that I can eat, and not the greasy foods [that were provided for me at Winnick].”
Paul Carroll, Director of Operations of Aramark, the food service provider at LIU Post, states that there are no staff shortages at Winnick, and certainly no food shortages: “We currently have no [worker] shortages at Winnick Hall with the exception of some weekend coverage that is generally covered with student workers,” said Carroll. “We have 55 union members at Winnick Hall, and [many of them] are long-term union members who have served us well. We have no future plans of any change.”
Carroll also stated that the complaints of food shortages are unfounded. “We currently have the same amount of stations open as last semester,” Carroll said. “This includes pizza, pasta, street food, grill, home zone, dessert, salad bar, vegetarian-yogurt bar, deli, continental breakfast and cold food setup. There are no plans currently to change any food options, however we did introduce two new meal plans for commuter students.”
Resident students are used to using the magnetic stripe on the back of their student ID card in place of using cash to pay for food. LIU has instituted a brand new meal plan for commuter students that provide them the same food services as resident students. When a full-time commuter student uses their student ID card, they will automatically receive $50 to get them started. Commuter students will be able to choose from a 25 Block Plan, which provides 25 meals per semester and 50 dining dollars; a 50 Block Plan, which provides 50 meals per semester and 50 dining dollars; and the Commuter Dining Dollar Plan, which allows students to add more dollars to their plans at any time.
Despite this change, resident students believe that commuter students will only face the same problems that they do when it comes to the food selection and services.
“I’m cutting down my meal plan next semester,” said Nosel. “I have a meal plan for three meals a day, and yet I don’t use it most of the time because there is no food there a lot of the time and bad service.”
There are students who feel as though most of their dietary needs are being met with only little complaint or concern. “Overall, it could be worse,” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. “If I avoid the chicken then I’m usually very happy.”
The Pioneer was unable to receive a comment from Administration; Abagail Van Vlerah, the Dean of Students, referred Jackie Nealon, the Chief of Staff and Vice President of Enrollment, Campus Life, and Communications. Nealon chose not to comment on the matter, but referred to Aramark.

Over the past couple of semesters, more and more students have been attracted to Hicksville for off-campus housing, causing an everyday struggle for students to board the free shuttle, which has a 25 person occupancy limit, to school in the mornings. As a result, the Office of Campus Life and the Student Government Association have worked together to improve transportation—and more options are underway.
Students, faculty, and staff are taking advantage of the shuttle services, and the same hours seem to appeal to them all. “9.00 a.m. is by far the busiest time,” said Ian Jonson, a freshman undeclared major who lives in the Hicksville area. “I’ve been at the bus stop 20 minutes before the shuttle is supposed to leave, and you could tell straight away it wasn’t enough.”
The excessive demand for the crowded morning shuttle buses leaves students with two options: to go hard or to go home. “Lines have been non-exist[ent], and those getting a spot on the bus have usually been those with the sharpest elbows,” Jonson said. Instead of taking the risk, Jonson and his housemates have given up the extra hour of sleep, and are taking the 8 a.m. shuttle instead to make sure they don’t miss class.
Recently, the Office of Campus Life and SGA have studied the issue, and together worked on changes to the shuttles. “Along with the SGA, we constantly monitor the transportation needs of our students and make changes accordingly,” said Abagail Van Vlerah, Dean of Students.
“Van Vlerah and I actually rode [the shuttle] last week sometime in the afternoon, to get feedback from students,” Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life, added.
The changes already in place have not increased the amount of rides to and from Hicksville; the latest round that used to leave campus at 9 p.m. has been taken away, and the shuttle is now going at 1 p.m. instead, breaking the previous almost six-hour break the shuttle used to have between 10:20 a.m. and 4 p.m.
“It is an expensive and year-round service, so we have tried to play around with the schedule before increasing any costs,” Berthel said. “SGA has allocated over $100,000 for the student shuttle service during the 2014-2015 academic year,” he added.
For those who dorm and don’t own a car, the off-campus shuttles to Hicksville and Pathmark in Greenvale have been the only free alternatives to leave the campus. “During weekdays, I try not to take the shuttle after its break in the afternoon because I know it will be completely full of commuters,” said Tine Markar Lolland, a junior Public Relations major. Lolland explained that the weekends are the only times she does not have any problems.
To facilitate leaving campus for on- campus students, the university will launch a new Zipcar program on Wednesday, Oct. 22, which will allow students to use an on-campus rental car all hours.
The Zipcar project is a global car- sharing network with operations at other college campuses throughout the U.S. Any student over 18, faculty over 21, or community member who has been a licensed driver for a minimum of one year (international licenses accepted) can apply. After registering online, and paying the annual membership fee ($25 for first year), students can reserve a car at any time of the day. Over the first month, students will be discounted for their first $35 driving dollars, according to William Achnitz, Campus Life Coordinator and Sustainability Coordinator. The rental will take place outside of Post Hall.
Jonson believes it is only fair to give the residents another option to leave campus; however, he wants to see some action taken on the free Hicksville shuttle, as well. “The shuttle is a service offered by the school, and you can’t offer services unless you can guarantee all those wishing to utilize it will be able to.”
Berthel stated that he understands where the frustration with the shuttle service comes from. “Students definitely have reasons to complain,” he said.
“The services are paid for by university and student funds, ultimately coming from student activity fees.”
SGA and Campus Life are considering further changes to the shuttle service that may affect the university wallet moving forward. “We are looking into a bigger bus,” Berthel said. “We are also thinking about moving the bus stop from the Chapel to the Humanities area where most departments are located; this way, students will get dropped off closer to the classrooms.”
However, Berthel warned students not to expect major changes any time soon. “Be patient. It is not going to happen overnight.”

As The Pioneer reported on Sept. 30, the LIU Post equestrian team set out to complete a daunting mission—raise enough money to rescue a slaughter- bound miniature horse, and make him the team mascot. The team held a bake sale during common hour in Hillwood Commons, posted flyers throughout campus seeking donations, and even created a web page on gofundme.com so that others could donate money to pay for the purchase and future expenses of the miniature horse.
After a lot of hard work and dedication, the girls were finally financially able to travel to the horse auction located in New Holland, Pennsylvania and choose which lucky horse would be coming home with them for another chance at life as their team mascot.
The mission took place on Oct. 13. Hope, a sweet palomino mare, caught the riders’ attention right away. Two of the three team captains, Cristina Bakos, a senior Speech Pathology/Pre-Med major, and Alex Diez, a junior Biology major, as well as one of the fundraisers, Christina Cepeda, a junior Psychology major, brought the mini horse to her new home in Bakos’ backyard barn in Nesconset, where she will have a much more exciting life with the other mini horses—and a donkey—already living there.
All of the money raised by the team will be put towards the many expenses needed to properly care for any horse, including veterinary and farrier appointments (hoof trimming), board, feed, wormer, shavings, and clothing. Hope had a warm welcome to the LIU Post equestrian team when she made her mascot debut at the annual Homecoming Football Game on Saturday, Oct. 18. For such a tiny equine, Hope handled the loud, crazy football game quite well. She tried her best to not get too overwhelmed.
“She was calm at homecoming, but would sometimes get startled with sudden, loud noises like popping balloons or the loud music, but eventually she got accustomed to the all the noise,” said team member Colleen Dreyer, a senior Public Relations major and the team’s Treasurer.
The day at homecoming was a success, which even included raising more money to care for Hope in the future. The equestrian team raised $1,110 through their “Go Fund Me” account, which is linked on the team’s Facebook page. To donate money to help Hope, you can go to www.gofundme.com/save- a-pony, or email christina.kotarski@my.liu.edu or christina.cepeda@my.liu.edu.
The next on-campus horse show at the North Shore Equestrian Center will be on Nov. 9, at 8 a.m. Hope, the mini mascot, will be there to show support. The event is open to the public.

Trailing 31-21 in the fourth quarter, the football team (7-3) scored 14 unanswered points on Saturday, Nov. 8, to storm back and defeat Bentley University (4-6) on Senior Day, 35-31, at Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium in Brookville, N.Y.
On their opening drive of the final quarter, LIU Post started at their own five-yard line. Bentley had complete control after scoring 24 unanswered points. However, red-shirt senior signal-caller Steven Laurino scrambled for five yards on the opening play from scrimmage, followed with 13- and 22-yard completions to red-shirt sophomore wideout Shane Hubbard and red-shirt senior wideout Kamron Palmer. The series resulted in a 16-yard touchdown pass up the seam from Laurino to junior tight end Sean Binckes, making it a 31-28 game.


Two possessions later, Laurino anchored another offensive assault. After starting at their own 47-yard line, Laurino completed four consecutive passes to set up shop at the Falcon seven-yard line. A few snaps later, the Boise native took a three-yard keeper into the end zone at the 2:41 mark to regain the lead for the hosts, 35-31.
With 2:34 remaining on the clock, Bentley looked to spoil the Pioneers’ rally. Graduate quarterback Danny Guadagnoli methodically drove his squad down to the LIU 25- yard line. Following back-to- back misfires through the air, Guadagnoli hooked up with Jet Kollie on a seven-yard strike to make it fourth-and-three. With only 16 seconds left and the game on the line, the Pioneers defense got one final stop as sophomore defensive lineman Kenny Scotland channeled his inner J.J. Watt and swatted away the fourth-down pass to secure the victory.
The Green and Gold got out to a hot start, as they scored on their opening series of the game. Laurino scrambled for a two-yard score at the 8:11 mark. In the early stages of the second quarter, the Pioneers capitalized off a Falcon turnover as Laurino hooked up with sophomore tailback David White on an 8-yard touchdown pass.
Heading into halftime, LIU Post held a 21-14 advantage. However, the third quarter belonged to the visitors as they gained their first lead after putting up 24 unanswered points.
That set the stage for another Pioneer comeback and Laurino’s late-game heroics. Laurino finished 34-of-48 for 363 yards and three touchdown passes. The fifth-year senior also ran for 74 yards and two touchdowns. Hubbard and Palmer each caught eight passes and accumulated over 90 yards receiving. Red-shirt senior wideout Chris McGrane had a stellar outing, catching seven balls for 92 yards. Binckes recorded five receptions for 45 yards and a pair of touchdowns.
The Pioneers defense saw red-shirt senior linebacker Anthony Brunetti lead the defense with 13 tackles, while red-shirt senior defensive lineman Dan Belfiore had nine tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a forced fumble. Red-shirt sophomore defensive back Justin Ortiz chipped in with six stops and two pass break-ups.
The Pioneers earned the right to play for the NE-10 championship on Saturday, Nov. 15. LIU will make the trip up to Springfield, Massachusetts for a re-match with American International. In their regular season, the Green and Gold were defeated by the Yellow Jackets 27-24. The Pioneers will be searching for their first NE-10 title since 2006. Kickoff is set for 1p.m.

LIU Post has announced that it will introduce two new schools to campus for the 2015- 2016 academic year: The School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering, and the Honors College. Jeffrey Kane, Vice President of Academic Affairs, believes this reorganization will increase enrollment, and be beneficial to the overall academic environment on campus.
The School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering will be an independent academic unit that will join the School of Business and the School of Professional Accountancy within the College of Management. Prior to the reorganization, the College of Management consisted of the following departments and schools: the School of Professional Accountancy; the Department of Social Work; the Department of Public Administration; the Department of Criminal Justice; the Department of Management; the Department of Finance; and the Department of Marketing.
However, the administration began to notice that certain academic units, such as the Department of Social Work, the Department of Criminal Justice and the Department of Administration, didn’t seem to fit within the College of Management, according to Kane. “These very disparate group of units couldn’t be called the School of Business because you can’t include Social Work as a part of the School of Business. You can’t call Criminal Justice a part of the School of Business. As a result, they created an umbrella term called the College of Management. However, the problem with that is that it created a lot of confusion on the outside,” Kane said. One of the reasons for the creation of the School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management was to expand on areas of growth and development such as computer science, according to Kane. “One of the main objectives [of the reorganization] is for students to realize that we do have Computer Science at this university. If you look at the Department of Labor statistics and look at the area of growth in the job market where our students can get really good and professional careers started and developed, there’s a heavy emphasis on computers. There is a tremendous growth area in the job market for this new school will initially be small, but he stated that his goal for the school is for it to grow, and ensure that students have careers ahead of them that “will serve them well and make them happy and productive people.”
“I’m fine with the idea as long as it doesn’t interfere with my graduation date,” said Kristy O’Connell, a junior Marketing major. However, according to Kane, the new school will have no impact on individual students because it will not change the already pre-existing courses or the majors offered on campus. “If you’re in accountancy, then you’re still in accountancy. If you’re in business, then you’re still in business. If you’re in social work then you’re still in social work. None of this has an effect on the program that you are enrolled in,” Kane added.
Project Management, a new program that will be offered in the fall in the new school, is a graduate level program now at the approval stage. A degree in Project Management will give students the skills to oversee all aspects of a project, including planning, budget, project control, strategic issues, value management, human resource issues, and legal issues.
The establishment of the Honors College will give LIU more prominence, attract more students, and promote the academic environment on campus that is devoted to students and their academic needs. “I believe that we have one of the finest honors programs in the country,” Kane explained. “When it’s called a program, it seems to have a lesser status than, let’s say, the honors colleges at other universities. It gives the appearance, although a misguided appearance, that the program here is of lesser significance. We want to promote that program and raise recognition of the role that it plays at the university.”
“I feel very positive about this because [it] is a direction that many universities across the country are taking,” said Joan Digby, a Professor of English and the Director of the Honors Department. “It makes us more competitive to be a college rather than a program. I think that it will even encourage students that are already going to Post to apply to be in the honors program, knowing that their diploma will read that they graduated from an Honors College.” Digby continued, “My primary goal is to expand the number of students in the Honors College because that will permit us to offer more courses and advanced electives every single semester. I’d like to try to get an additional 100 or 150 people by next fall so that there [can be] more course offerings.”
Starting in the fall, when Honor students graduate from Post, their diploma will state that they graduated from an Honors College, according to Digby. Honors program students will automatically be moved into the Honors College next fall. The Honors College will keep the same reporting schedule, and will not be structurally different; however, students will have more opportunities being a part of an Honors College rather than an honors program. Digby predicts that as the Honors College at Post develops in connection with LIU Brooklyn’s new Honors College that Post and Brooklyn will have more programming together.
“It might mean that our Pre-Pharmacy students might want to take some courses at the Honors [College] at the Brooklyn campus, or other students from Brooklyn might want to come do a semester to concentrate on Theatre or Music at Post, where we are very strong,” Digby said. “The benefit of all of this, that as a director of a college, I’ll be able to work more directly with the deans of the other colleges so that I will have more input in terms of getting faculty to teach an honors course, and getting faculty to advise research for honors students.”
“If we can be more successful in letting people know what we have, then hopefully we can attract students from different regions, [and] not just the local area,” Kane said. “A dream of ours at the moment would be to open up an honors dorm.”
This fall, the Honors office was moved from Humanities building to room 202 in the Winnick Mansion. Kane believes the change of location of Honors from Humanities to the Winnick Mansion displays great symbolism for what it represents to the university. “Just look at the new location. It’s on the top of the hill in [the] beautiful Winnick Mansion. It promotes the message of, ‘Hey we’re proud of this thing.’ It’s not one program among many. It’s the gleaming top.”
As of now, a dean has yet to be appointed for the School of Computer Science, Innovation and Management Engineering, and there is currently no deanship for the Honors College. Dr. Digby will remain the director.
“You can think of these changes as a statement of our aspirations. The real impact is telling people what we aspire towards and what we aim to do in order to move the campus forward. It’s more a picture of where we want the campus to be rather than an administrative shuffling like it might appear to be,” Kane said.

Sean Brogan, who graduated from LIU Post with a B.F.A. in Film in 2011, has become a novelist. Brogan launched and self-published his first book on August 12, and is already hard at work on a sequel.
Brogan’s first book, ”The Shadow’s Relic,” a 400-page adventurous saga set in the late 1700s, was inspired by fantasy genres like the Harry Potter and Star Wars series, written with a cinematic imaginary for details. ”The Shadow’s Relic” is the first of a four to five book series, with number two—The Mechanic of Death—expected to be launched for the second half of 2015.
In the first novel, a killer who distrusts the idea of the recently united thirteen colonies uses his telekinetic abilities to steal a powerful weapon from the American government and build an army of dead. Kaie Ellinger, an assassin with origins unknown, and Curtis Reynolds, a former prisoner with superpowers, work together to protect the colonies from the awakened deadly creatures. But will they catch The Dark Warrior before he launches his final plot: to cull only the strong and worthy from his wake of death and destruction?
“I always loved film and still do, but I have such an active imagination that writing lets me go the places I can’t go in film right now,” Brogan said. “But I think studying film challenged me to think visually.” Brogan hopes to build an audience strong enough for the series to later become one for the movie theaters. ”While writing ”The Shadow’s Relic,” I was able to imagine it very colorfully in my head, and I could play the chapters in my mind like scenes in a movie,” he added.
The idea of storytelling came about during a screenwriting class with Professor Michael Atkinson in the Film Department at LIU Post. Brogan described being stacked with eight-page assignments every week as tough, but valuable, in his creative writing. ”It’s really nice to experience that freedom in taking a story wherever you want to go,” he said.
But Brogan’s first book did not start off in much of a red carpet setting. ”I worked full time at a Chipotle during the course of the book,” Brogan said. ”In order to stay on track, I’d have to clock out after every shift, take my computer into this back room we had, and just keep myself awake long enough to write a chapter—or even a paragraph.”
The writing process took him around nine months. But once he found the rhythm—and chapter one was over with—it remained pretty painless, according to Brogan. Editing was more challenging to get through, as he spent a year to review every little detail together with a hired freelance editor.
The decision of self-publishing ”The Shadow’s Relic” gave Brogan total freedom to attribute creativity in his writing. He uses a handful of characters. While they are all overshadowed with some sort of mystery or superpower, he reveals the source of actual people to be the most fundamental in his writing—including himself. ”I think you need to put a little of yourself into your characters,” Brogan said,  revealing that he wrote Sean Brogan, the series’ main hero,“a bit” after himself.
Self-publishing comes with more responsibility to control everything around the actual release. The traditional publishing market these days is competitive if one does not already have an audience, according to Brogan. He therefore relies on his website and social media accounts to grow support.
A free excerpt from the book, background information of the main characters, and contact information to the author can be found at www.shadowrelic.weebly.com. The book can be purchased in both hardcover as well as paperback version on www.lulu.com.

People might think that Greek life is all about the parties, cliques, and frat houses, because movies portray them that way. However, this isn’t the movies, this is LIU Post. At this university, there are no fraternity houses or cliques, but Greek life is a “community of students who are initiated into one of our recognized fraternities or sororities,” said Katherine Wieme, Director of Greek Life & Student Involvement, a position in Campus Life.
Wieme explained that it offers students opportunities to bond, strengthen leadership qualities, and network with alumni. There are 11 fraternities and sororities on campus: Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Delta Zeta, Phi Sigma Kappa, Tau Kappa Epsilon, Theta Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, and Chi Nu Alpha.
“We currently have over 250 students in fraternities and sororities,” said Michael Berthel, Director of Campus Life. “We are proud to now be home to some of the largest national organizations in the world and are excited to add Sigma Delta Tau to our community in the spring
[2016].”These organizations are not all the same; they have different recruitment processes, structures, and types of councils. The three types of councils are the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Association, or the Multicultural Council. Alpha Xi Delta, Alpha Phi Epsilon, and Delta Zeta are Panhellenic sororities. Tau Kappa Epsilon, Phi Sigma Kappa, Theta Chi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon are fraternities a part of the Interfraternity Council. Alpha Phi Alpha, Phi Iota Alpha, Delta Sigma Tau, and Chi Nu Alpha, are the fraternities and sororities that belong to the Multicultural Council.
“Being in a cultural organization differs from other organizations because we’re very passionate about our organization’s history and the meaning behind the letters; we take pride in the roots of where we come from,” said Richard Batista, President of Phi Iota Alpha, and a senior adolescence education major in mathematics. Batista also explains that one thing you learn is that you should “never forget who you are and where you come from.”
Each fraternity and sorority has a philanthropy that they partner with. “In DZ [Delta Zeta], we raise money and awareness for our philanthropy Speech and Hearing, to try to make a difference in other people’s lives,” said Nicole Cunningham, President of DZ and graduate literacy education major. Their philanthropy focuses on those that are affected by speech and hearing challenges.
“Engaging in community service projects and raising funds and awareness for various philanthropic organizations are fundamental components of being an active member of a Greek organization,” said Alexa Regina, President of Alpha Phi Epsilon, and a senior social work major. She mentions that AEPHI “values service, which has allowed me to give back to the community with the help of my
sisters.”It can be hard to find your place in college. Now that doesn’t mean your clique or “it” group, but a group of people that help you find yourself and enjoy your college and life experience. Greek life can help “students to find their home in a fraternity or sorority,” Wieme said.
“Joining Greek life is so important because when you join your org, you are also joining a community,” said Giovanna Domingo, Financial VP of Alpha Xi Delta, and sophomore accounting major. “Over the last year I have seen such a positive change in Greek life. Even if you don’t know a person and you’re wearing letters, you always have something to talk about because there is that common thread.” She explained that more people have joined, which has shown such a positive growth.
These organizations have made an impact on many students and the campus itself. “Joining Greek life has without a doubt been one of the best decisions I’ve made in college. It’s gotten me way more involved than I ever was before on campus and it’s equipped me with invaluable leadership opportunities,” said Jawaan Smith, VP of Phi Sigma Kappa, a senior arts management major. “Also, knowing you have 20 plus guys who always have your back and are there for you through your highs and lows is a great feeling. It’s definitely a rewarding experience.”
“We are proud that our Greek Life students are also active in student organizations, residence halls, athletic teams, and student run businesses,” Wieme said.
“Being in Greek life means being involved, but still the most important job is for you to be a student. The hardest part about Greek Life is time management,” according to Michael Aquilano, Programing Director of Phi Sigma Kappa and sophomore psychology major.
“When you join Greek Life, you become a part of something that is very active and you need to learn or already have time management skills. Especially if you want to hold and E-board or chair position,” he said.
Wieme explained that the Office of Campus Life serves as the primary advisor to Greek life, including all the governing councils, organizations, and individual members and that they support the growth of these organizations. Campus Life “maintains a Greek life expansion policy for any organization who is interested in becoming recognized on campus,” she said.
“All of our organizations are national with chapters across the country,” Wieme said. “Post students who join a fraternity or sorority will have the opportunity to attend conventions, network with alumni, and meet fellow members from other institutions.”
Berthel added that Campus Life, and the university fully support the fraternities and sororities. “Providing opportunities for students to take part in Greek life is very important to us and we will continue to look
for ways to grow and strengthen our current organizations and add new organizations,” he said. If you think Greek life is for you: go out and meet the different organizations during Greek week or Greek events, which are held every semester and maybe you’ll find your new home.

How many “selfies” does it take to settle on the “perfect” picture? How many times have you posted a “fire” picture onto social media, but your peers didn’t reciprocate (like the photo), so you deleted it? Although the players remain the same, the games and the rules of which the players play by, have changed ten-fold.
Once upon a time, well, really before all of these social media sites, we would look at each other on the Starbucks line, and make our judgments from there. However, “We now look at the person’s Instagram first, make our first judgment, and then we take it from there,” said senior history major, Kathy Rice. “I can name 1,000 times where some guy would like [my posts] on Instagram, I guess showing interest in
me, but then in person, no social contact, none whatsoever,” she added.
When Rice told me this story, I literally, “loled,” but this really is no laughing matter.
Let’s me ask you again, why does it take 200 pictures to get that one perfect selfie?! To be honest, folks, I think I have that answer. The mini photo shoot we partake in when we want to post a picture on social media is caused by something I would like to call, “Social Perfection,” a.k.a delusion.
I believe that social media is driving our youth to the brink of insanity as it causes them to feel the need to to “qualify” within their respective social groups. For example, Marcella Anteri, a Suffolk County High School physics teacher, recalled a story about one of her students and social media.
“One of my juniors, who will remain nameless, came to me at the end of class,” said Anteri. “That class, she did none of her physics homework, and totally bombed my quiz. She came to me, and before she could say anything, tears began pouring from her face.”
Anteri later revealed that her student’s disarray stemmed from her fear that she was being judged off of her social media posts. According to Anteri, her student told her, “I accidentally liked my friend’s ex-boyfriend’s picture, and they’ve been ignoring me all week.”
We all know being in high school can come with its times of social hardship to say the least, but if you think about it, social media just adds to that fire we deal with in our adolescent years. In the age of social media and texting, misinterpretation and cyberbullying have run rampant. It has led Mike Kurtz, a junior education major, across the street at NYIT to stop texting all together.
“You really wouldn’t believe how many fights [with friends] I’ve gotten into because I didn’t answer a text within three minutes, or reply ‘lol’ instead of replying ‘lmfao,’” Kurtz said. “I remember one time where a girl I was dating told me a joke, at which I replied [over text], ‘lol.’ She later texted saying, ‘I haven’t liked your attitude all day and that last text proves you’re giving me one right now.’”
“I never texted her back after that, because I knew where it was going to go,” said Kurtz. “If I have something to say, or want to talk to you then I’m just going to call you. I’m bringing back the phone call!”
Social media to me is a synthetic form of human interaction; a form of interaction, which in most cases that does us more harm than good. Yes, social media links us beyond the classroom and to each corner of the Earth; however, Instagram, Twitter, even Facebook, and Snapchat, have become portfolios, or as I’d like to call them, “baseball cards” to track our latest social undertakings, misleadingly presenting them to our peers.
Posting a picture of your lavish vacations, the new car, your selfie, taken from an angle that probably led you to sprain your wrist and shoulder, and not to mention your “following to followers ratio.” Social Media allows us to portray ourselves in our “best” light, and that’s great! What if social media just further enhances the saying “perception is reality,” in a world where everyone’s perception of each other is derived of social media. It makes me wonder if we are losing our authenticity, and that’s kind of scary. Well, too scary to me at least.

To the Editors of the Pioneer:
On Wednesday, I posted a response to the excellent letter Editor Caroline Ryan published in the Pioneer. In my post, I expressed admiration for the clarity of her argument, and sadness that a student newspaper faces such deplorable conditions in trying to report campus news. This stance of complete message control on the part of the administration is antithetical to the concept of academic freedom and freedom of the press. It is demoralizing to the student journalists and heartbreaking for faculty members who work with them. It also makes our journalism program a hard sell to potential students who want the experience of working on a vital and relevant paper, not a University Public Relations mouthpiece, and discover that cannot happen here.
I am writing this letter as an addendum to my brief Facebook post (which seems to have disappeared) after learning that copies of this week’s Pioneer seem to have been removed from the campus before visitors to Homecoming and the Admissions Open House could grab them. This has happened before. It also happens at the Brooklyn Campus. It is shocking to see this go on in a campus community. I am appalled that our administration thinks this approach is somehow beneficial to our university, when in fact it does damage to all of us.

Two of the five deans of the schools and colleges on campus are interim, acting deans. One was appointed earlier this year and the other was appointed last week. Only one of the five deans has been in place for more than a year.
On Oct. 6, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Jeffrey Kane, sent a campus-wide email stating Dr. Albert Inserra, the former president of Dowling College, has been appointed dean of the college of education, information and technology. Inserra replaces Louisa Kramer-Vida, who was the acting dean of the college of education, information and technology.
Vida-Kramer is the chairperson of the department of special education as well as an assistant professor in the department. She was approached to take the position of acting dean in mid-June 2016, and began the position on Jul. 1. Kramer replaced Dr. Barbara Garii, the former dean of the college of education, information and technology, who became the vice president for academic affairs of St. Joseph’s College on Jul. 18.
As the Pioneer reported in its Oct. 5 issue, Jeffrey Belnap, the dean of LIU Global, has been appointed the acting dean of the college of liberal arts, succeeding chemistry Professor Nicholas Ramer, who was the acting dean of the college from June 2015 to August 2016. Ramer replaced former Dean Katherine Hill-Miller, who stepped down from the position in 2015 and returned to her position as a professor in the English department.
Art therapy professor, Christine Kerr, became the acting dean of the college of art, communications and design on Sept. 1, succeeding Noel Zahler, who left the University in August.
Stacey Gopack, who was the acting dean of the School of Health Professions last year, is the newly appointed permanent dean of that school.
Only Robert Valli, the dean of the College of Management, has been in his position since 2015.
Some students have expressed confusion and frustration about the coming and going of the deans. Senior economics major Marvin Johnson has had positive experiences with going to deans for help throughout his academic career. Johnson feels that with many of the deans stepping down and the administration constantly needing to find new replacements, many students may begin to feel lost. “Some students have a unique bond with certain deans and by them switching up and resigning, it just makes the students feel not wanted,” Johnson said. “It’s like a puppy with a new owner.”

What does it mean to be a woman? Where and when did the concept of womanhood come to life? The answers to these questions can be found on the stage in PTC’s production, “Age of Elizabeth.”
Follow modern Elizabeth and her mother’s story of betrayal and her journey through a timeline of mother-daughter relationships in past generations of her family, and the lessons that were passed down by each; discover how the trials women had faced in the past impact the future and define womanhood.
Written and directed by Logan DeWitt, the idea for “Age of Elizabeth” arose from a topic of discussion on nature vs. nurture within DeWitt’s household, where she is the only biological child of seven. DeWitt started to question learned behavior to search for the reasoning behind womanhood.
“I started writing it about a year ago,” DeWitt said. The script is still changing and transforming as the actors go through the workshop and rehearsal process.
The cast consists primarily of women: five Elizabeths, following the usually male tradition of passing down a name, and one man who plays every male character within the show.
DeWitt wanted to center the focus on the women of the play, as opposed to the men, an attempt to pass the Bechdel test. The test identifies the roles of female characters within a play or film based on three questions: whether they are named, interact with other female characters, and talk about anything other than a male character. In the entertainment industry today, many films fail that test. This pushed DeWitt to have a female-driven show.
“It’s really interesting being in this specific show,” said Cayla Michael, sophomore musical theatre major playing as modern Elizabeth. “There are a lot of things that she (Elizabeth) goes through that is personal to me and other people in my life.”
An overbearing and involved mother pressures Elizabeth, an issue that Michael sees reflected in some of her friends. “It gives me a sense of what they must have gone through,” she said.
With all of the focus on content and meaning throughout the play, the set itself is made to be simplistic in a fair contrast. Containing a single chair, three hanging frames to serve as time dividers, and walls on the sides covered in photos, the set establishes a place in time without drawing too much attention from the messages of the story.
What DeWitt wants is for the audience to examine the relationships they have in their own lives and what messages they are sending to one another through their interactions, especially for women. “Are we building one another up,” DeWitt asked, “Or are we subliminally tearing one another down?”
“Age of Elizabeth” will be showing at the Rifle Range Theater on Oct. 28-29 at 8 p.m. and Oct. 30 at 3 p.m.

On Wednesday, Nov. 9 professors and students joined together to express their feelings about the presidential election by holding a sit-in during common hour in Hillwood Commons.
“The idea behind the sit in was to come together and find positivity and togetherness on a day that wasn’t so happy for most of us,” said Alexandra Mitchell, a senior musical theatre major. She didn’t want to call the event an anti-Trump campaign.
“It was a Pro-people sit-in where we wanted the students of Post to know that no matter who you are, what you identify as, and where you come from, you are important and your voice matters here.”
Taylor Bass, another senior musical theatre major, also partook in the sit-in. “It was a tough day. All of my classes were like funerals, both the students and teachers were in tears,” she recollected. “The majority of my peers are having their rights challenged by Trump’s presidency. It put my heart at ease to know that people were thinking the same thing as me and were just as scared as me.” Although the sit-in was peaceful, Public Safety and Dean of students Abagail Van Vlerah stopped by to make sure everything remained calm.
“I think the biggest part of this movement is that we do not emulate the behavior of our president-elect,” Bass explained.
“We will no longer tolerate those using his platform for violence. We will not be silenced by his presidency just because he isn’t fighting for us, we will fight for ourselves and for our rights as human beings in this country.”

Nov. 14 was in many ways a Monday like no other. Still reeling from perhaps one of the most tumultuous, momentous and historic elections in the history of American politics, Post’s theatre majors began their weekly retreat back to the classroom.
However, most, if not all theatre majors attending the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building that day were shocked with inspiration when they saw what was waiting for them on the chalkboard in the west wing of the building.
An anonymous creator left a platform for theatre majors to put their dreams into writing, for all of campus to see. The creator has yet to claim responsibility for the mural.
“It’s a board where everyone can talk freely about anything,” said Sabrina Ali, a freshman theatre major, who also works as a receptionist in the department of theatre, dance & arts management. “It’s completely anonymous, it’s us being ourselves.”
With her hands folded, Ali gazed at the mural and said, “We want to be free, and this wall is our outlet.” According to Ali, the mural only began with the words ‘Before I Die, I want to…” and since then, this outlet has grown every day, consistently, by the hour, with each student and one dream at a time.
While Ali was speaking, three students passed by the mural and one contributed, writing what she wishes to accomplish before her time comes: “Make Mom and Dad Proud.”
The mural of motivation has no names, signatures, or any other form of identification. Regardless of whether it’s an image, quote, or simply just a word, this mural allows members of the student body to peacefully and properly display their thoughts, their emotions, and their perspective.
“We seem to learn a lot more about one another when we reveal ourselves to one another,” said Jacob Lackey, a freshman undeclared major. “I think the mural humanizes us, and in a digital world, we sometimes lose touch of that.”
With no plans to remove it, the Theatre, Film and Arts Management Building mural currently remains untouched, located on the old chalkboard in the west wing of the building. Students who wish to view and/or contribute to the mural are welcome to do so as long as reverence is shown for classes that may be in attendance.

Former United States President, Bill Clinton spoke to a sold out audience at the Tilles Center on Thursday, Oct. 5.
The event, hosted by former U.S. Congressman Steve Israel and the LIU Global Institute, featured Clinton speaking for nearly an hour on topics including global issues, his wife’s presidential campaign, and the current White House administration.
The event then switched over to the Q & A session with Israel, focused on a number of important topics making news headlines today, such as gun violence, college debt, North Korea, and immigration.
Throughout the night, Clinton spoke about embracing our differences as Americans and working together. Our goal should be “to build more inclusive prosperity, more inclusive societies…and more inclusive politics,” Clinton said.
“In this age, you can build all the walls you want; we are still interconnected,” Clinton said. He stressed that it’s what brings people together that’s more important than the things that divide us.
Abraham Orenstein, a senior broadcasting major was one of the few LIU Post students who attended the event. He was impressed with the speech, although he described himself as a Sanders supporter. “I thought it was a really strong speech that focused on embracing our differences and coming together,” Orenstein said.
Clinton also spoke about the Electoral College which ultimately put Donald Trump in the presidency, although Hillary Clinton won popular vote. “Since I believe in democracy, I believe the person who gets the most votes should win,” he said.
The audience applauded when Clinton spoke about college affordability. “We should do whatever we can to have the maximum amount of people graduate debt-free,” he said, adding that our goal should be for every student from a non-rich family to get out of college without any debt.
On the topic of North Korea, Clinton said that North Korea’s Dictator, Kim Jong Un, has “done and said enough to be of grave concern.” However, Clinton admitted that he didn’t know much more about the current situation than what we read in the news. Clinton did however, caution our current administration, warning that we should know exactly what we are getting into before taking any action. The Trump administration should work with South Korea, China, Japan and Russia on handling North Korea, Clinton said. Israel asked Clinton what international challenge made him “toss and turn the most” during his presidency. “I was always worried about Osama Bin Laden and al- Qaida because he came from a wealthy family and he lived in a cave, which should tell you something – he believed what he was doing,” Clinton said.
Gun control, in light of the recent massacre in Las Vegas, was also discussed. “You do not need this to defend yourself,” Clinton stated about bump stocks, devices which allow semi-automatic weapons to mimic the ring speed of a fully automatic weapon. Clinton recommended “giving the voters the direct voice on this; they trust themselves more than they trust the politicians,” he said.
Michael Themistocleous, a 2017 Post alumnus who is the Tilles Center’s guest services manager, said that the Tilles Center staff worked with the Nassau County Police Department, the former president’s secret service, and the Old Brookville police to ensure everyone’s safety during the event. “I’m really happy about the Global Institute being a part of LIU. Steve Israel’s knowledge and connections can really enlighten everyone on campus, on both sides of the spectrum,” he said.
The Global Institute is partnering with the Hutton House for a book event on, “Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign” by Amie Parnes and Jonathan Allen. The event will be held in Lorber Hall on Oct. 25 at 1 p.m.

At 11:05 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 17, the office of Public Safety sent an announcement via email and text message notifying students and faculty that the library would be closed for two days. According to the notice, “the library will be closed effective immediately and will reopen Thursday, Oct. 19 at 12 noon. Efforts are being made to relocate the afternoon and evening classes that were scheduled in the library to other campus buildings. Class relocations will be posted at the library’s entrance. Updates will be emailed through LIU email.” The notification did not state the reason for the closing of the library.
In response to the Pioneer’s inquiries, Head of Public Safety Michael Fevola stated in an email that the library was closed because of wasp infestation. “LIU Post Facilities Staff and a contracted exterminator located a bee’s nest in the attic of the library and took immediate action to eradicate the nest and protect the health and safety of the public. The exterminator began professional treatment to remove the nest and treat the building. The treatment requires that the building is vacated for 48 hours.”
Faculty members with offices in the library were unexpectedly displaced due to the library’s unplanned closing. Classes were reassigned to rooms in different buildings. The Information Technology department was temporarily moved to the Browse store in Hillwood Commons. IT has “spread over what available space we have; they are utilizing the work room and the desk they already have for daily use. So far we’ve adjusted pretty nicely,” Albert Donor, a senior broadcasting major and Browse store associate, said.
Shaireen Rasheed, a professor of education, was the last professor to leave her office when she got word of the library’s wasp infestation. “I just took everything out of my office that I need for the next two days,” she said. “I’m trying to make a makeshift office wherever I can find wifi.” Rasheed has office hours set up for students to visit, she’s been holding meetings in Hillwood Commons. She had to post-pone a Skype meeting due to the lack of privacy available. Rasheed had just enough notice to remove her important belongings from the library so that her work has not been adversely affected by her removal from her office.
According to Fevola, rooms are reserved in Hillwood Commons for students to use as quiet study and computer space. Students who have questions regarding their classroom location may contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299- 2800.
Although the original notification informed students that the library would reopen at noon on Friday, Oct. 20, students did not receive a notice that the library had reopened until 2:13 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 20. The notice sent by Public Safety via the LIU Alert email system, stated that the library had reopened, thanked the community for its patience, and informed students and faculty that the library had resumed normal operating hours.
During this three and a half day library closure, students had to find other places to study, have internet access, and print out work. They were unable to take out books or use the library’s reference services, other than by email. Dean of Students Michael Berthel informed students by email that the library maintained virtual reference services to answer reference, catalog, and database questions via post-ref@liu.edu.
“The library faculty did a great job maintaining the online chat reference and email reference services,” Thomas Walker, associate dean of the college of education, information, and technology, and director of the Palmer school of library and information science, said. 


Students received no further notifications regarding the measures taken to remove the bees.

“Additional precautionary measures were put in place to ensure the continued safety of the community,” Berthel said.

On Friday, Oct. 13, the day before Homecoming, students were surprised to find 25 new yellow bicycles spread out across the campus, with multiple bikes chained to bike racks in front of Post Hall, Brookville Hall, the library, and between Nassau and Suffolk Halls.
Students received an email from President Kimberly Cline later that day, explaining that the new bikes had many uses, “whether it is rushing to your next class or squeezing in a quick workout.”
Students were expected to follow an “honor code,” according to the president’s email. Students were given the code “1954,” to unlock bike chains and to use the bikes at their own pleasure on campus, free of charge. Unfortunately, within days of their introduction to the campus, bikes were missing or damaged. Some bikes were hidden around campus, or taken into buildings and rooms to keep other students from being able to ride them. Another instance that occurred included the use of a personal lock to chain the campus bike.
Scott Carlin, the director of Center for Sustainability, is delighted that the administration offered on-campus bicycles to students.
Several years ago, students in the department of Earth and environmental science explored several alternative bicycle options for the campus. “Student research included working with third-party companies that manage and maintain the bicycles, [create] bicycle paths on the campus, and working to make sure that bicycles, pedestrians, and cars can share the campus safely,” Carlin said.
Carlin went on to say that it is not unusual for new bike programs to experience growing pains, and posed the same questions many students are asking. Should students be able to borrow bicycles anonymously or should they need an ID to borrow them? What happens with at tires and other maintenance issues? Who will be responsible?
Campus Life did not comment on the misconduct with bikes on campus. “We are excited to hear the initial feedback about the bike program. Students have been riding bikes around campus and we are happy that the program has been such a success,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said in an email. His email goes on to state, “As with any new program, we are constantly evaluating to determine future improvements and enhancements.
Students who have feedback regarding the program are encouraged to contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299-2800.”

At 6:57 a.m. on a rainy Monday morning, Oct. 30, an announcement was sent via email and text message to students and faculty notifying them that all Monday classes would be cancelled. According to the notice, “due to a power outage, all classes at LIU Post are cancelled for today, Monday, October 30. Faculty and administrative offices are closed. For Tilles Center call 516-299- 3100. Library closed.” Many parts of Long Island had lost power due to the heavy rains and winds throughout the night on Sunday.
The university sent a second email, an hour later, to inform students what services would be open on campus. “Public Safety, Facilities, Dining, and Campus Life staff are fully prepared to service the campus throughout the outage,” the email said. The shuttle bus service to Hicksville was operating on a regular schedule. However, the only available dining option for students was Winnick Student Center, which operated on an extended schedule from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The Campus Life staff held activities to keep students occupied during the day, including bingo and Monday night football in the Winnick Student Center Gold Coast room. Members of the campus life staff and resident assistants were available in the residence hall lobbies throughout the day.
Michael Berthel, dean of students, confirmed the buildings affected by the power outage. “On Oct. 30, several buildings on the LIU Post campus were affected by a power outage due to an off-campus issue. As a result of the outage, most academic buildings, the Pratt Recreation Center, Library, and Hillwood Commons were operating on emergency power,” he wrote in an email responding to the Pioneer’s inquiries. “LIU Post Facilities coordinated with PSEG to address the issue and return power to the campus. Without being able to open essential buildings, the decision was made to cancel classes for the day,” he said.
Sam Scarito, a freshman early childhood education major, lives on campus. “The power outage was pretty inconvenient for me. Post Hall was out for the majority of the night, and people were in the hallways doing their homework.
I wasn’t able to set an alarm and I honestly wondered if I’d wakeup for class or not,” she said. Notification of the school closure was sent via text message and email at 6:57 a.m., when many commuter students and professors were already on their way to their 8 a.m. classes. Jamie Leigh, a senior forensic science major, was driving to her 8 a.m. class when she got the notification. “I usually do not check my phone while I am driving but I had my phone propped on my dashboard while using a navigation app. I feel like this happens all the time. The school should know a significant amount of students commute to school and should have taken into consideration how far some students commute. One hour before the first set of classes is not enough time to notify students,” Leigh said. Freshman accounting major Amanda Norton was an hour into her commute to school. “I think they should’ve sent that message earlier. It’s dumb to wait until 7 a.m. when there [are] commuters with early classes who are already on the road. I wasted my time and gas,” she said.
Michael Semler, a junior international business major also leaves early in the morning to get to classes on time but feels that this power outage could have been prevented. “[The university] should make sure that anything at risk, like equipment servers, [are] secured and contingencies should be in place when equipment fails,” he said.
The Pioneer has previously reported on hurricane preparedness. In “Storm Preparedness In the Wake of Hurricane Nate,” By Jada Butler in the Oct. 10 issue, the Pioneer reported that many buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the event of a power outage. “Several buildings on campus are equipped with backup generators in the case of a power outage, those being Pell, Hoxie, Roth and Kahn Halls, Humanities, the Winnick and McGrath Houses, Hillwood Commons, the Pratt Recreation Center, the Little Theater and Theater & Film building, the Tilles Center, the library, and all in-use residence halls,” according to the Oct. 10 article. “All other buildings, including the Chapel, the music and sculpture buildings, the Fine Arts Center, and Lorber Hall are equipped with backup emergency lighting.”
According to Berthel, the outage was not caused by an on-campus issue. PSEG, the electric provider for Long Island, was responsible for repairing the power lines to restore power to campus. Power was restored at approximately 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 30. Classes resumed on Tuesday, Oct. 31 on a regular Tuesday schedule. Students have not received any notification about whether the Monday classes will be made up.

Despite the chaos in the world and reports of prejudice in the news, many minorities in the United States – blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and others – are excelling academically in college and thriving in life generally. Too often, we forget the contributions they make in our communities, socially and culturally. It is disappointing to see the rage that they experience when still being labeled as the minorities in our multicultural society. Students often feel stigmatized when labels are placed on them, often because of their socio-economic status. Many overcome the labels, however, soar through this issue and lead by example. Blacks, Hispanics, and other minorities in our communities should not feel like outcasts, because all lives matter.
Pablo Correa, the 2016 salutatorian of Hempstead High School, is a sophomore at Dartmouth College. Although he is undecided about his major, he is leaning towards anthropology, with global health and chemistry minors. He is also on the pre-med track. Before entering college, he was actively involved in his high school, serving as Vice President of the Hempstead High School class, Vice President of Club Truth, President and Refounder of Future Doctors of America, and more. Correa, who was born in Colombia, came to the United States when he was four years old. As high school came to an end, he became determined to face the next chapter of his academic career with determination and excellence. Yet, he felt like an outcast during the college application process. “I can’t say for sure that I have experienced racial profiling, but I have felt like an outsider in many different situations, most of them here at Dartmouth or when I was visiting other schools like Princeton or Cornell,” he said.
Correa has encountered moments when he felt uncomfortable sitting in class in college because he was the only racial/ethnic minority in the room. Yet, he has not allowed this to deter him from academic success. Correa continues to go to events on campus and he makes it apparent that he is a low-income, first generation college student. Correa became actively involved in Dartmouth’s First Year Student Enrichment Program. This program enables first-generation students to become used to the college environment. With the help of the director of the program, he became acquainted with the resources Dartmouth has to offer, which helped him in his transition into the new environment. Correa’s mother reminds him to ignore the connotations placed on him because of his race. He continues to give back to Hempstead High School students by returning to discuss Dartmouth and the college application process.
“While in college, it’s very important to focus on yourself and not where everyone else is at,” Correa said. “I know that’s a very difficult thing to do, but it is also important. The only person you should compare yourself to is your older self.”
Karen Lopez, the 2014 Valedictorian from Hempstead High School, is a senior at Columbia University, majoring in economics. She was born in El Salvador and came to the United States when she was eight years old. She is now happily living in the city. The transition from Salvador to the United States was difficult for her because English wasn’t her first language. As time passed, Lopez practiced English with the help of her third grade teacher. Fast forward to senior year, Lopez realized how challenging the college application was for her. She focused on Ivy League schools because of the need-based financial assistance. The competitiveness of applying to these schools drove her hunger to become intellectually challenged.
“Focusing on Ivy Leagues and coming from a school like Hempstead High School was hard in itself because I found people doubting me. I didn’t have too many people to look up to. I couldn’t speak to my parents about the stress of the process and I couldn’t look at anyone else in my family because I was the first one to consider going to college. This truly tested my perseverance as I questioned myself many times if I was good enough to go to a top college,” she said.
Lopez felt intimidated at first when she visited colleges and it was difficult for her to find her voice in a new environment. She saw that there weren’t many students with her racial background at the top Ivy League schools. This has driven her to work even harder in her school work to show that she can make it in life, regardless of where she comes from. Although it took her a year to embrace her culture at Columbia University, this was the time she needed. She decided to join Latinxs, a student organization on campus. This transformed her whole college experience.
“I realized that while I did like being exposed to different people, I also needed the space to spend time with people who looked like me and who were facing similar struggles. Through this organization, I met some of my closest friends and started to learn a lot from them about Latinidad and what it meant to be trailblazers in our communities,” she said.
Dondre Lemon, a junior journalism major at LIU Post who is black, was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts and moved to the Bronx when he was six months old. The transition from the city to Long Island was difficult for him when he arrived at Post.
“When I first arrived on campus, I did feel different from the other students because the majority of the students were from Long Island and I was a city kid that didn’t know certain topics students would talk about,” he said. Although this took a toll on him when he started at Post, his passion for unity of cultures drove him to become more interested in reporting and journalism. Lemon has demonstrated to professors and others that it depends on the individual, not the color of their skin. People would not have guessed that Lemon was a reporter in the Bronx while he was in high school. He demonstrated excellence by receiving an award for his reporting skills and by publishing two articles with the nor news. Lemon is a staff writer now for the LIU Post school newspaper and the creator of the new PTV- Pioneer news show. He is thankful for the support system that has helped him with his transition to the college environment.
“Almost every professor helped me in some way. A lot of them definitely made the transition easier for me and warmed me up to the campus. I definitely know my success coach helped a lot, making me feel comfortable, if I had any problems; I know I can go to her for anything. Having friends has also helped me, and what makes it better for me is that I am meeting new people of different cultures, which I feel everyone should have in their circle of friends,” he said.
Next year, Lemon will take an editorial position on the student newspaper. He continues to be an inspiration for students coming from low socio-economic backgrounds who may lack confidence in their abilities.
Lemon believes that the negative stereotyping and labeling needs to change. “The first thing I do is tell my friends of color not to classify any group. Don’t say all whites this, or Muslims that. Right now, we need to be together and be united, no matter the color of your skin,” he said.
As a reporter, Lemon wants to show others that they do not have to have a high socio-economic background or grow up in a wealthy community to make it in any career they desire. “If I can inspire one person that they can make it just the way they are, I will definitely feel like I have made a difference in the world,” he said.
Amoy Brown, 2016 graduate of Hempstead High School, is now a sophomore at the University of Albany, with
an English major and journalism minor. She was born in Jamaica and moved to America when she was five years old. Brown has also felt like an outcast in a college that’s predominately white. Growing up in Hempstead, people had expectations of how she is supposed to behave. However, she proves them wrong.
“My skin color is something that I have definitely became more conscious of,” she said. Also with the world today, it’s kind of hard to do anything without thinking about the barriers that race does cause.”
In Brown’s college environment, she has noticed instances in which she was the only black person in her class, but she didn’t let this hold her back. “Just because I’m more conscious of it now doesn’t mean it makes me any less confident in who I am or what I do,” she said
With this confidence, Brown has taken advantage of what the university offers. She noticed how UAlbany celebrates cultures. She found various organizations that help empower people of color like herself. She joined an organization called the Black Theater Production, which promotes the performing arts for people of color. In addition, Brown was awarded a journalism internship with the student affairs media team. She also joined an organization called “Her Campus,” an online magazine where she can express herself.
Tibian Ahmed, a senior at Stony Brook University, was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Ahmed, who is Muslim,
has encountered many instances when she has been racially profiled and has felt like an outcast, especially during her years of schooling.
“As early as elementary school all the way through my now final semester at college. It’s happened at work, my internships, even in personal settings meeting some of my non Muslim friends’ parents,” she said.
At times, in social settings at school, Ahmed has felt tested because of the comments made about her. She noticed how students would take pictures of her and make fun of her while she was sitting in the dining hall. People would also taunt with her hijab. Ahmed was the only girl who wore the hijab at her first school, SUNY Brockport. “People would purposely work in groups of three so that they wouldn’t work with me,” she said.
Ahmed has had uncomfortable situations with professors as well. During her freshman year at SUNY Brockport, students were assigned a 10 page research paper and the professor gave the topics to the students. The professors gave her, ‘Should the U.S Iraq war have started?” She was the only student assigned this topic. She had no choice but to comply with the professor’s request. In order to make this assignment unbiased, Ahmed made sure she asked other students if they thought the war should have started. Towards the end of her presentation, the professor stated her own biased opinion.
Ahmed has encountered other moments when professors would make thoughtless statements about Islamic terrorism or extremism and try to convince her that her hijab is an inconvenience. Also, professors at both colleges she attended have asked her how the process was for her family coming to the United States as refugees. Ahmed felt as if they were committed to setting a low standard for her by assuming she wasn’t American. Ahmed had to overcome these situations on her own because her parents didn’t have the same experiences. Because her siblings are significantly younger, they too didn’t understand what she has gone through. Ahmed also realized the significance of the date September 10, 2001, the day before 9/11. This was the day she placed her hijab on for the very first time, when she was six years old.
Although she has faced criticism, Ahmed used this to elevate herself in school instead. She began interning at CNN. She interned with white men who were middle aged and she noticed how they had a different tone with her as she stepped in to contribute.
“I get it, because they didn’t experience people like me. This is a pattern; this is how they have been taught to think, and it’s a bigger issue. It’s unfortunate, you are at a point where you can think for yourself but they chose not to, people chose not to challenge themselves because it’s more convenient for them,” she said.
Before transferring to Stony Brook, Ahmed became a speaker for the diversity conference at her first school, SUNY Brockport. She spoke out to faculty members and students about her life growing up post 9/11 and her experiences. Ahmed also founded the MSA (Muslim Student Association), which tries to bring a Muslim friendly environment to students, holding events about Islam awareness and reaching out to non-Muslim students on campus about their experiences growing up on post 9/11.
“It’s either I was going to do something to make myself feel like I belong there or just let it get to me,” Ahmed said.
At Stony Brook, Ahmed has become an executive producer for Newsbreak En Espanol and also an EOP success coach to mentor students on time management, critical thinking and writing skills.
“Don’t keep yourself in a bubble – what scares you the most is the most important thing to challenge yourself with,” she said. “You need to be respectful and make sure you are not a part of the problem.”
These students, like so many of their peers, have overcome prejudice and stereotyping by working hard and demonstrating excellence. The issue has not gone away and needs to be further addressed in our communities today.
Until then, let’s continue to work hard and demonstrate that we are all the same. It’s time to stand up and remember we are all dreamers. Let’s make the labeling stop and make America great again in this way.

Editor’s Note: In light of recent mass shootings in the U.S., the Pioneer is republishing the university’s guidelines and protocols issued in Feb. 2017 as a public service for the school community.
There have been 317 mass shootings in the United States, close to one every day, in 2017, according to the Gun Violence archive. The harsh reality of mass shootings is that they could occur at any place and anytime. Since 1999, there have been 31 mass school shootings in the United States, which have made worldwide headlines and devastated school communities. The massacres at Columbine High School, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and Virginia Tech University, among others, have led schools, including LIU Post, to strengthen their security protocols and strategize if it were to happen to them.
The LIU Post Department of Public Safety includes 22 full-time, New York State certified security officers. It is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors on LIU Post’s campus. The department works with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments, and the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management. The Public Safety Department created its own guidelines in early 2017, based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s “Active Shooter: How to Respond” booklet, which includes emergency phone numbers and tactics. The guidelines are on the university website at http://liu.edu/cwpost/Public-safety.
According to the university guidelines, “because active shooter situations are often over within ten-to- fteen minutes before law enforcement [or Public Safety] arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared both mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.” Within that time frame, the guidelines suggests to “take note of the two nearest exits,” “secure the door [in the room],” “if in a hallway, get into a room and secure the door,” and as a last resort, “attempt to take the shooter down.” If an active shooter is in your vicinity, the guidelines call to “escape if possible,” and “hideout where the shooter is less likely to find you while [remaining silent].” If you are the first person to call 911, the guidelines suggest to provide the phone operator with as many details possible, including location of the shooter, the number of shooters, if more than one, physical description of the shooter(s), number and type(s) of weapons, and number of potential victims at the location.
Michael Fevola, who became the Director of Public Safety in August 2017, said his team would rely on text messaging and emails during active shooter situations, although he has not experienced one on campus.
“In the event of an incident including an active shooter, Public Safety has protocols in place and the ability to immediately alert the entire campus community via a mass text/email blast with specific advisements and instructions,” Fevola said. “Those messages can also be used to continuously update the community, alert individuals what areas they should stay away from, and what to do, including the “Run/Hide/ Fight” protocols.” The Pioneer reported that the “Run/Hide/Fight” protocol was instituted in February 2017. “[It was] not in response to something happening, just to keep the campus safe,” Dr. John Lutz, English professor and chair of the faculty council, said in The Pioneer’s article, “Stop, Drop, Roll” published on Feb. 15, 2017. Lutz said, at the time, that faculty members had expressed an interest in learning more about campus procedures during an emergency, which led to a meeting for faculty on Feb. 1. At the meeting, Paul Rapess, the former director of Public Safety who retired last summer, discussed the new procedure, which implemented to keep up to date with happenings.
The Public Safety department routinely conducts joint training exercises with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments on campus. With this training in place, local police have a better feel for the campus during emergency situations.
According to LIU Post’s CampusFirearms & Weapons Policy, which is available on the LIU website under ‘University Policies,’ says “the possession of dangerous weapons, including any pistol, revolver, an incendiary bomb, switchblade, dagger or bludgeon, as well as harmless instruments designed to look like weapons are prohibited” on campus. “Other than police officers or military personnel on active duty, no person, including a licensee, may possess rearms anywhere on campus, whether in a building or on the grounds, without the prior written permission of the campus Provost and Director of Public Safety.” Violators of this policy will be subject to immediate disciplinary action and potential criminal prosecution. LIU Post strictly enforces its campus gun policy. As The Pioneer reported several years ago, on Nov. 17, 2011, a 72-year-old criminal justice adjunct professor accidentally shot himself in the groin and leg before his class. Although he was a retired Fire Marshall licensed to carry a weapon, the no weapons policy on campus was strictly enforced and he no longer teaches at LIU Post.
Katherine Hill-Miller, English professor and former dean of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences suggests every student and staff member should sign up for the Public Safety alerts, and said she would follow direction from Public Safety in an emergency.
“My first action would be to check for the text message and follow its directions,” Hill-Miller said. “If a message hadn’t come through, I’d assume that the incident hadn’t been reported, so I’d dial 911 first and then call campus security. Barring any information from anybody, I’d evaluate the situation—if the shooter was close, I’d gather students away from windows and doors in the classroom.”
Freshman education major Amanda Iovino agrees that the public safety alerts would come in handy in times of danger. “The texts are very useful in times of bad weather, and I think if [a school shooting] was to happen, the texts would be crucial.”
Fevola advises students and staff members to always be alert to their surroundings. While school shootings do not happen very often, he stressed that anything could happen, and one person reporting a suspicious person could potentially save lives.
“Stay vigilant and follow the old adage ‘see something, say something,’” Fevola said. “Any odd or unusual behavior should be reported to Public Safety, and we always protect [the] anonymity of the caller.”

The women’s basketball team faced the University of Bridgeport in the first game of the East Coast Conference (ECC) on Wednesday, Dec. 6. After a long off season tour, they returned to their home court to clinch a 68-61 victory.
The Pioneers are coming from 4-4 in the last eight games of the off-season. “The biggest change we need to work on is our start, we always start games slow,” Mikaiya Moore, sophomore forward, said before the Dec. 6 game. “We need start upbeat, have high energy and that will keep the pace of the game. Start well, finish well.”
The Pioneers started strong, jumping to a 9-2 lead five minutes into the contest. Bridgeport answered back with a 12-6 run to cut its deficit to one (15-14), but the Pioneers secured a 30-26 lead into the break.
Halfway through the third frame, the Pioneers took a ten point lead over Bridgeport (42-32), but the Bridgeport came back with a 10-2 tally to pull within two (44-42).
Towards the end of the second half, Bridgeport once again pulled within a basket of the Pioneers (63-61), with 1:08 to play. In the final minute of the game, the Pioneers pulled ahead to score the 68-61 victory.
Moore tallied a team-best 17 points and went 7-for-10 from the charity stripe. Shannon Doyle, junior and guard, went for 14 points and two rebounds, and Dominique Williams, sophomore guard, scored nine points.
The Pioneers will continue on to game two of the conference on Saturday, Dec. 9 when they take on Mercy College away at 12 p.m.

“Beginning in the 2019-20 academic year, LIU will compete in all sports at the NCAA Division I level, with a unified athletics program that will join our campuses into One LIU,” university president Kimberly Cline wrote in an email announcement to the LIU community on Wednesday, Oct. 3, halfway into the fall 2018 season, and two weeks after the academic add/ drop period deadline on Sept. 18.
“The unification of the Division I and Division II athletic teams into a more robust Division I program will have long term benefits for LIU and the Northeast Conference from an athletic, academic and community standpoint,” NEC commissioner Noreen Morris said during an LIU press conference at the New York Athletic Club on Oct. 3.
Along with seven Post sports teams being elevated from Division II to Division I, the LIU Post basketball (men’s and women’s), women’s bowling, women’s fencing, softball, women’s swimming, track & field (men’s and women’s), and women’s volleyball teams will move to the Brooklyn campus, where a multipurpose athletic facility will begin construction in 2019. New women’s ice hockey and water polo teams will be added in Brooklyn.
The LIU Post football team will move to the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), the lower of the two Division I levels. Football players are excited about the change, as they will not be losing their positions. LIU Brooklyn has no football team, and their stadium will be renovated to meet Division I regulations.
The announcement, which emphasized the unity of the individual athletics programs into “One LIU,” has rocked student athletes on the Post campus. For many of the Pioneers, this is not exciting news.
All Post sports teams play under the NCAA Division II, as they have since their inception. The sudden announcement of the transition to Division I in the middle of the current season has caused distress and uncertainty among many Post athletes about their future athletic and academic careers. Post students will have to re-tryout for positions on the new Division I rosters, competing with current LIU Brooklyn students and freshmen recruits for those same spots next year.
Sports that are combining include basketball (men’s and women’s), soccer (men’s and women’s), baseball, softball and women’s lacrosse. The men’s lacrosse and men’s cross country will move to the Northeast Conference.
Ashley Melendez, a senior childhood and early education major, was one of the unhappy students on the softball team. “We could not believe the news. We were all heartbroken that this selfish decision was made without even speaking to any of the athletes,” she said. “We were completely blindsided and devastated that this selfish act is going to break our family apart.”
An FAQ page posted on Oct. 3 on the new one.liu.edu, or athletics.liu.edu website addresses questions about the change. The question of Post athletes being able to continue their positions in the Division I teams has student athletes most concerned. According to the site, the athletics department “will personally work with each individual student-athlete to review all potential opportunities athletically and academically within the new athletic department.”
Newsday reported on Wednesday, Oct. 3 that, “LIU teams will draw athletes from both campuses,” but, “the 2019- 20 rosters will be decided at the discretion of each team.”
Many Post athletes, who qualified for Division II sports, fear they will not make the new teams. “There’s a chance that we might get cut. We don’t know anything; we don’t know
if we are going to keep our coach. We literally have nothing,” Jillian Lomanto, a junior education major and member of the lacrosse team, said. Without further information, Lomanto believes nothing about their team will remain the same.
The method and timing of the announcement were questioned by students and faculty. Many athletes feel underappreciated. “When the president announced it, she didn’t take the athletes’ feelings into consideration. She literally just said this is fine, she’s getting paid for this. It’s the athletes who are getting hurt right now,” Lomanto said.
The students are also concerned about their coaches. “It’ll be very hard if my coach is not the same coach [for women’s lacrosse]. If she’s [Coach Megan McNamara] not the coach, none of us are going to be playing,” Katelyn Politi, a sophomore elementary education and special education major, said.
International student-athletes were especially concerned. Those who were recruited internationally were either signed into a contract to play in Division II, or can only play in Division II based on their semi-professional athletic careers in their home countries before enrolling at LIU Post. Multiple Post teams, such as the women’s and men’s soccer teams, have rosters comprised of mainly international players.
The unified sports teams will have an even bigger impact on campus. The school’s colors will change from the Pioneers green and gold and the Blackbirds blue and black, to a unified blue and gold. The cost of replacing and redesigning the signs and facilities, including the upgrade of both campus athletic facilities, the Bethpage Credit Union Stadium and new uniforms, apparel and signage on both campuses, could be high.
The Bethpage Credit Union Stadium will receive a makeover, with upgraded grandstands to improve sight lines for fans, and to meet Division I standards. “This project will make Bethpage Federal Credit Union Stadium among the most modern facilities of its size on the East Coast and provide an ideal game day environment for our student-athletes and supporters,” according to a statement on the athletics.liu.edu site.
Roy Fergus, the director of facilities services for both campuses, did not respond to the Pioneer’s inquiries about the timing, execution and price of these projects.
Unifying the university athletic departments under Division I could help increase the profile of the school, as LIU’s administration stated in the statement announcing the change, however it will come with sacrifices, according to multiple students and faculty members.
“What’s stunning about the LIU announcement is the consolidation of sports from two autonomous campuses, one Division I and one Division II, with different colors and mascots, and telling roughly half the 1,600 student-athletes that they’ll no longer have an athletics future at LIU,” Willie Hiatt, associate professor of history, said. “We’re forcing them to compete against each other for roster spots. I can’t imagine that a ‘Hunger Games’ scenario like that happens very often.”
Hiatt believes there was an unspoken reason for the merger. “The timing of the announcement also was a slap in the face to athletes. The slick ‘One LIU’ branding didn’t happen overnight,” he said. “Why didn’t the administration make this announcement at least last spring or summer to give students the chance to find another school? With another small freshman class of 550 students or so, was this to avoid worsening our enrollment crisis? And why do this after the add/drop period? If we care about our students, we should allow them a full tuition refund if they choose to leave LIU right now. That’s the least we can do. If I were a parent, I’d be asking for that for my child,” Hiatt said.
Lacrosse player Politi agrees with Hiatt on the timing. “I don’t think [the administration] did it in the right way,” she said. “Especially for people recruited over the summer. They didn’t tell them and [the recruited students] make decisions [on where to go to school] and they had no idea that they were going from a D.2 to a D.1 program, which is a huge difference.”
Students and faculty believe that the change had been planned for some time. “If they knew about [this change] for years, they should’ve told us the summer of 2018 so people had time to digest this new information, instead of telling teams during and right
before their seasons,” Veronica Saager, a junior special education major and member of the women’s soccer team, said.
“If I was a freshman, I might look into transferring,” Lomanto said.
Student athletes are still debating their next steps. Students have created several protests on social media, including a petition that now has over three thousand signatures and a not.my.liu.post Instagram page that has over 400 followers.

“The School for Good and Evil” by Soman Chainani is the first book in a fantastic fantasy series. This first book tells the story of best friends Sophie and Agatha, living in the isolated town of Gavaldon. Every four years on November 11, according to legend, a School Master kidnaps two children from the village. One kidnapped child is always beautiful and kind, and the other is homely and odd. These children are taken to the School for Good and Evil, which exists somewhere beyond the woods surrounding Gavaldon. The children are never seen again, unless they appear in a fairy tale, one as a hero and the other as a villain.
Sophie, who is beautiful and focuses on her looks and good deeds, believes that she will be kidnapped for the School for Good. Meanwhile, Agatha, who is ugly and wears only black, doesn’t believe the School exists but seems like the perfect candidate for the School for Evil. They are the two kids who are kidnapped by the School Master that year. However, Agatha is brought to the School for Good, and Sophie to the School for Evil. What first appears to be a great mistake turns into an adventure that not only reveals the character’s truest selves, but also blurs the lines between the stereotypes of good and evil.
Along the way, Sophie and Agatha meet the other students, who are descendants of fairytale characters. The best friends from Gavaldon take classes at their mismatched schools while they try to solve a riddle the School Master gave them that will lead them home. However, the School Master is more than what he seems, and has a different ending in store for Sophie and Agatha.
“The School for Good and Evil” is a very entertaining book, but the plot doesn’t go far beyond the school. Although this series takes place in a much larger world, the first book takes place only in Gavaldon and the School. The world of fairy tales is supposedly endless, but readers don’t get to experience much of this world in the first book. One must read the rest of the series to see more of this magical world of Good and Evil.
In “The School for Good and Evil,” nothing is as simple as it seems. It is a great read for those who like dramatic twists and sneaky foreshadowing in their books.

In “Smite,” we are introduced to Ullr: The Glorious One. In the game, Ullr is designed in heavy robes and a hood, he also wears a bow and arrow and his twin axes. As a hunter god that lives in the frigid north, this design could not be more fitting.

There are many gods in Norse mythology, but few are as highly regarded as Ullr, “The Hunter God of Glory.” In both mythology and in “Smite,” Ullr doesn’t represent the boastfulness or shameful satisfaction one gets from seeing others fall. He is honorable and pays respect to true glory in all its forms.
For Ullr, glory is in the silence of snow fall, the perfect curve of a bow firing an arrow, the honorable victory earned in single combat and the moment of life’s rebirth. In Norse mythology, “The Hunter God of Glory” is an enigma ever keeping to himself. In “Smite,” Ullr is secretive and knows that true glory lies in remote hideaways, untouched by the hands of time, and it is in these very hideaways the shrines to Ullr can be found.
Ullr is highly respected even among the gods, for it his him and not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the all father is away. While other gods would abuse the power the throne brings, Ullr knows that his rule is an extension of Odin’s will.
The mythology states that Ullr is a skilled archer and an expert in close combat; this is no different in “Smite.” In the game, Ullr’s attacks and abilities revolve around his skills as a hunter. His passive ability is called weapons master; this allows Ullr to switch between fighting with his bow and his axes, and it is here that we see Ullr’s true skills. With his bow, Ullr’s abilities allow him to attack multiple
enemies at once while his axe-based abilities are for single combat.
Ullr’s second ability is called expose weakness. This allows Ullr to land critical hits easily. Just as his mythology counterpart finds glory in a bow firing an arrow true, Smite’s Ullr is able to find the perfect shot without hesitation.
Ullr’s ultimate is called Wield Axes; with this Ullr gains additional physical strength and lifesteal which allows him to deal more damage to a single enemy. This ties in to his mythology as it tells how Ullr finds honor in single combat and pays respect to his fallen foe.
While not much is known about Ullr, “Smite” does a good job of paying respect to his mythology and gives us a character that is both accurate and fun to play with.

Overlord” was released in theaters on Nov. 9. The movie is set hours before D-Day (June 6, 1944) and follows the actions of five survivors as they ambush Nazi-occupied France for a crucial mission. With the apocalypse stirring, the surviving paratroopers face some rather unusual enemies. Actor Wyatt Russell plays a key role in the film, and has appeared in several movies, including “22 Jump Street” and “This is 40.” Compared to these, “Overlord” has a darker, gorier theme.

Russell plays Corporal Ford, a “hard-headed individual whose team is caught in a tricky predicament.” He spoke about his character and the challenges he faced in his role. “It was physically demanding,” he said.
“Maintaining high energy was hard for three and a half months,” Russell said. Along with the physical exhaustion, the cast worked with dangerous equipment. “None of the gun fire was CGI (computer-generated imagery),” he said. “That’s what made the movie fun.”
Russell worked with producer J.J.Abrams who is known for producing films including “Star Trek” and “Mission Impossible: Fallout.” “It was great, knowing that as you’re acting you are being graced by the hand of J.J. is very confidence-boosting,” he said. Most of a producer’s work appears after the bulk of filming is completed. “It’s always good news when a producer doesn’t come to set [often],” Russell said.
When the film opened, Rotten Tomatoes gave it an 81 percent positive reaction. Anthony Uly, senior international business major, saw the movie on its opening date. “If you ever wished that ‘Saving Private Ryan’ was a B-movie (low-budget movie) splatterfest, it [Overlord] totally is. I really enjoyed it,” Uly said. “The cinematography was pretty good, overall storyline was unexpectedly great, and I liked the female lead; she gave me a little Wonder Woman tease.”
Russell described the movie as a “popcorn movie,” something that people go to see in the theater. “I want it to be a movie [for the audience] to go with their friends and see something that people put a lot of effort into,” he said.
Many World War, apocalyptic films have appeared over the years, but “Overlord” takes to the imagery of the apocalypse even further through the use of pyrotechnics and lack of green screens. “The best World War II movie has already been made— ‘Saving Private Ryan’— that changed the way a generation saw that war,” Russell said. “You’re not reinventing the wheel; just [looking at] a different take.”

On Tuesday, Nov. 13, Amazon announced that it would move its new headquarters to New York City and Arlington, Virginia; the corporate giant also said that it would invest about $5 billion, and each location would see around 25,000 new job openings. Sounds good, right? Well, there is another side to this story.
Corporations usually decide to locate in areas with sturdy infrastructure, a skilled workforce, and reliable transportation, so they can operate effectively. Ac- cording to The New York Times, Amazon was given $2 billion in tax subsidies for its decision to build facilities in these locations. Why is it that one of the nation’s most prosperous companies was just given $2 billion?
The answer is simple: Amazon is just one example of an alliance between the business class and the political class. Amazon’s decision to move one of its new headquarters to New York City is no accident, as the city is run by Mayor Bill de Blasio, one of the most liberal mayors in the country. Big corporations often lobby before Congress and give contributions to the politicians; in turn, the politicians give favors to the corporations.
Unfortunately, the Right has defended large corporations for years. Corporate America, however, hates the idea of free markets and competition, which are conservative ideals: according to The Daily Beast, a left-leaning website, “That’s because they have the resources to hire the lawyers needed to navigate regulations, and the lobbyists who can help change the rules if necessary.” Companies like Amazon end up becoming monopolies, and competition from small business is crushed. There is nothing conservative about this practice, just as there is nothing conservative about most big corporations. It is just the opposite: they are the backbone of the Democratic Party.
If you were to check the donor lists of Democratic candidates like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, you would find that many large corporations often donate generously to Democrats. According to AlterNet, the Walton family, the owners of Walmart, gave over $300,000 to Hillary Clinton in the last election.
For all the yammering we hear from Democrats about the evils of corporate America, they certainly have no problem taking donations from large corporations for their political campaigns.
The Republican Party deserves some blame, too: in order to satisfy the business interests that fund their campaigns, establishment Republicans often are silent on the issue of illegal immigration and border security, as they want to provide cheap labor to their corporate donors. A mass influx of low-skilled labor often puts downward pressure on the wages of Americans. Many on the Left are right to say that corporate America deserves some skepticism; the problem is, they are enabling the very practices they claim to be fighting against.

The name Mia McLeod will go down in women’s ice hockey program history. On Tuesday, Oct. 8, the Sharks received their first player recognition in the New England Women’s Hockey Alliance as Mia McLeod was named “Rookie of the Week.”
The Canadian received the award after a well-deserved weekend of play. In the Sharks’ inaugural opening night against University of Connecticut, McLeod faced 53 shots and made 49 saves. This left the freshman goalie with a save percent-age of 93 percent after her first night of play. 
Head Coach Rob Morgan had been watching Mia in net since his days coaching at Yale University. He had first seen her play at the age of 14, and once Morgan was named the head coach at LIU, “it was a no brainer,” about bringing McLeod to come play for him, he said. 
McLeod began playing hockey at the age of eight, but didn’t become a goalie until she was 10. The first time she tried the goalie position, McLeod was hooked.L “You do rotations as a goalie and everyone gets a chance and it was my turn and I just kind of stuck with it. I liked it and I felt kind of good at it,” McLeod said. 
As a five-sport athlete in high school, Mia McLeod is no stranger to a highly competitive environment. She competed in cross country, volleyball, hockey, track, and ultimate Frisbee. 
“Ultimate Frisbee was really fun, I had never played it before and then I started in grade ten and it was just something to do on the side, and it was really fun,” McLeod said.    
With hockey at the top of McLeod’s list of favorites, track and field came as a close second of the sports she’s participated in. McLeod also competed as a pole vaulter for three years in high school. 
“It was something different to do than hockey but just learning how and flying in the air in pole vaulting was really fun,” she said. 
The Sharks have left their footprint in Division I Ice Hockey as they became the first ever program on the island. However, for McLeod and her squad, it hasn’t been an easy task. The Sharks’ biggest challenge for both coaches and players is having such a young team. With 23 team members, 21 are freshmen. The other two players are transfer students that came in as a sophomore and a junior. “Usually, it’s your seniors that will set the tone or raise the bar because it’s their last year to try and win. But right now, they have four years to win. We want to have that mindset that we are a team that can win our conference every year,” Coach Morgan said.
McLeod also feels the pressure of having a young team. However, she reminds herself that they are making history. She believes that she and her team can take their skills and strengths and win a conference championship. 
On Friday, Oct. 18, McLeod and her team will take on reigning National Women’s Ice Hockey Division I Champions against the University of Wisconsin Badgers at their home arena in Syosset, New York.

The 2019-2020 women’s ice hockey team is the first in program history, and it is also the first Division I ice hockey program on Long Island. Head Coach Rob Morgan put together a team he believes will continue to make history. “I recruited every kid and everyone was recruited here for a reason, not just to fill a jersey, but to be a part of something special,” he said. 
The Sharks opened their season with an exhibition match against a professional women’s ice hockey team, the Metropolitan Riveters. The Sharks lost in a 10-3 battle, however they saw it as a great game to prepare them for the regular season. “Getting that first look at the kind of talent, speed, and strength we will be up against this season was an awesome learning experience,” junior captain Morgan Schauer said.
The Sharks officially kicked off regular season play with two games against University of Connecticut. While the Sharks lost in back-to-back days to the UCONN Huskies, the games showed the determination and potential they have in games to come.
In the first game against UCONN, freshman goalie Mia McLeod stood out, making 49 saves on 53 shots. A week later, McLeod made history as the first LIU ice hockey player to win conference recognition, as she was named “Rookie of the Week.” In the second game against UCONN, freshman forward, Carrigan Umpherville scored the first goal of the regular season for the Sharks. 
The early season schedule is made up of some extremely challenging games, including reigning NCAA Division I champions University of Wisconsin. The team played University of Wisconsin on Friday, Oct. 18 and Saturday, Oct. 19. Before the game, Coach Morgan said he expected a tough game, but that nothing is decided beforehand. “I know how good they are and our team knows how good they are. But the outcome is determined after 60 minutes. So, we are gonna go out there and play our hardest and give them a good game,” he said.
The Sharks fought hard but fell in both games with the scores of 2-10 and 0-12. However, the team is taking these games as learning experiences, according to freshman captain, Matilda af Bjur. “Playing against the best is an indescribable feeling. We have a way to go to get there, but it is a journey me and the team are ready to do,” she said.
Junior captain, Morgan Schauer, also had a positive outlook on the loses to the Wisconsin Badgers with the belief that these games are “going to make us stronger and help us to build up our program.”
In addition to play against high ranked teams, one of the biggest challenges the team has faced is the youth across the team. Twenty-one out of their 23 team members are freshmen. “It’s a pack of puppies running around,” Coach Morgan said. 
Without seniors on the team, Morgan said the team lacks the looming sense of a “last ride” among seniors. They don’t have the mindset that this is their last year to win. “Usually, it’s your seniors that will set the tone or raise the bar because it is their last year to try and win. But right now, they have four years to win,” Morgan said. 
Up next for the Sharks is two games against Coach Morgan’s former team, Yale University. The games are being played on Friday, Oct. 25 and Saturday, Oct. 26.

Sammy Bell, junior psychology major, is a forward on the field hockey team, as well as the team’s leading scorer. During her time playing as a Shark for the fall 2019 season, Bell scored nine goals and 20 points throughout the 14 games the team played. 
Bell hails from Scotland and started playing field hockey there when she was seven years old. After playing field hockey in high school, Bell decided to attend college in America and chose LIU after Head Coach Raenee Savin got in contact with her. “Coach Savin reached out to me and I had never been to America before so I was very excited,” she said.
Bell played the previous two seasons with the Post Pioneers. As a freshman in 2017, she co-lead the team in assists, and along with 11 goals, she finished third on the team’s scoring list with 35 points. In 2018, Bell was second in all three categories with 16 goals, seven assists, and 39 points. 
Bell had a slow start to this season, but between Sunday, Oct. 13 and Friday, Oct. 25, she scored six goals in four games, including an overtime goal against Sacred Heart University, her second that day. Bell said the reason for her recent success is due to her team. “They have been hyping me up and playing better to win and want me to do well,” she said. Bell has also taken 62 out of the team’s 155 shots this season. She thanks senior midfielder and team captain Taylor Brodsky for that statistics. “Taylor is the reason I have many shots, as she is able to set me up for good scoring opportunities,” she said.  
Brodsky predicts Bell will have a big impact in the upcoming games. “She’s a big part of our team and we rely on her a lot,” she said. Bell is a great player with a humble attitude, but she needs pushing from her captain, according to Brodsky. “She needs to be pushed a lot but she is a very humble player and it’s been an honor to play with such a good field hockey player, and especially to be the person that pushes her every day,” she said.     
Junior goalkeeper Rachel Vellis is one of Bell’s close friends and said that she loves to see her score. “She is my best friend and gets me really hyped up. It gets me excited when I hear the echo from the other side of the field,” Vellis said. She also said that Bell is a strong presence on the field and brings a lot of energy.  
Coach Savin has coached Bell for three years and said she has seen her develop from a freshman who wasn’t prepared for the amount of conditioning collegiate field hockey requires, to one of the team’s most valuable players. “The summer after her freshman year, she made a huge adjustment, which helped prepare her for the great season that she had last year,” Savin said. “Sammy has been a huge asset for our team and we need her to keep putting the ball in the back of the net because very often we come out on top when she’s scoring.”  
Going forward, Bell and the field hockey team play their last games of the regular season on Friday, Nov. 1, against Fairfield University and on Sunday, Nov. 3, against Temple University. The Sharks will then prepare for the NEC Tournament since the team secured a spot in the playoffs with a 1-0 win over Bryant University on Sunday Oct. 27. They are the first Shark team of the new Division I program to claim a playoff berth. The NEC championship tournament is being hosted in Staten Island at Wagner University on Friday, Nov. 8 and Sunday, Nov. 10.

Update – On Wednesday, Oct. 14 an additional 20 cases were reported on the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, bringing the total number of reported cases since Oct. 10 to 33.
Editor’s Note – The Pioneer chose to keep quotes given to us by athletes anonymous out of respect for their privacy.
At least 14 students have tested positive for COVID-19 due to off campus gatherings attended by several members of various athletic teams, according to an email from Chief of Student Affairs and Alumni Engagement Michael Berthel on Sunday, Oct. 11. 
The affected students and individuals who they were in close contact with are required to quarantine for two weeks. Anyone who is in a class with a student who tested positive has been notified, according to the email. The email also states that the university will be disinfecting all impacted areas, but does not specify what areas on campus have been affected.
The university shared the email with students and staff when they became aware that off campus gatherings had occurred, according to Berthel.
“The University immediately coordinated its response with the Department of Health. We are working in close cooperation with the Department of Health on contact tracing in accordance with their Contact Tracing Program, and notifying all students and faculty who are in classes with these individuals,” Berthel said. “Anyone who had been in contact with these students would have been notified by this point.”
The incident comes soon after the NEC announced winter athletics we’re supposed to start on time on Nov. 25.
On Saturday, Oct. 10, 11 positive cases were reported on the university’s COVID-19 dashboard, bringing the total number of reported cases for the two week from Sept. 27 to Oct. 10 to 19. On Sunday, Oct. 11 a new two week period that will last until Friday, Oct. 23 began, with a total of 13 positive cases being reported thus far. It is unclear how many cases are directly related to the gatherings.
All athletics have been paused for one week, and several athletic teams are currently quarantining as precautionary measures, according to Berthel.
One student athlete of a team not involved in this incident was upset because their practices have been cancelled for at least a week. 
“Everyone has been working super hard to be able to practice again, and because of a party it’s all on hold again,” they said. “None of us even heard of a party or anything and then next thing you know it’s shut down.”
The university currently has 85 students in quarantine, and 39 out of the available 50 quarantine rooms are currently in use, according to the New York State COVID-19 Report Card website.
Some athletes are afraid to speak out about the situation, fearing possible negative consequences.
“Athletes are being quiet about this incident in fear of negative repercussions from the athletic department,” one athlete said. “Although their information could be the difference between life and death to students with underlying health conditions.”
Disciplinary action against the students who attended the gatherings is being considered, according to Berthel. No details about what consequences may occur are known at the moment.
Some students, such as senior psychology major Nicole Ludwig, feel that the university needs to do a better job with enforcing social distancing guidelines on campus.
“The school needs to do more than send text messages and emails to enforce social distancing guidelines,” Ludwig said. “I’ve seen so many students walking around with their masks either below their noses or completely off without any consequences, and have even seen giant groups of friends eating together.”
In his email to the community, Berthel urged the student body to follow the university’s social distancing guidelines. 
“I understand that this pandemic has required sacrifice and you yearn for the social and emotional connection that has become synonymous with your LIU experience. We want that for you too,” the email stated. “However, the stakes are too high and we cannot take chances. Remain vigilant, renew your commitment to keeping yourself and our community safe, and act in a manner that demonstrates a genuine concern for your peers, your faculty, and your loved ones.”
Berthel would like to see the university have no new cases, which is something that can only be possible if students follow the universities COVID-19 guidelines.
“LIU will continue to respond immediately to positive cases when or if they occur. The positive test rate on campus is below county and state levels, but the university goal is to have zero cases,” he said. “All members of the LIU community are reminded to adhere very closely to LIU’s health guidelines: wear a face covering at all times when in public spaces on campus; practice physical distancing, do not gather in large groups; complete the daily health check-in; wash your hands regularly; stay home when you’re sick and seek immediate medical attention if you’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.”
Senior psychology major Sarah Ren, feels that while the university has done a good job regarding their COVID-19 protocols, the university’s dashboard does not provide enough information to keep the campus community informed. 
Ren would like to see the dashboard include the total number of cases the campus has experienced since the beginning of the semester. She feels that only showing positive cases from a two week period makes the situation appear less serious then it might otherwise be if the total number of cases were shown, and that students would be less likely to break social distancing guidelines if they had all of the information. 
Senior broadcasting major, Matthew Valentino thinks that the behavior displayed by some students is unfair to commuting students who have to put their families at risk.
“Now the students who commute and have to come on campus, but also be around their parents, or possibly grandparents, are putting themselves at risk, and everyone else around them at risk as well,” he said. “All because these kids want to have their college experience.”
Ludwig understands that the students who attended the parties most likely wanted to have a normal college experience, but thinks that what they did was reckless and dangerous.
“I think it’s very selfish to be trying to go to a party right now. I know so many people feel robbed of their college experience, and I can empathize with that, but your college experience isn’t going to mean as much to you if you find out someone you love has died from COVID,” she said. “And the longer we refuse to follow guidelines, the longer it’ll take for things to return to normal. To not follow the rules is to openly admit that you do not care about the safety of yourself or other people, and I don’t have any respect for that.”

The coronavirus pandemic has changed what the world once knew as normal. In-person activities, such as going to school and work, have taken on a new version of normality via virtual experiences. With many classes being moved online, hands-on professions like nursing have declined educationally because of the quality universities are able to teach these fields online.
When the coronavirus began spreading to college communities back in March 2020, universities sent students home, regardless of their major or area they were studying. Nursing students began taking classes online. For many, senior clinicals were cancelled for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester. 
Senior clinicals are an important time and experience for those about to graduate and enter the nursing field because they are a chance for students to work one-on-one with a nurse in a specific field of nursing, get real on-the-job experiences, and work in a hospital.
First-year registered nurse Jenna Doherty’s clinicals were canceled and she is now unsure about starting her first job at Stony Brook University Hospital. “I believe I missed out on a huge opportunity to learn on the job experience when my senior clinical was canceled,” Doherty said. “Now that I am beginning my first job I am a little nervous that I have not been in a hospital or practicing nursing since March and that my nursing skills are going to be rusty.”
Doherty is not alone in this. Many universities across the nation cancelled their clinical programs for the spring semester, meaning Doherty is just one among many who lost this experience and are now applying for jobs as registered nurses. 
Currently, only a few universities have resumed their senior clinicals. Long Island University Post campus is one of these schools. However, even the in-person clinicals are very different from how they were pre-COVID. 
“Clinicals are still very educational, however not as educational as they would usually be,” senior nursing student Amanda Masullo said. “We aren’t allowed to do certain things. For example, inserting an NG tube or basically anything that has to do with the patient’s mouth, nose, bodily fluids, etc. It’s a shame because these are the times when you’re supposed to do things hands on and learn and we’re kind of deprived of that.”
Across the nation,  nursing majors have had to be flexible and work within the different universities regulations. For example, universities are encouraging online courses, lectures, and labs. Nursing classes or simulations that were always taught in the classroom before the pandemic are now primarily online. 
Doherty, a recent graduate from Post whose senior spring semester of nursing school was moved online, said that she was very lucky to have professors who were dedicated to helping the students learn. However, in her opinion, taking the more information-heavy classes required for sophomores and juniors would have been much more difficult to take online. 
Another big change to the nursing major is how the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) examination is now taken and passed. The NCLEX examination is a nationwide test used to administer the licensing of nurses in the United States, Canada, and Australia. The test is set up to have students apply and analyze questions and scenarios that should have been taught and understood while in nursing school. After graduating, nursing students must pass this exam before they are deemed a qualified registered nurse.
Many changes have been made to this exam due to the coronavirus pandemic. The exam time has been shortened from six hours to four hours and they have decreased the amount of correct questions from 75 to 60 in order to pass the test. The maximum amount of questions has also been decreased from 265 questions to 130 questions. They have also removed pre-test questions and research section questions. 
The coronavirus pandemic is not only affecting those who are currently in nursing school, but is also heavily affecting those who recently finished school and are looking for jobs in the nursing field. 
Healthcare companies have also implemented a hiring freeze in many hospitals due to the coronavirus and this is making it difficult for those who have recently graduated to find jobs. Once recent graduates can find jobs, they are being required to do more online learning and simulations as a form of orientation. 
Doherty was just recently hired by Stony Brook University Hospital as a Neurology ICU nurse. Instead of in-person training and orientation, she is being required to take an online two-week orientation course. After finishing nursing school online and then having to continue training online, this orientation makes Doherty concerned and uneasy. “Usually during orientation, you get to learn the ropes of the hospital and where everything is,” she said. “Also during orientation, they bring you to a sim lab to go over a crash course of nursing fundamentals which will now all be online as a simulation.”
The integration of online learning for nursing school and job orientation is an impacting factor that is creating uneasiness and worry through the nation’s young and learning nurses. These impacts of the coronavirus in the medical field will have a lasting effect within healthcare.

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic illness that affects millions of families each year. According to the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, PD is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. Modern medicine and neurologists have been developing stronger and more effective treatments for this disease every year. 
Dr. Gemma Moya-Galé is a professor at LIU Brooklyn  and speech-language pathologist who researches PD. Her expertise can be most notably witnessed in her recently published article “The effects of intensive speech treatment on intelligibility in Parkinson’s disease: A randomised controlled trial”, where she discusses the newfound breakthroughs in the use of intensive speech treatment to improve speech intelligibility for those with PD.
“Our study was the first one to examine conversational intelligibility gains in a randomized controlled trial for PD and we were able to provide evidence of treatment benefits to improve that aspect of their lives. The clinical implications for this are, therefore, huge,” Moya-Galé said. 
Moya-Galé’s goal is to improve the quality of life in her and her colleagues’ patients. Her study that was published by the Lancet took six years to complete, and contained documented and verified research supporting both Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD) effectiveness, as well the importance of physical activity. 
“Close to 90% of people with PD develop voice problems over the course of the disease. One of the most devastating consequences patients face in their quality of life is social isolation and withdrawal, given that they lose the ability to be understood, particularly in noisy environments. Once voice problems have appeared and worsened, many patients may decide not to partake in conversations anymore, out of frustration, for example.” 
In order to get a better understanding of the disease itself, Moya Galé elaborated on what exactly the nature of the disease entails.
 “The disease is progressive and it may start long before a diagnosis is made, loss of smell could actually be one of the first signs. Getting the right treatment is crucial, as many times modifications to medication have to be made based on patients’ reactions to it.” 
LSVT LOUD treatment, is the most well researched and understood kind of treatment used to treat individuals. The LOUD part of the treatment, refers to patients using their loud voice, and emphasizes use of sounds like “AH” at various pitch tones, in order to rehabilitate their speech. 
“[LSVT LOUD] is currently the gold standard in the treatment of hypophonia in PD. It also has decades of research behind it that show its benefits in improving not only voice, but also facial expressions, or even swallowing,” she said. 
Moya-Galé said that LSVT LOUD has significantly improved intelligibility and patients with PD’s ability to be understood. This is important because there is a gap between the communication levels of the patient with PD and their caregivers. Improving the communication between the patient and the caregivers will improve the overall mental well being and stability of those with PD because they will know that they can still speak clearly enough to be understood. 
Moya-Galé believes that exercise is also essential to improving the neuroplasticity in patients with PD. Neuroplasticity is the concept that the brain can still learn, improve and remain malleable even within the patient’s final years being alive.
 “Physical activity not only improves aspects like balance and walking, remember that people with PD are at a greater risk of falls, so addressing these problems is very important for overall safety, but it can also increase quality of life, for example, by fostering and prolonging the individual’s independence,” she said.
Moya-Galé urges those with PD to begin rehabilitation as soon as possible.
“Rehabilitation is key in PD, and the earlier someone starts receiving those services (including physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and such) the better. Rehabilitation services undoubtedly improve quality of life and we, as therapists, advocate for their early implementation,” said Moya-Galé. 
While she does hope there will be a cure in the traditional sense, she still noted that there are factors within our control that can prevent the disease interfering drastically with the patients lives. 
“As for habits or factors that could have a protective role; exercise is key. Physical activity has tremendous benefits …  not just for maintaining good physical function but also cognitive function.” 
Moya-Galé continues to study PD and work as a speech pathologist in order to foster independence in patients so that they can keep their voice for as long as possible.
Her work not only continues to impact the lives of not just her patients, and their families, but the scientific community, who research PD and attempt to learn how to effectively treat those who develop PD, at any stage of their life.
For more information about speech therapy treatments for PD, refer to Moya-Galé’s research on “The Lancet”.

The Scottish actor Sean Connery has died at age 90 in his sleep. His career spanned for seven decades and he was best known for his portrayal of James Bond. 
Connery became a top box-office star in both Britain and the United States in 1965 after starring in “From Russia With Love,” “Goldfinger” and “Thunderball.” He would go on to star in seven of the Bond series films. More than Agent 007, Connery went on to play a widower obsessed with a woman who is a compulsive thief in Alfred Hitchcock’s “Marnie” and as an amoral poet in the satire “A Fine Madness.”
Throughout his career he acted in more than 60 movies, leaving behind a legacy that many believe will last forever. 
“He was an amazing actor and his continuations to the medium are astounding,” Senior marketing major Anthony Cavarretta said. “He taught us how to play it cool as Mr. Bond and he is one of the main reasons Indiana Jones and the last crusade is my favorite movie of all time.” 
Connery died in the Bahamas, surrounded by loved ones after feeling unwell for some time according to his son, Jason Connery. Connery’s wife, Micheline Roquebrune, would later add that he had struggled with dementia before his passing. 
Senior arts management major Brianna Savarino said ”He was a super talented actor. Everyone knows the line, Bond, James Bond.”

This year marked a historic moment within the NASCAR Cup Championships. Chase Elliot took home first place earlier this month in his eleventh victory of the series.
Elliot captivated his fans, following in his father’s footsteps, Billy Elliot, another Cup series champion.
Freshman adolescent education major Ryan Kaim was enthusiastic about Elliot’s championship win. “Overall, Phoenix put up an unexpected champion and a fan favorite when it seemed somewhat unlikely through 2020,” he said. 
The unexpected victory comes as a surprise to fans and other drivers who seemed to have a greater chance of winning. 
Denny Hamlin and Kevin Harvick initially dominated in this year’s series. Those racers were eliminated from the playoffs after compounding weaker results than the other drivers, making  them unable to qualify. 
This year, Phoenix Raceway in Phoenix, Arizona, hosted Championship Weekend. This marked the first time the city has ever hosted a championship race. 
The final race was not looking great for Elliot in the first half. However, Kaim thought he did a fantastic job playing out the remainder of the race. “Chase Elliot started from the rear after his car failed inspection twice, but he clawed through the field and led near the halfway point, dominating through the remainder of the race, taking the checkered flag,” Kaim said.

Colder weather on campus means that items like blankets are a must. The Long Island University Field Hockey team is selling blankets available for purchase. The blankets are $60 each and found  on their Instagram page @liufieldhockey. 
Field Hockey Head Coach Raenee Savin says that she got the inspiration for the blankets from a recruiting trip a few years ago. “I was recruiting at a high school field hockey playoff game in late November, and as I stood there freezing, all the fans in the stands were wrapped in their warm blankets, all matching and supporting their team,” she said. “Right after that, I placed our first order! It was perfect timing, as our field hockey team played into December for the NCAA finals.” 
This is not the first year the blankets have been for sale and the blankets have evolved with the school. “We started selling these blankets in the C.W. Post Pioneers generation of LIU. Sales continued as we kept the green and gold,” Coach Savin said. 
Coach Savin is confident the tradition of these blanket sales throughout the colder months of the year have been a success. “Still now, as we transitioned to the blue and gold, LIU Sharks blankets are keeping fans warm in the stands,”she said. “Eight years later, we continue to sell,and get excited with each sale, knowing that our customers are always happy with their purchase!”
While @liufieldhockey recently posted about the blankets, Savin says that anyone can buy the blankets at any time. “There is no end date. We just had a surge in blanket sales and placed another order, but we always have them available for purchase,” she said. 
Additionally, anyone can buy these blankets with shipping or pickup.“For a small additional fee, we are able to ship your blanket.  We also provide contactless pickup on campus,” Savin said. 
Savin encourages everyone to buy a blanket for their practicality and ties to campus. “These blankets are meant for everyone, not just sports fanatics! I keep one on my car and one on my couch. I use it when I travel,” she said  “These blankets wash easily, are super comfortable and are a great way to show off your Shark spirit, great for incoming freshmen or graduating seniors, a blanket in the dorm or even for an alum as a reminder of your years at LIU,”
You can email raenee.savin@liu.edu or brittany.robertson@liu.edu to purchase.

On Thursday, Sept. 30, the music department was given breaking news: the music education major is being frozen. This means that any incoming student at Post may not choose music education as a major, but the students who are already part of the program will be able to finish out their degree.
More news came for other arts students soon after. On Oct. 8, students in the department of theatre, dance and arts management received word that recruitment into the dance and arts management programs would freeze after this school year. 
With programs freezing, students are left wondering if they should stay at Post and what the future holds for their education.
“We got an email from Dr. McRoy who is the director of music education. He wasn’t beating around the bush at all. He just said ‘unfortunately the school has decided to freeze the music education major,’” sophomore music education major Ally Perticone said.
A large majority of the students found out this information while they were in chorus class.
“We were in chorus and everyone’s jaws dropped. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. After all the time and effort we put in,” senior music education major Kaitlyn Sottung said.
The music education majors and their faculty have worked hard to build their program.
“I want the administration to know that people are hurting. It’s not only us, it’s also the faculty. I feel very bad for everyone in my department, especially the faculty because I know how much hard work they put into this. I see the hard work that everyone puts in,” sophomore music education major Mike Shapiro said.
Students in the program thought that  all of their hard work and effort was paying off, especially seeing as the university advertises the music program on various media platforms.
“I think it’s just really unfair. The school portrays their music program and all the opportunities we have here as this great big deal, which it is,” Perticone said. “It’s a really good program we have here. But I hate that they portray it as something bigger than it is. If it’s so great, why are they getting rid of it?” 
There is even a banner on campus stating that Post was rated the best music school on Long Island.
“This program is so near and dear to me and to watch it be ripped away from future students is heartbreaking,” Sottung said.
Some students hope that others will join them in trying to fight for their program, while others think there’s no chance of restoration.
“When they took away the Fine Arts Center (FAC), we were able to advocate for ourselves and help restore the program by having the school put practice rooms in Hillwood. So, I think if we really get the word out and talk to higher administration to fight for our program, it might help,” Shapiro said.
“I personally think that fighting for it isn’t going to work. This is not something we can change their minds on. I don’t think it’s worth trying for,” Perticone said.
The next steps for the music program are unclear at this time, as students and faculty alike continue to grapple with this sudden change despite the decision that the school’s administration made. It’s clear the music community on campus is still strong, and will continue to focus on their craft as long as the school’s administration allows them to.
Students from the dance and arts and administration department are also fighting for their programs.
Junior dance major Abby Steinke recalls all of the opportunities she has received through Post’s dance program.
“We’ve had the opportunity to see companies and work with artists that are high calibre. We’ve been able to choreograph ourselves, like I’ve gotten to choreograph and make my own artistic voice show,” Steinke said.
Steinke says that the Post Concert Dance Company (PCDC) is like a family. She doesn’t think she would be the person she is today without it.
Steinke and the rest of PCDC found out Friday Oct. 8 that their program was to be frozen at the end of the year.
“I was shocked,” Steinke said. “The first thing I wanted to do was be like, okay what can we do to stop it? I’ve been emailing administration, and I messaged the theatre company to email them. I think strength in numbers really works. I think if everyone has something to say about it, then they should listen.”
Steinke has some ideas on how to get the campus’ attention, other than emailing.
“We’re thinking of doing some video things, maybe some flash mobs. The dance program has a big presence in the department, but we need to make that known to campus,” Steinke said.
Steinke believes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a big impact on this decision. She says that last year the dance program was meant to bring in 13 new students, but ended up only bringing in three. 
“I think we need a chance to grow as a program through the pandemic and not getting a chance seems unfair,” Steinke said.
Steinke’s next steps are getting as much attention as possible from as many people as she can.
“Email your president, email Promise, email your dean, email our dean, email chairs; email anyone you can. These programs are important and they are bringing more people to this school. They are bringing culture to this school, arts to this school,” Steinke said.
Steinke urges the administration who is cutting these programs to listen to the students.
 “Please listen to the student body, please listen to what we have been sending you, please reconsider the freeze,” Steinke said.

ESPN’s Monday Night Football (MNF) broadcasts are shaking up by introducing a secondary broadcast featuring the National Football League’s favorite brothers, Peyton and Eli Manning. Starting this NFL season, the Manning bros will host their own show during 10 of the 16 Monday Night Football games, bringing in guests to help commentate on ESPN’s second channel, ESPN 2. Dubbed the “Manning-Cast,” the show has been nothing but successful and has seen its ratings climb each and every week.  
The success of the new Manning-Cast challenges the traditional style of NFL broadcasting and suggests that it may be time for a change. The almost century-old style of broadcasting football games may not be the best way to engage fans in the game anymore, especially the highly coveted younger audience. With the NFL focused on engaging younger and diverse audiences, a new broadcasting style similar to that of the Manning-Cast could be the secret to reaching this target audience. Clearly, the Monday Night Football broadcast between the two beloved NFL legends has the potential to shake up the sports broadcast landscape. 
Traditionally, the NFL broadcast consists of a play-by-play man along with a color commentator, with the play-by-play usually being an individual with broadcasting experience, and the color commentator being a former coach or player who can provide insight into the minds of the coaches and players. These two individuals help guide the audience through the game, providing commentary on what is happening while also conveying additional information that might interest the fans. 
The MNF broadcast between the two NFL legends is structured a little differently, as the brothers cover the game from separate locations, using a Zoom-style format to connect with each other and the guests. Throughout the course of the game, Peyton and Eli cover the game, analyze the highlights, and interview a variety of guests, ranging from current and former NFL players and coaches. This format gives the brothers more freedom to crack jokes, go off on rants, and entertain the fans without having to stay focused on calling each and every play of the game. 
The Manning-Cast has been met with near-universal praise by fans across social media, as many praised the brothers for their on-air chemistry and unique football knowledge. 
As stated by Ryan Boettcher, a Junior Broadcasting major at LIU Post, the Mannings provided a more “information-based knowledge towards the game,” while also having that “brother rivalry which led to a ton of comedic moments.” Boettcher admitted that he preferred this Manning-Cast over the traditional ESPN broadcast, citing that the conventional was more for the “casual fan,” while the new broadcast provided “more of a laid back broadcast for the knowledgeable fan.”
While Boettcher and a majority of fans were crazed about the Manning-Cast, some weren’t as intrigued. Like most things, it only takes one Twitter search to find sharp criticism about MNF’s newest broadcast. From brief technical issues to problems with the format and commentating from the brothers, critics had plenty to complain about. Mike Fiorio, an analyst for NBC, went as far as to say the broadcast was “unnecessary” and made the game “generally hard to follow.”  
It has been no secret that the NFL has been trying to reach a younger and more diverse audience while also retaining the die-hard fans that help make it the most successful sports league in America. Over the past few years, the NFL has expanded their presence on social media, launching the Playmaker’s Program on Instagram, and expanding their football coverage to Facebook, Amazon Prime Video, and even Nickelodeon. They have also continued their efforts to expand the league globally, playing two games in London this season, and approving at least four international games per year for future seasons. 
With the NFL putting an emphasis on expanding their audience, the success of the Manning-Cast shows that the answer to their woes might be in their broadcasts. In its limited time on-air, the Mannings have captivated the sports world and have drawn more attention and viewership each week. This early success indicates that it may be time for a change in the sportscasting industry, as the old way of broadcasting may not be the best way to reach a wider audience. 
Bob Costas, a long-time NBC broadcaster, suggests that the Mannings success may not be able to be replicated, as the dynamic between the brothers makes the broadcast so entertaining. Without that chemistry, alternate broadcasts could struggle to reach “the Manning level.”
While Costas may be skeptical, the Manning-Cast has opened the door for a new form of sportscasting and has made a splash in a nearly century-old industry. With the success of the Mannings’ broadcast thus far, the NFL will undoubtedly explore this further, as having alternate broadcasts to their primetime games could be the key to reaching new audiences and expanding the game we love.
While the Manning-Cast wasn’t perfect by any means, the overwhelming amount of praise and media attention shows there is plenty of support, which is a good sign for the future of this new alternate broadcast, and any others that may follow.

Lucid Motors(LCID) 
The electric vehicle industry is exploding, and Lucid Motors is no exception. CEO and CTO Peter Rawlinson was previously the VP of engineering at Tesla, and was also the head engineer of the Tesla Model S. After working high up under Elon Musk, Rawlinson moved onto Lucid in 2013, and is now the main man on the business and tech side of one of Tesla’s top potential competitors. Lucid has jumped nearly 100%, almost doubling in one month, and now sits at $44 a share with a market cap of $72 Billion. Lucid is still yet to sell cars on the road, but have been test driving the Lucid Air and Lucid Air Dream, with all of their production models sold out. These units should be given to the public by early next year, as well as 20,000 additional units manufactured, sold, and put on the road.
Coinbase(COIN)
With the Crypto market cap eclipsing over $3 trillion, the top exchange in the world is seeing the benefits. As Bitcoin and other cryptos eclipse all time highs, more people are looking to get in on the action. After fluctuating back and forth since its IPO on April 14, Coinbase is up over 50% in a little over a month, now listed at $357 a share, with a market cap of $93 Billion. 
Visa(V)
On the other hand, Visa has been taking a tumble it’s all-time-high over the summer. However, this does not seem to be something worth stressing over for shareholders, as retail and blue chip stocks have their down quarters every once in a while. We saw quick rebounds for Visa during the pandemic when people got back to work, and continued to use credit as interest rates went down tremendously last fall. Visa is trading at $213 a share, with a market cap of $465 Billion. 
Litecoin(LTC)
As previously mentioned, the crypto industry is soaring, and the hype around alt-coins(alternatives to Bitcoin) is going up with time and knowledge of the sector. Litecoin is one of the oldest alt-coins with a strong backing and history. Litecoin is up nearly 45% in the past week alone, and is stretching towards its all-time-high of $412. After taking a tumble in May, we have seen slow steady growth up to $266, and a market cap of $19 Billion. The longevity and consistency of Litecoin looks to be good long term.

Emotional support animals have become increasingly popular among college students in the last few years. The idea of having a pet as means of emotional support, and helping someone get through something, has become more common in recent years.
As of 2019, there were 200,000 emotional support animals in the United States, many of which are dogs. This number is up exponentially since 2014, when there were only 2,400. They are classified as service dogs, since they are used to assist people with their mental health.
When a puppy is trained to be an emotional support animal, the training can take anywhere from 14 to 24 months.
Certain emotional support animals, classified as psychiatric service dogs, can only be obtained by individuals who fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
However, any other person can obtain a regular pet that can double as their emotional support animal.
“An emotional support animal to me is a pet that comforts you through your trials and tribulations. Emotional support animals help with academic stress, as well as depression and anxiety that comes from coursework throughout the semester,” junior theatre arts major Gabriella Beckman said. 
Many college students feel anxiety and elevated stress throughout their semesters, and feel that emotional support animals could help.
Post currently allows students to have emotional support animals. According to liu.edu, “It is LIU’s policy to permit Service Animals, as defined below by the Americans with Disabilities Act, in all approved campus areas; and it may permit Emotional Support Animals (Support Animals), as a reasonable accommodation, in the residence halls for students with a documented disability.”
“They help with stress, anxiety, and just managing emotions,” sophomore nutrition and dietetics major Amanda Battista said.
Emotional support animals can be a tool for anyone who has a psychological disorder and needs an emotional companion, as well as just the average person looking to have a stress reliever in their life.
“I feel as though an emotional support animal could help me tremendously. Whether it be the support animal sensing an anxiety attack, or just taking a break from life to just be with your support animal, it would help,” Beckman said.
Beckman and others agree that emotional support animals should be allowed in college dorms because of the support and aid they can give students.
“I love them. I would say that they should be allowed as long as they are specifically trained to be an emotional support animal,” Batista said. “They would have to go through special training where they are taught to understand human emotions, as well as not bark and disrupt other students in the dorms. I think there should be a separate dorm section for them, and that some sort of doctor’s note should be used as well.”
In today’s age of mental health awareness, emotional support animals are being touted as a tool to help not only the depressed, but also the average person.
“Honestly, the campus should have emotional support animals for everyone. It’s proven that they help people control their emotions and just relax,” Battista said.
With the popularity of emotional support animals continuing to rise, many questions arise, such as how schools will react to and accommodate an influx of students bringing emotional support animals to college with them.
Many also wonder how other institutions will react to people having emotional support animals.
The U.S. Army does not allow emotional support animals on military bases because they are not classified as service animals. However, if a soldier lives in their own apartment, they can have any type of pet they want.
Many questions will arise in the following years about how accessible emotional support animals should be to the public, as well as where they should be allowed. It is up to institutions to decide how these animals should be accepted.

Post is home to the inaugural class of the Positive Transitions to Work (PTW) program. The program is offered through Positive Behavior Support (PBS) Consultation in collaboration with the campus’ Center for Community Integration.
PTW is a two year program where college aged adults with developmental disabilities can learn vocational skills in a group of cohorts. The PTW program focuses on supporting independence and personal growth.
Students are exposed to six different career field options identified as important by the US Department of Labor; human Resources, business, communications, health, agriculture and manufacturing.
Though only in its inaugural year, the PTW program is being well received by students.
“I’m loving it so far. I learned that I appreciate not just writing but also there’s several other jobs people can take and how each of those jobs contribute to society whether low or high,” PTW student Victor Hoang said.
Hoang loves art, writing and fiction. 
”It’s a very calm, peaceful environment where we do group sessions and activities as a group, so that we’ll be given time to learn and develop,” Hoang said.
Hoang has been working towards the goal of providing for himself and his family through the PTW program.
“I wish to work independently and lead a more independent life, and also to help my mother make some money in order to live a fulfilling life, and in order to do that I need to learn how to work,” Hoang said.
Behind every student there is a mentor. Hoang’s mentor is Victoria Arias. Arias is part of Post’s early childhood education masters program.
”I just look forward to coming and hanging out with Victor. He’s given me some movie recommendations. We just learn more about each other everyday. It’s been a great experience, and meeting everyone else too has been fun,” Arias said.
Arias signed on to be a mentor for the PTW program in order to fulfill some hours needed for a course, but ended up staying for the experience.
“I had never worked with anyone with any developmental disabilities, I have some family members that have some disabilities, but this was the first time for me. This was for a class to get some hours, but honestly, I’ve done more than I ever had to for class just because I enjoy spending time here,” Arias said.
Arias says she learned confidence from Hoang. He is far more outgoing than her, while she is more of an introvert.
“I never really put myself out there to try new things, I never thought that I would be a mentor for anyone. I just think this is a great opportunity and I hope to continue,” Arias said.
The PTW program interviews less than half of the applicants they receive applications from, and accepts less than half of those interviewed. The program is selective, but this ensures the students coming in are ready to work.
One hope Arias and Hoang share for the PTW program is that the Post community would be more receptive to them. 
“I wish more people knew about the program and signed on to be a mentor and tried to include them in the community and be friends with them too,” Arias said.
Hoang wishes more people knew about the program, and signed up to be part of it as well. 
“I want them to know that if they know somebody that has a developmental disability of some sort. A young adult looking for a purpose in life, I recommend them coming here, where they can learn about themselves,” Hoang said.
Hoang encourages anyone on the Post campus to introduce themselves to any PTW student, they are looking to be a part of the campus community as well.For more information on the PTW program, visit https://www.positivebehavior.org/ptw.html.

From Friday, Sept. 30, to Sunday, Oct. 2, the Sharks women’s golf team competed among 16 universities in their third competition of the season at the Navy Fall Invitational. 
The Sharks finished fifth as a team. However, out of 88 total competitors, it was Sharks’ senior Emily Byrne who came out on top. Her 2-over-par score of 146 was three strokes ahead of the second-place finisher, Anna Ferreyra-Heit from Delaware State. 
This is Byrne’s first season at LIU after playing three years at Limestone University in South Carolina. 
Byrne was also the Sharks’ top performer over the first two events of the season. At the Delaware State Fall invitational on September 19-20, Byrne finished fifth individually, only one stroke away from tying for first with the other top four golfers. 
In the week leading up to the Navy Fall Invitational, Byrne finished first for the Sharks at the Boston College Intercollegiate. 
Byrne is from Liverpool, England, but knew for many years she had a goal of playing golf in the NCAA. 
“I’ve been playing golf for about 10 years now, and ever since I was about 14 or 15, I had friends who were coming over here and started playing college golf,” she said. “Then, when I got to about 15 and 16, I set my heart on playing golf and then getting to the collegiate level.”
With a combination of her athletic and academic plans in mind, Byrne had her heart set on coming to the Big Apple to finish her collegiate career. 
“I was down in South Carolina, and I decided I wanted to change and started looking in terms of location to be a business major,” she said. “I wanted to head up to New York, and then I started looking around this area and found LIU. I looked at the team, then started communicating with the coach and decided it was definitely the school for me.”
Bryne knew it was going to be important to make an impact early on in her playing time here at LIU, and she could not have wished for a better outcome. 
“It’s amazing, I’m just on cloud nine right now. Coming over here, I didn’t know where my golf was going to be. I had quite a big injury over the summer, and I was not sure if I was going to be able to play at the level I knew I could,” she said. “After I got here and had all the encouragement from the team and all the support I needed, to come and play really well is big for me.”
Despite the conditions of the long weekend, Byrne credits her performance, along with that of the team, to the perseverance they have shown so far this season.
“We had very bad weather the whole time. We had the back end of the hurricane, so we just wanted to get through and stay as dry as we could,” she said. “Just knowing I had to get through it and stay strong mentally helped it.”
Byrne was named a Northeast Conference (NEC) Prime Performer for the month of September. She could not have been more thrilled for the honor.
“I was really shocked and just couldn’t have expected this first month to go any better, so I’m excited to see the rest of the season and see how I do,” Bryne said.
Bryne looks to capitalize on her success early on at LIU and collectively carry it throughout the rest of the season.
“The goal is definitely to win the conference with the team we have and a great set of girls who have the ability to do it,” she said. “Personally, I just want to enjoy the last two years that I have of college golf with a great team.”

On the first day of classes, your professor will often hand out a packet either physically or digitally titled “Syllabus.” The syllabus is a contract between the professor and the student outlining the student’s responsibilities, and what rights they have access to. Many students will often take a glance, review it with their professor during class, and shove it into their backpack for it to never be seen again. The other portion of students may read through it to better prepare for their class. 
Students can expect to find important information such as resources, deadlines, classroom policies, and contact information for office hours. In some instances, a student might find money. 
In an entrepreneurship course, one professor hid a message within two of his class’ syllabi. The text read, “There is one envelope in Dean Fusaro’s office with $40 in it. Just ask her and it’s yours. The first student from the class that finds it gets it.” 
Entrepreneurship professor and CEO of Sage Marketing, Daniel Klein, explained why it’s important for students to read the syllabus.
“I think it’s very important because it tells them how to do well in the class, so to me the syllabus is the instructions for how to do well,” Klein said. “I would hope that students would at least glance at it or look it over. Mine are very specific, I’ll give them all the rubrics for any midterm, any finals. I’ll tell them exactly what they need to do to pass the class — I want the students to do well, I’m going to show them how to do well, and all they have to do is read it.”
Out of everyone in Klein’s classes, only one student came forward to claim the prize. Freshman business administration major Talia Romito was the first— and only— student to secure the forty dollars hidden within the syllabus. 
“I definitely think you should read your syllabus. It helps me personally a lot just to get an idea of the classes you’re going into and just prepares you for your year to come,” Romito said. “I’ve always read my syllabus since high school and I plan to continue doing so throughout my four years here.”
Even after professors emphasize the importance of their syllabus, students still tend to ignore it or not look through it carefully. 
“I think students skip reading the syllabus because it can be long and overwhelming,” Klein said. “You need to know where to look. If I were a student I would definitely look at the rubrics if there are any in there. It’s a bit overwhelming because a typical syllabus is twelve or fourteen pages long.”
Reading the syllabus is often looked at as being responsible for knowing what’s going on in the class. 
“I feel like I went in [to class] like I could answer some questions based on the syllabus,” Romito said. “I kind of knew what my professor was talking about. — gives you an advantage going into the class, you’re not going in blind.”
Hiding money within the syllabus is not something professors typically do, but Klein found it to be an interesting way to see if his students were reading the material.
“I saw that a professor at another college did something like this and I just thought it would be fun to test out to see if anyone would find the money,” Klein said. 
“My initial reaction was confusion… Why did it say to pick up forty dollars in the dean’s office?” Romito said. “At first I thought it was a joke, I actually didn’t pick it up until four or five days after, because I thought it was just a joke and didn’t want to go and embarrass myself. So one day, I asked Professor Klein after the end of class, and he said no it’s not a joke and no one has picked it up so go pick it up you deserve it. Then, I realized it was real and it was pretty cool, I felt proud.” 
In the eyes of an entrepreneur, a couple of lessons can be learned from this experiment. 
“My classes teach entrepreneurship, one of the keys of entrepreneurship is knowing when to look out for opportunities that other people don’t see. So as an entrepreneur, if you find out or figure out an idea before other people, that can be your whole business. I want to teach them through experiential learning that there are opportunities everywhere, where you least expect it. That’s why I hid it inside the syllabus,” Klein said.
“I think that if you’re given the opportunity, take it,” Romito said. “I had the opportunity to win forty dollars and I was hesitant at first, if I didn’t go and see if it was real, I would have never won the money. So I say go with your gut and take the opportunities presented to you.” 
Seeing how this lesson was mostly entrepreneurial, how could a professor in another field of study take this type of experiment and apply it to their course?
“I would suggest that they could put something like this in some of their content where students would have to find the certain information and then the professor would know that they are not just reading information and taking a test, but they’re really understanding the content that they are doing,” Klein said.
In the future, Klein’s students may be more inclined to read their syllabi.

Many storylines were going into the MLB playoffs this year. The Dodgers were going into the playoffs with an incredible 111-win regular season. The Mets and Yankees returned as the NY baseball powerhouses. The Seattle Mariners broke the 21-year streak of no playoff appearances, and it was the last ride for the St. Louis Cardinals’ big three in Albert Pujols, Adam Wainwright and Yadier Molina.
For the Wild Card Round, The Mets came into the last week of the season as world series threats and locks for the NL East title, but that all changed in their final three-game series against Atlanta. The Mets had their best three pitchers for that series and could control their division title destiny and avoid the wildcard round as a two-seed in the National League (NL). However, this was not the case, and they had to host a three-game win-or-go-home series against a struggling San Diego Padres team. The Padres were hit hard this season with their star Fernando Tatis Jr being suspended for performance-enhancing drugs (PED’s). So going into the playoffs, all the Padres had was Manny Machado and newly acquired Juan Soto as major bats and a deep starting rotation and bullpen. This Wildcard series was the first of many upsets, with the Padres winning in Queens due to a pivotal game three performance by Padres’ starting pitcher Joe Musgrove. He put up 5 K’s and only one hit in his seven innings of work, which set up the 6-0 shutout victory. 
The Padres had a bunch of people step up in this series, with Trent Grisham hitting homers in back-to-back games and Josh Bell adding a bunch of clutch hits.
The Mariners finally broke the 21-year playoff drought and were faced to play the Toronto Blue Jays. The Blue Jays hitting was evident throughout the series, with multiple home runs from Teoscar Hernandez in game two, but the underdog Mariners wouldn’t go down for the count, winning the first game in a 4-0 shutout, then sealing the deal with 10-9 victory in game two. The Mariners were down as much as six runs, but still prevailed. Seattle was guaranteed a home playoff game for the first time in over two decades.
The Philadelphia Phillies closed the book on the last ride for the St Louis Cardinals’ legends in a 2-1 series victory. The red birds took game one in demanding fashion with a 6-1 win on the backs of Mike Mikolas’ five strikeouts and Corey Dickerson’s three RBI’s. However, the power bats of the Phillies overwhelmed St.Louis in the next two games.
The youthful Cleveland Guardians swept the Tampa Bay Rays thanks to pitching performances by Shane Bieber and Triston Mckenzie. Beiber and Mckenzie both fanned eight batters in their starts. Game two was an outright pitching duel going 15 innings with a combined total of 39 strikeouts, the most ever in a postseason game, capitalized by a 15th-inning walk-off by Oscar Gonzales. The Guardians were able to complete the sweep and head to the division series.
The Division Series was filled with upsets and close games. The best team in the league, the 111-win L.A. Dodgers were upset by in-state foe San Diego Padres in four games due to big performances like Yu Darvish’s seven strikeout outing in game two, homerun from Trent Grisham in game three and an eight strikeouts performance from Joe Musgrove in game four. 
The Yankees prevailed in a five-game series win over the Cleveland Guardians. The Bronx Bombers were down 2-1 in this series and had fans on the edge of their seats as they had to win two straight to stay alive in the playoffs. Harrison Bader was up for the challenge by hitting three home runs in the series and Gerrit Cole’s eight strikeouts in game four. 
The Atlanta Braves were out-slugged by the Phillies in four games. Philadelphia bats were on fire, hitting nearly double (24) the amount of RBI’s that Atlanta hit (13). 
Sophomore undeclared major–and longtime Braves fan–Eric O’Neil was stunned by the Phillies’ upset.
“There was no answer for the Phillies’ offense. Every ball hit off the bat was either a home run or a base hit,” he said.
Bryce Harper showed up big time for Philadelphia with two homers and five RBI’s in the series.
The Houston Astros swept the Seattle Mariners. The Astros re-established their dominance over their AL West rival. The Astros came back down three runs with a walk-off homer by Yordan Alvarez in game one, setting the tone for the rest of the series.
The stage was set for the Yankees vs. Astros in the American League Championship Series (ALCS), but the outcome was disappointing for Yankees’ fans. Instead of a back-and-forth series, with a win-or-go-home game seven like in 2017, The Yankees were on the receiving end of a disappointing four-game sweep.
Freshman sports management major Daniel Frankenberry was upset with the lack of competitiveness displayed by the Yankees.
 “We couldn’t hit with runners in scoring position. Our bullpen was hurt at the worst time possible, and Gerrit Cole gave up five runs. We got owned,” he said.
The Yankees were silenced by the Astros’ pitching by striking out 50 times throughout the series. Jeremy Pena won the ALCS MVP, which was well deserved due to his two home runs and four RBI performance during the series.
The long ball was prevalent in this seven-game National League Championship Series (NLCS) between the San Diego Padres and Philadelphia Phillies. These two wildcard teams had to take down the best of the best to get to this point, and the way they did that was by hitting a lot of home runs, with 16 home runs combined. The Phillies were able to get past San Diego in five games due to Bryce Harper’s two home runs and five RBI’s, Rhys Hoskins’ four home runs and seven RBI’s. Bryce Harper won the NLCS MVP for his efforts.
The Phillies and Astros will compete for the World Series title in a best-of-seven series starting on Friday, Oct. 28.

With the NHL just over a month into its season, there have been quite a few surprises, growing expectations for teams and potential new audiences growing in the league. 
One of the biggest standouts so far this season in the NHL is the Buffalo Sabres. Last season, the Sabres traded away their franchise player Jack Eichel to the Las Vegas Golden Knights after contract disputes and disagreements over his surgically repaired neck rehabilitation. 
After this trade, the Sabres turned their focus to a full-on youth movement. Highlighted by their young stars in Owen Power, Jack Quinn and Casey Mittelstadt, the Sabres are currently defying all expectations, as they currently sit seventh in the Eastern Division, just behind the powerhouse teams in the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers. 
In addition to the Buffalo Sabres, another team that has stood out after a month of play is the Philadelphia Flyers. Under new head coach John Tortorella, the Flyers have come out with new energy and have been playing at a high level versus tough competition. Right now, the Flyers are fourth in the very tough Metropolitan Division and have been getting great production from Defenseman Tony DeAngelo, as he has two goals and six assists in 12 games.
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell spoke about these early season surprises from the Sabres and Flyers. 
“I’m definitely surprised by the Sabres and Flyers so far. I thought that the Sabres had potential, but I did not think they would be this good this quickly,” Campbell said. “I expected the Flyers to be awful, but they’re playing well so far. I’m sure that they’ll fall off at some point.” 
Highlighting the two New York hockey teams, the Islanders and Rangers both are off to great starts this season. Right now, the Rangers are fifth in the Metropolitan Division with 15 points, and the Islanders second in the division with 18 points in only 14 games played. 
The Rangers and Islanders are being led by their elite starting goaltending. Reigning Vezina award winner Igor Shesterkin is currently 6-2 with 2.58 goals allowed per game average. On the other side, Ilya Sorokin is 6-3 with 2.20 goals allowed per game. 
In addition, these two teams have some of the most explosive offenses in the league. The Rangers currently have one of the NHL’s top three performers in the month of October with Artemi Panarin, while the Islanders are scoring the sixth most goals per game with 3.6.
Even though the Rangers have a top three star of the month, graduate speech pathology student Ryan Branigan wants his favorite team to add a mega-star into the mix. 
“A trade rumor that’s been popular has been for Patrick Kane. I don’t know if that is the best move given what it would take to get him, but that move would obviously be an exciting one,” said Branigan.
Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks has been rumored as a New York Rangers trade candidate as his time in Chicago is starting to become clouded with a youth movement and contract issues beginning to bubble. With or without Kane, Branigan went on to mention how important this season is for the fans and supporters of the Rangers. 
“The Rangers’ expectations are at least to make the Stanley Cup, if not win it. Anything less than another deep playoff run will be looked at as a disappointment,” Branigan implored. 
Brady Campbell, a fan of the Islanders, also has high expectations for his favorite team. 
“Obviously, there were some things that were out of their control last year, but they were also not good. Most of the core is still here, and I definitely think this team should be a playoff team,” Campbell explained. “They are built for the playoffs, so once they get there, I think they could make a run, but the first important thing is to get back to the dance.” 
Though the NHL season is just beginning, hockey fever is starting to sweep over New York once again, with Stanley Cup dreams in sight.

The 2022 Major League Baseball season has concluded. This immediately leads into the MLB offseason, which brings about all the free agent signings, trades and any other roster moves made by every major league club. 
The Yankees and Mets have both been at the forefront of much of the coverage surrounding offseason news. After breaking the American League home run record and being named AL MVP, Yankees superstar Aaron Judge became a free agent following his first six seasons in pinstripes. 
On Wednesday, Dec. 7, it was announced the Yankees and Aaron Judge agreed to a 9-year deal worth $360 million. 
This is the third largest contract in baseball history, only trailing extensions given to Mike Trout and Mookie Betts. It is also the largest deal ever for a free agent. 
Just one night prior, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman reported Aaron Judge was headed to the San Francisco Giants, but immediately corrected himself after jumping the alert. 
After the announcement of Judge returning to the Bronx, it was confirmed Aaron Judge turned down a 10-year deal from the San Diego Padres worth $400 million. The Average annual value (AAV) from the two offers is the same at $40 million. However, Judge would have received an extra year had he accepted the Padres’ offer. 
Senior digital art & design major Anthony Hines confirms resigning Aaron Judge was the Yankees’ top need this off-season. 
“One of the Yankees’ top priorities, much like how it was of the utmost importance, was to re-sign Judge,” he said. “The face of your franchise and the AL MVP had to be back in the Bronx, especially after he hit 62 home runs and broke the American League home run record.”
Hines believes Judge should be named captain to secure his legacy as a career Yankee.
“I would expect the Yanks to give Judge the captaincy. They made the commitment, he’s a Yankee for life, now let’s give him that honor,” he said.
Hines is happy with the acquisitions the Yankees have made so far but would love a couple more pieces to be brought in. 
Besides Tommy Kahnle, the Yankees have brought back Anthony Rizzo and Judge. I wouldn’t be surprised if we land Carlos Rodon to pair him well with Gerrit Cole in our rotation,” he said. “I wanna say we’ll make a sneaky run at Dansby Swanson. I just have that feeling.”
On the other side of the Whitestone Bridge, the Mets have been making many acquisitions as the third offseason of Steve Cohen’s ownership continues to bring high hopes to fans. 
Despite two-time CY Award Winner Jacob Degrom leaving in free agency, signing a 5-year, $185 million contract with the Texas Rangers, the Mets quickly looked for other pitching options. 
The Mets locked up 17-year veteran and reigning AL CY Young Award winner Justin Verlander to a 2-year deal worth $86,666,666, with a vesting option worth $35 million in 2025, pending Verlander pitches 140 innings in 2024. 
This is similar to the 3-year, $130 million deal the Mets agreed to with Max Scherzer last offseason. Currently, the Mets have both Scherzer and Verlander for the next two years, each making $43,333,333. With Scherzer now 38 years old, and Verlander heading into his age 40 season, it is clear the Mets will try and get the final productive years out of the veteran starters. 
The Mets also signed Japanese phenom Kodai Senga to a 5-year, $75 million deal following his 11-year career in the Nippon Professional Baseball League. 
Junior broadcasting major Brady Campbell had high expectations for the Mets’ off-season. 
“My top priorities were retaining our guys, especially Edwin Diaz, Brandon Nimmo and DeGrom, while also looking for hitters and bullpen help,” he said. 
Following his incredible 2022 campaign, which featured 32 saves and a 1.31 ERA, the Mets brought back their closer Diaz to a 5-year, $102 million deal with a 6th-year club option. 
Campbell believes it was crucial for the Mets to make the signings to keep their pitching at a top-tier level. 
“It was huge to get Verlander and Senga. After DeGrom and Walker left, I wasn’t sure where we would pivot to, but Steve Cohen and Billy Eppler were able to go all out to win over some of the best pitchers on the market,” he said. “Verlander may be older, but he is still one of the premier pitchers in the game, and Senga has superstar potential. Those two moves were very important after losing DeGrom and Walker.”
The Mets also re-signed outfielder Brandon Nimmo to an 8-year, $162 million deal following his seven seasons in a Mets uniform. Campbell believes bringing back a home-grown talent was a great move. 
“Nimmo has always been an important player on this team. He may not be a superstar, but the type of way he plays is very unique. He is a very consistent and disciplined hitter, and he is always reliable in the outfield,” he said. “He’s always the hardest worker, and you can see how much he loves being a Met. He is a fan favorite, and I think he can play a crucial role in this team’s pursuit of a championship.”
Campbell has high hopes for the Mets’ future following their moves so far. 
“I am very happy with what has been done thus far. I still think they need another big bat or two and a few more bullpen arms, but overall I am pleased and very excited for the 2023 season and beyond,” he said.

A Mexican Christmas celebration called Los Posadas was celebrated on campus, on Wednesday, Dec. 5. In Spanish, Las Posadas means “the inns” or ”the lodgings” and represents the Biblical journey of Mary and Joseph as they searched for a shelter in Bethlehem before the birth of Jesus.

“This is the Catholic event on Christmas season,” said Father Ted Brown, the chaplain at LIU Post’s Interfaith Center. “From nine days before to the Christmas Eve, Latin American Catholics do this custom every night,” he stated.
Traditionally in Mexico, people gather in a neighborhood home to have a party each night from Dec. 16 to 24. Children get dressed as shepherds, angels, Mary, and Joseph. An angel leads the guests carrying candles to the house—in this case, a dorm. They sing a carol to ask for shelter, and then the host sings a reply regarding their request. After that, guests are welcome to have a party. They end the party with a pinata shaped like the Christmas star. The last day of Las Posadas is on Dec. 24, which is followed by midnight mass, the celebration of Jesus Christ.
People who took part in the custom gathered in the campus chapel, and then the journey began. Students played pilgrims who traveled from house to house searching until they reached a designated home where Las Posadas would be celebrated. First, they made rounds to each dorm, carrying candles with them. When a group of around 15 students reached each dorm, they sang a carol such as “Joy to the World.” After going around the dorms, they went to the Interfaith Center, which is regarded as the shelter, and decorated the chapel.
“I came to join this because it sounded fun,” said Aimee Biernacki, sophomore Healthcare Administration major. “It is a good way to come together with other students, so I want to come back again next year,” she added.
This was the fourth celebration for Matt Mason, senior Criminal Justice major. “As it gives me [a sense of] community, I came to this since I entered LIU Post,” he stated. Mason added that he would have wanted join this seasonal custom even if he weren’t a Catholic.
“Originally, Las Posadas is a Catholic custom, but it is not only for the Catholic on campus” said David Armas, junior Sociology major, who is the vice president of the Newman Club Catholic Community, LIU Post’s Catholic student organization. He continued, “Las Posadas this year was really successful. Many people stayed [until] around 11 p.m. to decorate the chapel.”
The Interfaith Center is currently decorated with a Christmas tree, along with green and red lights. The decoration was done by those who took part in Las Posadas.

On Friday, Oct. 13, the day before Homecoming, students were surprised to find 25 new yellow bicycles spread out across the campus, with multiple bikes chained to bike racks in front of Post Hall, Brookville Hall, the library, and between Nassau and Suffolk Halls.
Students received an email from President Kimberly Cline later that day, explaining that the new bikes had many uses, “whether it is rushing to your next class or squeezing in a quick workout.”
Students were expected to follow an “honor code,” according to the president’s email. Students were given the code “1954,” to unlock bike chains and to use the bikes at their own pleasure on campus, free of charge. Unfortunately, within days of their introduction to the campus, bikes were missing or damaged. Some bikes were hidden around campus, or taken into buildings and rooms to keep other students from being able to ride them. Another instance that occurred included the use of a personal lock to chain the campus bike.
Scott Carlin, the director of Center for Sustainability, is delighted that the administration offered on-campus bicycles to students.
Several years ago, students in the department of Earth and environmental science explored several alternative bicycle options for the campus. “Student research included working with third-party companies that manage and maintain the bicycles, [create] bicycle paths on the campus, and working to make sure that bicycles, pedestrians, and cars can share the campus safely,” Carlin said.
Carlin went on to say that it is not unusual for new bike programs to experience growing pains, and posed the same questions many students are asking. Should students be able to borrow bicycles anonymously or should they need an ID to borrow them? What happens with at tires and other maintenance issues? Who will be responsible?
Campus Life did not comment on the misconduct with bikes on campus. “We are excited to hear the initial feedback about the bike program. Students have been riding bikes around campus and we are happy that the program has been such a success,” Michael Berthel, dean of students, said in an email. His email goes on to state, “As with any new program, we are constantly evaluating to determine future improvements and enhancements.
Students who have feedback regarding the program are encouraged to contact the Campus Concierge at 516-299-2800.”

Editor’s Note: In light of recent mass shootings in the U.S., the Pioneer is republishing the university’s guidelines and protocols issued in Feb. 2017 as a public service for the school community.
There have been 317 mass shootings in the United States, close to one every day, in 2017, according to the Gun Violence archive. The harsh reality of mass shootings is that they could occur at any place and anytime. Since 1999, there have been 31 mass school shootings in the United States, which have made worldwide headlines and devastated school communities. The massacres at Columbine High School, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and Virginia Tech University, among others, have led schools, including LIU Post, to strengthen their security protocols and strategize if it were to happen to them.
The LIU Post Department of Public Safety includes 22 full-time, New York State certified security officers. It is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to provide a safe and secure environment for students, faculty, staff, and visitors on LIU Post’s campus. The department works with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments, and the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management. The Public Safety Department created its own guidelines in early 2017, based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s “Active Shooter: How to Respond” booklet, which includes emergency phone numbers and tactics. The guidelines are on the university website at http://liu.edu/cwpost/Public-safety.
According to the university guidelines, “because active shooter situations are often over within ten-to- fteen minutes before law enforcement [or Public Safety] arrives on the scene, individuals must be prepared both mentally and physically to deal with an active shooter situation.” Within that time frame, the guidelines suggests to “take note of the two nearest exits,” “secure the door [in the room],” “if in a hallway, get into a room and secure the door,” and as a last resort, “attempt to take the shooter down.” If an active shooter is in your vicinity, the guidelines call to “escape if possible,” and “hideout where the shooter is less likely to find you while [remaining silent].” If you are the first person to call 911, the guidelines suggest to provide the phone operator with as many details possible, including location of the shooter, the number of shooters, if more than one, physical description of the shooter(s), number and type(s) of weapons, and number of potential victims at the location.
Michael Fevola, who became the Director of Public Safety in August 2017, said his team would rely on text messaging and emails during active shooter situations, although he has not experienced one on campus.
“In the event of an incident including an active shooter, Public Safety has protocols in place and the ability to immediately alert the entire campus community via a mass text/email blast with specific advisements and instructions,” Fevola said. “Those messages can also be used to continuously update the community, alert individuals what areas they should stay away from, and what to do, including the “Run/Hide/ Fight” protocols.” The Pioneer reported that the “Run/Hide/Fight” protocol was instituted in February 2017. “[It was] not in response to something happening, just to keep the campus safe,” Dr. John Lutz, English professor and chair of the faculty council, said in The Pioneer’s article, “Stop, Drop, Roll” published on Feb. 15, 2017. Lutz said, at the time, that faculty members had expressed an interest in learning more about campus procedures during an emergency, which led to a meeting for faculty on Feb. 1. At the meeting, Paul Rapess, the former director of Public Safety who retired last summer, discussed the new procedure, which implemented to keep up to date with happenings.
The Public Safety department routinely conducts joint training exercises with the Old Brookville and Old Westbury Police Departments on campus. With this training in place, local police have a better feel for the campus during emergency situations.
According to LIU Post’s CampusFirearms & Weapons Policy, which is available on the LIU website under ‘University Policies,’ says “the possession of dangerous weapons, including any pistol, revolver, an incendiary bomb, switchblade, dagger or bludgeon, as well as harmless instruments designed to look like weapons are prohibited” on campus. “Other than police officers or military personnel on active duty, no person, including a licensee, may possess rearms anywhere on campus, whether in a building or on the grounds, without the prior written permission of the campus Provost and Director of Public Safety.” Violators of this policy will be subject to immediate disciplinary action and potential criminal prosecution. LIU Post strictly enforces its campus gun policy. As The Pioneer reported several years ago, on Nov. 17, 2011, a 72-year-old criminal justice adjunct professor accidentally shot himself in the groin and leg before his class. Although he was a retired Fire Marshall licensed to carry a weapon, the no weapons policy on campus was strictly enforced and he no longer teaches at LIU Post.
Katherine Hill-Miller, English professor and former dean of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences suggests every student and staff member should sign up for the Public Safety alerts, and said she would follow direction from Public Safety in an emergency.
“My first action would be to check for the text message and follow its directions,” Hill-Miller said. “If a message hadn’t come through, I’d assume that the incident hadn’t been reported, so I’d dial 911 first and then call campus security. Barring any information from anybody, I’d evaluate the situation—if the shooter was close, I’d gather students away from windows and doors in the classroom.”
Freshman education major Amanda Iovino agrees that the public safety alerts would come in handy in times of danger. “The texts are very useful in times of bad weather, and I think if [a school shooting] was to happen, the texts would be crucial.”
Fevola advises students and staff members to always be alert to their surroundings. While school shootings do not happen very often, he stressed that anything could happen, and one person reporting a suspicious person could potentially save lives.
“Stay vigilant and follow the old adage ‘see something, say something,’” Fevola said. “Any odd or unusual behavior should be reported to Public Safety, and we always protect [the] anonymity of the caller.”
